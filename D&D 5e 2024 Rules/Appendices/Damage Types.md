## Strategic Considerations

### Best General Damage Types
1. **Force** - Almost never resisted
2. **Radiant** - Rarely resisted, many undead vulnerable
3. **Thunder** - Rarely resisted
4. **Psychic** - Good except vs. mindless creatures

### Types to Be Cautious With
1. **Poison** - Many immunities
2. **Fire** - Common resistance, but also common vulnerabilities
3. **Necrotic** - Undead often immune

### Mixed Damage Spells
Some spells deal multiple damage types:
- **Ice Storm**: Bludgeoning + cold
- **Flame Strike**: Fire + radiant
- **Destructive Wave**: Thunder + radiant/necrotic
- **Meteor Swarm**: Bludgeoning + fire
