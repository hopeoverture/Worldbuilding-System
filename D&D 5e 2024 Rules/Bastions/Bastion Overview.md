# Bastions Overview

Bastions are special strongholds that player characters can acquire and develop over the course of a campaign. They provide a home base, generate resources, and offer unique mechanical benefits through specialized facilities.

## Acquiring a Bastion

Characters typically gain access to a bastion at **5th level**. The DM determines how this occurs:

- **Grant**: Given by a patron, noble, or organization
- **Inheritance**: Left by a deceased relative or mentor
- **Purchase**: Bought with accumulated wealth
- **Conquest**: Claimed from defeated enemies
- **Discovery**: Found and restored (abandoned tower, ruined keep)

## Bastion Progression

Bastions expand as characters level:

| Level | Bastion Points | Special Facilities |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 5 | 0 | 2 basic facilities + 2 special facilities |
| 9 | 4 | +1 special facility, enlarge 1 facility |
| 13 | 8 | +1 special facility, enlarge 1 facility |
| 17 | 12 | +1 special facility, enlarge 1 facility |

**Bastion Points (BP)** are used to acquire new special facilities or enlarge existing ones.

## Bastion Turns

A **Bastion Turn** occurs every 7 days of in-game time (or at the DM's discretion for faster-paced campaigns). During a Bastion Turn:

1. **Issue Orders**: The character issues orders to each special facility
2. **Resolve Events**: The DM rolls for bastion events (if any)
3. **Collect Benefits**: Facilities produce their outputs

Characters don't need to be present at their bastion for a Bastion Turn to occur, but some orders require the character's presence.

## Facility Types

### Basic Facilities
Every bastion includes these at no cost:
- **Bedroom**: Personal quarters
- **Dining Room**: Communal eating space
- **Kitchen**: Food preparation
- **Parlor**: Receiving guests
- **Storage**: General supplies
- **Courtyard**: Open gathering space

Basic facilities provide no special mechanical benefits but establish the bastion as a livable space.

### Special Facilities
These provide unique benefits and require space allocation:

| Facility | Size | Primary Benefit |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Arcane Study | Roomy | Craft scrolls, research spells |
| Armory | Cramped | Store and maintain weapons/armor |

### Facility Sizes
- **Cramped**: Minimal space, limited capacity
- **Roomy**: Standard facility, normal operation
- **Vast**: Large-scale facility, enhanced output

Facilities can be **enlarged** by spending Bastion Points, upgrading their size category and improving their benefits.

## Hirelings

Each special facility requires **hirelings** to operate. Hirelings are handled abstractly:

- **Cost**: Included in facility maintenance (no separate tracking)
- **Loyalty**: Generally loyal if treated fairly
- **Capabilities**: Skilled enough to operate their facility
- **Limits**: Cannot adventure; handle only facility duties

### Hireling Complications
Occasionally, hirelings may:
- Request time off or raises
- Report unusual occurrences
- Be targeted by enemies
- Provide unexpected assistance

## Bastion Events

During each Bastion Turn, the DM may roll on the Bastion Events table or choose an appropriate event:

| d100 | Event Type |
|------|------------|
| 01-50 | No event (normal operation) |
| 51-65 | Beneficial event |
| 66-80 | Complication |
| 81-90 | Opportunity |
| 91-100 | Threat |

### Event Categories

**Beneficial Events**
- Unexpected windfall (extra gold or resources)
- Skilled traveler offers services
- Reputation boost in local area
- Discovery of hidden feature

**Complications**
- Facility malfunction requires repair
- Hireling dispute needs resolution
- Supply shortage affects production
- Neighbor complaint

**Opportunities**
- Merchant offers rare goods
- Potential ally seeks meeting
- Information about adventure hook
- Investment opportunity

**Threats**
- Thieves target the bastion
- Monster incursion
- Political pressure
- Rival sabotage attempt

## Bastion Defense

If enemies attack a bastion:

**Passive Defense**
- Walls, doors, and basic security
- Hirelings can delay but not defeat determined foes

**Active Defense**
- **Barracks**: Trained defenders (1d6+2 guards per Roomy facility)
- **Fortifications**: Walls, towers, murder holes
- **Traps**: If workshop has been used to create them
- **Magic**: Wards from Arcane Study or Sanctuary

The DM determines attack outcomes based on the bastion's defenses, attacker strength, and whether the character is present.

## Maintaining a Bastion

### Costs
Basic maintenance is abstracted—income from facilities generally covers upkeep. Only unusual circumstances require gold expenditure:

- **Repairs**: After attacks or disasters (50-500 gp)
- **Upgrades**: Adding special features (varies)
- **Expansion**: New construction (500+ gp)

### Neglect
A bastion left completely unattended for extended periods (1+ months) may suffer:
- Hireling departure
- Facility degradation
- Squatter occupation
- Monster infestation

## Multiple Bastions

Characters can only benefit from **one bastion** at a time. If a character has multiple properties:
- Choose which is their "active" bastion
- Other properties don't generate bastion benefits
- Can switch active bastions during downtime (takes 1 week)

## Shared Bastions

An adventuring party can share a single bastion:
- Each character contributes their facility allowance
- Combine facilities for a larger, more versatile base
- Bastion Turns affect all facilities
- Ownership and decision-making should be discussed in-session
