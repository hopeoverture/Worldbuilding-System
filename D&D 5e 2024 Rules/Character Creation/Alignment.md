# Alignment

> [!info] Quick Reference
> Alignment describes a creature's moral and ethical attitudes. In 2024, alignment is simplified and more guidance-focused, with less mechanical impact.

---

## The Alignment Grid

Alignment has two components:

### Morality (Good, Neutral, Evil)
- **Good**: Altruistic, respects life, helps others
- **Neutral**: Neither selfless nor selfish, situational ethics
- **Evil**: Selfish, cruel, willing to harm others for gain

### Ethics (Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic)
- **Lawful**: Values order, honor, tradition, keeps word
- **Neutral**: Balances personal freedom with social order
- **Chaotic**: Values freedom, flexibility, resists restriction

## The Nine Alignments

| Alignment | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Lawful Good** | Honorable protector, follows rules to do right | Paladins, noble knights |
| **Neutral Good** | Does good without bias toward law or chaos | Healers, benefactors |
| **Chaotic Good** | Values freedom to do what's right | Robin Hood figures |
| **Lawful Neutral** | Order above morality, follows codes | Judges, monks |
| **True Neutral** | Balance, or simply uninvested in ethics | Druids, detached scholars |
| **Chaotic Neutral** | Personal freedom above all | Free spirits, mercenaries |
| **Lawful Evil** | Uses rules and order for selfish ends | Tyrants, corrupt officials |
| **Neutral Evil** | Selfish without principle | Mercenaries, criminals |
| **Chaotic Evil** | Destructive, unpredictable cruelty | Demons, serial killers |

## Alignment Descriptors

### Lawful Good (LG)
The **Crusader**. Combines honor with compassion. Keeps promises, respects authority, protects the innocent. May struggle when law conflicts with good.

### Neutral Good (NG)
The **Benefactor**. Does good guided by conscience rather than rules. Helps others without worrying about order vs. freedom.

### Chaotic Good (CG)
The **Rebel**. Believes freedom is necessary for good to flourish. Distrusts authority, acts on personal conscience.

### Lawful Neutral (LN)
The **Judge**. Values order, tradition, and personal codes above outcomes. Reliable but potentially inflexible.

### True Neutral (N)
The **Undecided**. May seek balance, act selfishly in moderation, or simply avoid strong ethical stances.

### Chaotic Neutral (CN)
The **Free Spirit**. Values personal freedom and follows whims. Unpredictable but not malicious.

### Lawful Evil (LE)
The **Dominator**. Uses society's rules to get what they want. Keeps word when it benefits them.

### Neutral Evil (NE)
The **Malefactor**. Does whatever they can get away with. No loyalties except to self.

### Chaotic Evil (CE)
The **Destroyer**. Acts on violent impulses, resents restrictions. Unpredictably dangerous.

## Alignment in Play

### For Player Characters
- Alignment is a **roleplaying guide**, not a straitjacket
- Characters can act against type occasionally
- Alignment can change through play and character growth
- No mechanical penalties for alignment in 2024 rules

### Detection and Interaction
- Some spells detect alignment (*Detect Evil and Good* detects creature types, not alignment)
- Very few effects reference alignment directly
- Alignment is more relevant for NPCs and monsters

### Unaligned Creatures
Some creatures (beasts, constructs) are **Unaligned**—they don't have the capacity for moral judgment.

## Alignment Changes

Characters may shift alignment through:
- **Gradual Change**: Consistent actions in a new direction
- **Pivotal Moments**: Traumatic events or revelations
- **Divine Intervention**: Curses, blessings, or direct deity action
- **Magical Effects**: Certain rare effects force alignment change

DMs should discuss alignment changes with players rather than imposing them.

## 2024 Rules Changes

The 2024 edition de-emphasizes alignment:
- No species has a "typical" alignment assigned
- Fewer mechanical effects tied to alignment
- More focus on personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws
- Alignment is fully optional for player characters

## Tips for Using Alignment

1. **Start simple**: Pick what feels right and adjust
2. **Internal consistency**: Your character should usually act in character
3. **Allow growth**: Alignment isn't static
4. **Don't use it as an excuse**: "My character is Chaotic Neutral" doesn't justify disrupting play
5. **Consider motivations**: Why does your character do good/evil, follow/break rules?
