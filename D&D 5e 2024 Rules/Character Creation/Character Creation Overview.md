> In the 2024 rules, character creation follows a new order: Class → Origin (Background + Species) → Ability Scores → Equipment → Details.

## Character Creation Steps

### Step 1: Choose a Class

Your class is the most defining choice, determining:
- Hit Dice and hit points
- Proficiencies (armor, weapons, saves, skills)
- Starting equipment options
- Class features and subclass
- Spellcasting ability (if applicable)

**Classes**: [[Barbarian]], [[Bard]], [[Cleric]], [[Druid]], [[Fighter]], [[Monk]], [[Paladin]], [[Ranger]], [[Rogue]], [[Sorcerer]], [[Warlock]], [[Wizard]]

### Step 2: Determine Your Origin

Origin combines your **Background** and **Species**.

#### Background
Provides:
- Three ability score increases (+2/+1/+1 or +1/+1/+1/+1)
- Skill proficiencies (2)
- Tool proficiency (1)
- Starting equipment
- An Origin Feat

See [[Backgrounds]] for all 16 options.

#### Species
Provides:
- Creature type
- Size
- Speed
- Special traits and abilities
- Lifespan information

See [[Species Overview]] for all 10 options.

### Step 3: Determine Ability Scores

Two methods:

#### Standard Array
Assign these six numbers: **15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8**

#### Point Buy (27 Points)

| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| 8 | 0 | 12 | 4 |
| 9 | 1 | 13 | 5 |
| 10 | 2 | 14 | 7 |
| 11 | 3 | 15 | 9 |

After assigning base scores, apply your Background's ability score increases.

### Step 4: Choose Equipment

You can either:
- Take the starting equipment from your class and background, OR
- Take the starting gold for your class and buy equipment

| Class | Starting Gold |
|-------|---------------|
| Barbarian | 75 GP |
| Bard | 100 GP |
| Cleric | 110 GP |
| Druid | 50 GP |
| Fighter | 150 GP |
| Monk | 15 GP |
| Paladin | 150 GP |
| Ranger | 100 GP |
| Rogue | 100 GP |
| Sorcerer | 50 GP |
| Warlock | 100 GP |
| Wizard | 55 GP |

### Step 5: Fill in Details

Complete your character with:
- **Name**: Choose something fitting
- **Alignment**: Your moral and ethical outlook (optional in 2024)
- **Languages**: Common + 1 from background
- **Personality**: Traits, ideals, bonds, flaws
- **Appearance**: Physical description
- **Backstory**: History and motivations

## Starting at Higher Levels

The 2024 PHB includes guidance for creating characters above level 1:

| 5-10 | Normal + 500 GP + 1d10 × 25 GP, one uncommon magic item |

## Multiclassing

When taking a level in a new class:
- Must meet ability score prerequisites for both classes

| Class | Prerequisite |
|-------|-------------|

| Bard | CHA 13 |
| Cleric | WIS 13 |
| Druid | WIS 13 |
| Fighter | STR or DEX 13 |

| Rogue | DEX 13 |
| Sorcerer | CHA 13 |
