## Racial Traits

### Draconic Ancestry
Choose one of the dragon types from the table below. Your choice determines your breath weapon and damage resistance.

| Dragon | Damage Type | Breath Shape |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Black | Acid | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Blue | Lightning | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Brass | Fire | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Bronze | Lightning | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Copper | Acid | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Gold | Fire | 15 ft. cone |
| Green | Poison | 15 ft. cone |
| Red | Fire | 15 ft. cone |
| Silver | Cold | 15 ft. cone |
| White | Cold | 15 ft. cone |

### Breath Weapon
When you take the **Attack action** on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a breath weapon:
- **Area**: Per ancestry (30-foot line or 15-foot cone)
- **Damage**: 1d10 of your ancestry type
- **Save**: Dexterity (DC = 8 + CON modifier + Proficiency Bonus)
- Half damage on successful save

**Damage increases**: 2d10 at 5th level, 3d10 at 11th level, 4d10 at 17th level.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your **Proficiency Bonus**, regaining all uses on a **Long Rest**.

### Damage Resistance
You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry.

### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

| Blue | Lightning | Moderate resistance |
| Brass | Fire | Common resistance |
| Bronze | Lightning | Moderate resistance |
| Copper | Acid | Few creatures resist |

### Cone Breath (15 ft. cone)

|------|--------|--------------|
| Gold | Fire | Common resistance |

## Class Synergies

| Class | Synergy |
|-------|---------|
| **Paladin** | STR-based; CON for breath DC; melee + AoE |
| **Fighter** | Breath replaces one attack in Attack action |
| **Barbarian** | CON focus; breath useful when raging |
| **Sorcerer (Draconic)** | Thematic; resistance stacks conceptually |
| **Warlock** | CHA-based; breath adds AoE options |

## Combat Tips

- **Breath Weapon replaces an attack**, so Extra Attack classes use it efficiently
- Position to hit multiple targets—breath is an area effect
- **Line breath**: Works well in dungeons and corridors
- **Cone breath**: Excellent against clustered enemies
- Save breath weapon uses for when you can hit 2+ enemies
- Resistance helps you survive damage of your type
