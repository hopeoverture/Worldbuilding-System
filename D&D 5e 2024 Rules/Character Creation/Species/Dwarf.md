You can see in dim light within **120 feet** as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

*Note: 120-foot Darkvision is exceptional—most species only have 60 feet.*

### Dwarven Resilience
You have resistance to **Poison** damage. You also have **Advantage** on saving throws to avoid or end the **Poisoned** condition.

### Dwarven Toughness
Your hit point maximum increases by **1**, and it increases by **1** every time you gain a level.

### Stonecunning
As a **Bonus Action**, you gain **Tremorsense** with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes. You must be on a stone surface or touching a stone surface to use this ability.

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a **Short or Long Rest**. You can also use this trait by expending a spell slot of any level.
