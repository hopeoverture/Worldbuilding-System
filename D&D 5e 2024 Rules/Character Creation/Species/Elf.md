## Trait Analysis

### Fey Ancestry
- Charmed is a common and dangerous condition
- Many monsters charm (vampires, fey, hags, succubi)
- Advantage on saves is significant protection

### Trance
- 4-hour rest instead of 8 hours
- Conscious during rest (can watch while others sleep)
- Great for watch duty—whole party can rest while you're alert
- You still only benefit from one Long Rest per 24 hours

### Keen Senses
- Free Perception proficiency
- Perception is the most commonly used skill
- Stacks with high Wisdom for excellent passive Perception

## Roleplaying an Elf

### Physical Appearance
- Slender and graceful build
- Pointed ears
- Often ethereal or otherworldly beauty
- Features may reflect lineage (pale/silvery for Drow, etc.)

### Personality Considerations
- Long lifespan gives different perspective on time
- May seem patient or distant to shorter-lived species
- Could value art, nature, or arcane knowledge
- Might have memories spanning centuries

### Background Ideas
- Emissary from an elven nation
- Scholar who has studied for centuries
- Outcast from elven society
- Recently emerged from the Feywild, adjusting to material plane
