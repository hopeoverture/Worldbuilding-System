### Rock Gnome

**Artificer's Lore**: Whenever you make a History check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your Proficiency Bonus instead of any Proficiency Bonus you normally apply.

## Trait Analysis

### Gnomish Cunning
This is one of the strongest defensive traits in the game:
- Advantage on INT saves (mind flayers, feeblemind)
- Advantage on WIS saves (charm, fear, most spells)
- Advantage on CHA saves (banishment, some fear effects)

Most save-or-suck spells target these abilities. Gnomes are exceptionally resistant to mental manipulation.

### Size: Small
- Can move through larger creatures' spaces
- Can fit in smaller areas
- No penalties to weapon use in 2024 (small creatures can use heavy weapons)
- Speed is 30 feet (changed from 25 feet in 2014)

### Lineage Comparison

| Feature | Forest Gnome | Rock Gnome |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Cantrips | Minor Illusion | Mending, Prestidigitation |
| Special | Speak with Small Beasts | Artificer's Lore (double proficiency) |
| Best For | Illusion-focused, nature | Crafting, investigation, utility |

## Class Synergies

| Class | Synergy |
|-------|---------|
| **Wizard** | INT-based; Gnomish Cunning protects concentration; cantrips match theme |
| **Artificer** | Rock Gnome's Artificer's Lore; INT-based; inventor theme |
| **Rogue** | Small size for hiding; Arcane Trickster synergy with Forest Gnome |
| **Ranger** | Forest Gnome's speak with beasts; nature theme |
| **Bard** | Gnomish Cunning protects social character; Minor Illusion useful |

## Combat Tips

- **Gnomish Cunning** makes you incredibly resistant to crowd control—stay near the front
- Use your **size** to take cover behind Medium allies
- **Minor Illusion** (Forest) can create distractions or fake cover
- **Mending** (Rock) repairs equipment between fights
- You're an excellent choice for classes with low saving throw protection

---

## Optimization Notes

- Gnomish Cunning is arguably the best defensive species trait
- INT-based classes benefit most from the racial cantrips
- Great for any character who fears save-or-suck effects
- Consider for fragile characters (Wizard, Sorcerer) who need save protection
