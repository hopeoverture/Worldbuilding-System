## Racial Traits

### Brave
You have **Advantage** on saving throws to avoid or end the **Frightened** condition.

### Halfling Nimbleness
You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you (Medium or larger).

### Lucky
When you roll a **1** on a d20 for a D20 Test, you can reroll the die, and you must use the new roll.

### Naturally Stealthy
You can take the **Hide** action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you (Medium or larger).

## Trait Analysis

### Lucky
One of the most consistently useful traits in the game:
- Rerolls natural 1s on all d20 tests (attacks, saves, checks)
- Natural 1s occur on 5% of rolls
- Eliminates critical misses on attack rolls
- Turns worst-case scenarios into second chances

**Math Impact**: Effectively improves your average d20 roll by about 0.5, and more importantly removes the auto-fail situations.

### Brave
- Frightened is a debilitating condition
- Many monsters cause fear (dragons, undead, fiends)
- Advantage makes it much easier to resist or break free

### Halfling Nimbleness
- Move through any Medium+ creature's space
- Excellent for repositioning in combat
- Escape grapples by simply walking away (if you can move)
- Ignore allies blocking your path

### Naturally Stealthy
- Hide behind Medium+ creatures (including allies!)
- Allows hiding in combat without full cover
- Synergizes with Rogue's Sneak Attack
- Can maintain stealth while party fights openly
