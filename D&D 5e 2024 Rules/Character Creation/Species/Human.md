# Human

> [!info] Quick Reference
> Humans are the most versatile species, gaining an extra Origin Feat, skill proficiency, and daily Heroic Inspiration. They excel at any class and build.

---

## Basic Traits

| Trait | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Creature Type** | Humanoid |
| **Size** | Medium (varies widely) |
| **Speed** | 30 feet |
| **Lifespan** | ~80 years |

---

## Racial Traits

### Resourceful
You gain **Heroic Inspiration** whenever you finish a **Long Rest**.

*Heroic Inspiration allows you to reroll any d20 immediately after rolling. You can only have one Heroic Inspiration at a time.*

### Skillful
You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

### Versatile
You gain an **Origin Feat** of your choice.

*This is in addition to the Origin Feat from your background, giving humans two Origin Feats at 1st level.*

---

## Trait Analysis

### Resourceful (Daily Heroic Inspiration)
- Guaranteed reroll every day
- Use it when you really need to succeed
- Good for critical saves, important checks, or clutch attacks
- Value increases the more high-stakes situations you face

### Skillful (Extra Skill)
- One additional skill proficiency
- Can round out your capabilities
- Take a skill your class doesn't offer
- Great for skill-monkey builds

### Versatile (Extra Origin Feat)
This is the signature human trait. Two Origin Feats at level 1 means:
- More powerful at 1st level than other species
- Greater build customization
- Can take synergistic feat combinations

---

## Origin Feat Recommendations

Since humans get TWO Origin Feats (one from background, one from Versatile), here are strong combinations:

### For Martial Characters
| First Feat | Second Feat | Strategy |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Alert | Savage Attacker | Act first, hit harder |
| Tavern Brawler | Tough | Grappling tank |
| Magic Initiate | Alert | Utility + initiative |

### For Spellcasters
| First Feat | Second Feat | Strategy |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Magic Initiate (Cleric) | Magic Initiate (Wizard) | More cantrips/spells |
| Lucky | Alert | Control initiative, protect saves |
| Healer | Magic Initiate | Support focus |

### Universal Good Choices
- **Alert**: +5 initiative, can't be surprised
- **Lucky**: Reroll dice (stacks well with Resourceful)
- **Skilled**: +3 skill proficiencies
- **Tough**: +2 HP per level

## Roleplaying a Human

### Physical Appearance
- Highly variable—any ethnicity, build, or features
- No inherent magical traits visible
- Most physically diverse species

### Personality Considerations
- Often ambitious and driven
- Shorter lifespan creates urgency
- May be curious about longer-lived species
- Adaptable to any culture or situation

### Background Ideas
- Literally any background works
- The "blank slate" species for any concept
- Can be from any culture or region
- Easy to integrate into any campaign world

## Class Synergies

Humans work well with **every class** due to:
- Extra feat allowing build optimization
- Skill proficiency filling gaps
- Heroic Inspiration benefiting all d20 tests

| Class | Recommended Feats |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Fighter** | Alert, Savage Attacker, Tough |
| **Wizard** | Alert, Magic Initiate, Lucky |
| **Rogue** | Alert, Skilled, Lucky |
| **Cleric** | Healer, Magic Initiate, Tough |
| **Paladin** | Tough, Savage Attacker, Alert |

---

## Combat Tips

- Save **Heroic Inspiration** for high-stakes moments (death saves, crucial attacks)
- Your extra feat gives you an edge at low levels—leverage it
- The extra skill helps in exploration and social encounters
- You have no special defenses—position carefully

---

## Optimization Notes

### Why Play Human?
- Best for min-maxing builds (extra feat = earlier power spikes)
- Great for multiclass prerequisites (feat bonuses)
- No wasted traits—everything is useful
- Simplest to build and play

### Human vs. Other Species
Other species offer unique abilities (darkvision, resistances, etc.) but humans offer:
- Raw power through feats
- Flexibility through skill
- Consistency through daily inspiration

### When to Pick Human
- You want a specific feat combo at level 1
- Your build doesn't synergize with a specific species
- You want maximum character customization
- You value simplicity and reliability
