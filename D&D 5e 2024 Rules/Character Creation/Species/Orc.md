## Racial Traits

### Adrenaline Rush
You can take the **Dash** action as a **Bonus Action**. When you do so, you gain a number of **Temporary Hit Points** equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your **Proficiency Bonus**, regaining all uses on a **Short or Long Rest**.

### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within **120 feet** as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

### Relentless Endurance
When you are reduced to **0 hit points** but not killed outright, you can drop to **1 hit point** instead.

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a **Long Rest**.
