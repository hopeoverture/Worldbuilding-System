## Choosing a Species

Consider:
- **Concept**: What species fits your character idea?
- **Traits**: Which abilities complement your class?
- **Roleplay**: What culture and history interest you?
- **Party Composition**: Variety can be fun

Species choice matters less mechanically in 2024 since ability scores come from Background, so choose what excites you!
