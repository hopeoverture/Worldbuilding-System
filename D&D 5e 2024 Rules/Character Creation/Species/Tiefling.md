## Legacy Comparison

### Resistance Value

## Trait Analysis

### Thaumaturgy
Free cantrip that provides:
- Minor sensory effects
- Voice amplification (3× volume)
- Door/window manipulation
- Eye appearance changes
- Great for intimidation and dramatic moments

### Fiendish Legacy Spells
- Cast once per Long Rest **without a spell slot**
- Can also cast using spell slots if you have them
- CHA-based, so benefits CHA classes
- Scales with level (Poison Spray damage increases)

## Roleplaying a Tiefling

### Physical Appearance
- Horns (various shapes and sizes)
- Solid-colored eyes (often red, gold, silver, or black)
- Skin ranging from human tones to red, blue, or purple
- May have a tail, unusual teeth, or other fiendish features
- Appearance can reflect specific legacy

### Personality Considerations
- May face prejudice due to fiendish appearance
- Could embrace, reject, or be conflicted about heritage
- Might feel connection to (or revulsion toward) fiendish entities
- Often independent and self-reliant

### Background Ideas
- Escaped cultist who rejected dark powers
- Diplomat using exotic appearance to their advantage
- Wanderer never accepted by any community
- Scholar studying fiendish lore to understand themselves

## Class Synergies

| Class | Legacy | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Warlock** | Any | CHA-based; fiendish theme; free spells save slots |
| **Sorcerer** | Infernal | CHA-based; Hellish Rebuke as reaction |
| **Bard** | Chthonic | CHA-based; False Life extends HP |
| **Paladin** | Infernal | CHA-based; fire resistance vs. demons |
| **Rogue** | Infernal | Darkness for hiding; Hellish Rebuke punishes attackers |

---

## Combat Tips

- **Infernal**: Hellish Rebuke punishes enemies who hit you—save for big hits
- **Chthonic**: Cast False Life before combat for temp HP buffer
- **Abyssal**: Poison Spray is strong at low levels; use Ray of Sickness for debuff
- **Thaumaturgy**: Create distractions, intimidate, or signal allies
- Fire/Necrotic/Poison resistance lets you wade into appropriate hazards

---

## Build Considerations

### Infernal (Most Popular)
- Fire is the most common elemental damage
- Hellish Rebuke is excellent for squishy characters
- Darkness combo with Devil's Sight (Warlock)
- Classic "devilish" aesthetic

### Chthonic (Defensive)
- False Life provides consistent durability
- Ray of Enfeeblement nerfs enemy damage
- Necrotic resistance helps against undead
- Good for characters who expect to get hit

### Abyssal (Offensive)
- Poison Spray scales well (d12 damage)
- Ray of Sickness adds Poisoned condition
- Poison resistance is common but useful
- More aggressive, toxin-focused theme
