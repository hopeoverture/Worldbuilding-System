## Key Features

### Rage
**Bonus Action** to enter rage (lasts 10 minutes or until ended):
- **Advantage** on Strength checks and saves
- **Bonus damage** on melee attacks using Strength (see table)
- **Resistance** to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage
- Cannot cast or concentrate on spells

Rage ends early if you don't attack or take damage, or if you choose to end it.

### Unarmored Defense
While not wearing armor: **AC = 10 + DEX modifier + CON modifier** (can use shield)

### Reckless Attack
When you make your first attack on your turn, you can attack recklessly:
- **Advantage** on all melee attack rolls using Strength this turn
- All attack rolls against you have **Advantage** until your next turn

### Danger Sense
**Advantage** on Dexterity saving throws against effects you can see (traps, spells, etc.). Doesn't work if Blinded, Deafened, or Incapacitated.

### Extra Attack (5th Level)
Attack twice when you take the Attack action.

### Fast Movement (5th Level)
Speed increases by **10 feet** while not wearing heavy armor.

### Feral Instinct (7th Level)
**Advantage** on Initiative. If surprised, you can act normally if you enter Rage first.

### Brutal Strike (9th Level)
Once per turn when you hit with Reckless Attack and deal damage, you can choose one:
- **Forceful Blow**: Push target 15 ft. away
- **Hamstring Blow**: Reduce target's speed by 15 ft. until your next turn

### Relentless Rage (11th Level)
If you drop to 0 HP while raging, make DC 10 CON save. Success: drop to 1 HP instead. DC increases by 5 each use, resets on Short/Long Rest.

### Persistent Rage (15th Level)
Rage only ends early if you fall Unconscious or choose to end it.

### Primal Champion (20th Level)
STR and CON increase by 4 (max 25). Unlimited Rages.
