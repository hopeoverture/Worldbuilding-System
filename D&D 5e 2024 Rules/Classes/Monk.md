## Key Features

### Martial Arts
While not wearing armor or shield and using Monk Weapons or Unarmed Strikes:
- Use DEX instead of STR for attack/damage
- Roll Martial Arts die for Unarmed Strike damage (scales with level)
- **Bonus Action**: Make one Unarmed Strike

### Unarmored Defense
**AC = 10 + DEX modifier + WIS modifier**

### Monk's Focus (Ki)
Spend Ki points for special abilities:
- **Flurry of Blows** (1 Ki): After Attack action, make 2 Unarmed Strikes as Bonus Action
- **Patient Defense** (1 Ki): Bonus Action Dodge + Disengage
- **Step of the Wind** (1 Ki): Bonus Action Dash, jump distance doubled

Ki points = Monk level. Regain all on **Short or Long Rest**.

### Uncanny Metabolism (2nd Level)
When you roll Initiative:
- Regain all Ki points if you have none
- Heal 1 roll of Martial Arts die + Monk level HP

### Deflect Attacks (3rd Level)
**Reaction** when hit by attack: Reduce damage by 1d10 + DEX + Monk level.
- If reduced to 0 and it's melee, spend 1 Ki to Unarmed Strike the attacker

### Stunning Strike (5th Level)
When you hit with Unarmed Strike, spend 1 Ki: Target makes CON save or is **Stunned** until your next turn.

### Empowered Strikes (6th Level)
Unarmed Strikes count as magical.

### Evasion (7th Level)
DEX saves for half damage → take none on success, half on fail.

### Acrobatic Movement (9th Level)
While unarmored: Climb and walk on liquids without falling.

### Heightened Focus (10th Level)
**Flurry of Blows** now grants 3 attacks.

### Deflect Energy (13th Level)
Deflect Attacks works against ranged spell attacks too.

### Superior Defense (18th Level)
At start of turn, spend 3 Ki to gain resistance to all damage except Force for 1 minute.

### Body and Mind (20th Level)
DEX and WIS increase by 4 (max 25).
