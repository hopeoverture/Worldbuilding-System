# Ability Scores

> [!info] Quick Reference
> Six abilities define a creature's physical and mental characteristics. Each ability has a score (typically 1-20) and a modifier derived from that score.

## The Six Abilities

| Ability | Abbr. | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Strength** | STR | Physical power, athletic training, raw physical force |
| **Dexterity** | DEX | Agility, reflexes, balance, coordination |
| **Constitution** | CON | Health, stamina, vital force, endurance |
| **Intelligence** | INT | Mental acuity, information recall, analytical skill |
| **Wisdom** | WIS | Awareness, intuition, insight, perception |
| **Charisma** | CHA | Confidence, eloquence, leadership, force of personality |

## Ability Modifiers

The modifier is derived from the ability score using this formula:
**Modifier = (Score - 10) ÷ 2** (round down)

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | -5 | 12-13 | +1 |
| 2-3 | -4 | 14-15 | +2 |
| 4-5 | -3 | 16-17 | +3 |
| 6-7 | -2 | 18-19 | +4 |
| 8-9 | -1 | 20-21 | +5 |
| 10-11 | +0 | 22-23 | +6 |

Scores can exceed 20 for monsters and through magical means. The maximum for player characters is typically 20 unless a feature states otherwise.

## Using Ability Scores

Ability scores and modifiers are used in three main types of **D20 Tests**:

1. **Ability Checks** - Using an ability to overcome a challenge
2. **Attack Rolls** - Attempting to hit a target with a weapon or spell
3. **Saving Throws** - Resisting a threat or effect

### Ability Checks

When you attempt something with an uncertain outcome, the DM calls for an ability check:
1. Roll 1d20
2. Add the relevant ability modifier
3. Add Proficiency Bonus if proficient in a relevant skill
4. Compare to the Difficulty Class (DC)

### Skills

Each ability has associated skills that represent focused training:

| Ability | Associated Skills |
|---------|------------------|
| Strength | Athletics |
| Dexterity | Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth |
| Constitution | *(No skills)* |
| Intelligence | Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion |
| Wisdom | Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival |
| Charisma | Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion |

### Passive Scores

A passive score represents the average result for a task done repeatedly or when not actively trying:
**Passive Score = 10 + all modifiers that apply**

Common passive scores:
- **Passive Perception** - General awareness
- **Passive Insight** - Detecting lies or hidden motives
- **Passive Investigation** - Noticing details
