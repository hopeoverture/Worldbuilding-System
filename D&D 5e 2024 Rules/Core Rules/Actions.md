### Dash
Gain extra movement equal to your Speed for this turn.
- Stacks with your normal movement
- Affected by difficult terrain normally

### Disengage
Your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.
- Useful for retreating safely
- Some features grant this as a Bonus Action

### Dodge
Until your next turn:
- Attack rolls against you have **Disadvantage** (if you can see the attacker)
- You have **Advantage** on Dexterity saving throws

### Help
Assist an ally:
- **Ability Check**: Give advantage on one ally's next ability check for a specific task (must be made before your next turn)
- **Attack Roll**: Give advantage on one ally's next attack roll against a creature within 5 feet of you (must be made before your next turn)

### Hide
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to become Hidden.
- Must have cover or be heavily obscured
- DC is typically the Passive Perception of creatures looking for you
- Success: You are Hidden until you make noise, attack, cast a spell, or are discovered

### Influence

- Spells with casting time of "1 action" use this
- Different from Attack action (can't be replaced with Extra Attack)

### Ready
Prepare to act in response to a trigger:
1. Describe the trigger ("When the goblin opens the door...")
2. Choose the action you'll take (or movement up to your speed)
3. When trigger occurs, use your **Reaction** to take the action
- Readied spells require Concentration and use the spell slot even if not triggered

Common sources:

- **Spells**: Many spells have "1 bonus action" casting time
- **Class Features**: Barbarian Rage, Monk Ki abilities, etc.

### Opportunity Attack
When a hostile creature you can see moves out of your reach:

- Interrupts the triggering movement
- Doesn't occur if creature uses Disengage or is teleported

### Readied Action
Trigger a prepared action (see Ready above).

### Spell Reactions
Some spells like *Shield* or *Counterspell* are cast as Reactions.
