# Combat

> [!info] Quick Reference
> Combat is played in rounds. Each round represents 6 seconds of game time. Every participant takes one turn per round in initiative order.

## Combat Sequence

1. **Determine Surprise** (if applicable)
2. **Establish Positions** - DM describes locations
3. **Roll Initiative** - Determines turn order
4. **Take Turns** - In initiative order
5. **Repeat** - New round begins after everyone has acted

---

## Initiative

At the start of combat, each participant rolls initiative:
**d20 + Dexterity modifier**

- Higher totals act first
- Ties: DM decides for monsters; players decide among themselves
- Initiative order remains the same each round unless something changes it

### Surprise

If one side is unaware of the other:
- Surprised creatures can't move, take actions, bonus actions, or reactions on their first turn
- A creature stops being surprised at the end of its first turn
