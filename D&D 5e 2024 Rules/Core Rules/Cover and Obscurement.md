# Cover and Obscurement

> [!info] Quick Reference
> Cover provides protection from attacks and effects. Obscurement affects vision and perception. Both significantly impact combat tactics.

---

## Cover

Cover is physical protection between you and an attack or effect.

### Degrees of Cover

| Cover Type | AC/DEX Save Bonus | Description |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Half Cover** | +2 | Obstacle blocks at least half your body (low wall, furniture, another creature) |
| **Three-Quarters Cover** | +5 | Obstacle blocks about three-quarters of your body (portcullis, arrow slit, thick tree) |
| **Total Cover** | Can't be targeted | Completely concealed by obstacle |

### Cover Rules

- **Determining Cover**: Draw imaginary lines from any corner of the attacker's space to every corner of the target's space. If any line passes through an obstacle, the target has cover.

- **Creature Cover**: Other creatures can provide half cover. This includes both allies and enemies.

- **Behind vs. In**: Being behind cover grants its benefits. Being in an arrow slit or behind a crenel provides cover from that direction.

- **Total Cover and Targeting**: You can't directly target a creature with total cover with attacks or most spells. Area effects might still reach them.

### Cover and Saving Throws

Cover bonuses apply to Dexterity saving throws against effects you can see, such as:
- Fireball
- Lightning Bolt
- Breath weapons
- Dragon's breath

## Obscurement

Obscurement affects how well you can see an area or creature.

### Degrees of Obscurement

| Type | Vision Effect | Examples |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Lightly Obscured** | Disadvantage on Perception checks relying on sight | Dim light, patchy fog, moderate foliage |
| **Heavily Obscured** | Effectively Blinded when trying to see something there | Darkness, opaque fog, dense foliage |

### Effects of Being Heavily Obscured

When you can't see a target (they're in heavily obscured area or you're Blinded):
- You have **Disadvantage** on attack rolls against them
- They have **Advantage** on attack rolls against you
- You can't target them with spells that require you to see the target

## Light and Vision

### Light Levels

| Light Level | Obscurement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Bright Light** | None | Normal daylight, torches within radius, light spells |
| **Dim Light** | Lightly Obscured | Shadows, twilight, torch at edge of radius |
| **Darkness** | Heavily Obscured | Unlit dungeons, nighttime without moonlight |

### Special Vision Types

#### Darkvision
- See in dim light as if bright light (within specified range)
- See in darkness as if dim light (within specified range)
- Can't discern color in darkness—only shades of gray

#### Blindsight
- Perceive surroundings without relying on sight (within specified range)
- Unaffected by Blinded condition within range
- Can perceive Invisible creatures

#### Tremorsense
- Detect creatures and moving objects in contact with the same surface
- Cannot detect flying or incorporeal creatures

#### Truesight
- See in normal and magical darkness
- See Invisible creatures and objects
- Automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saves against them
- Perceive a shapechanger's original form
- See into the Ethereal Plane

## Hiding and Stealth

### Requirements to Hide
- Must have cover or be heavily obscured from creatures you're hiding from
- Make Dexterity (Stealth) check

### What Breaks Hiding
- Making noise (combat, yelling)
- Coming out of cover or heavy obscurement
- Being spotted (enemy beats your Stealth with Perception)
- Attacking (though you might get advantage on the first attack)
- Casting a spell with verbal components

### Unseen Attackers

**If you are unseen by your target**:
- You have **Advantage** on the attack roll
- Your location is revealed when you attack (hit or miss)

**If your target is unseen by you**:
- You have **Disadvantage** on the attack roll
- Must guess the target's location
- If wrong: Attack automatically misses, but DM doesn't reveal whether you guessed correctly

---

## Invisibility

Being Invisible doesn't mean you're hidden—you can still be:
- Heard (footsteps, breathing, voice)
- Tracked (footprints, disturbances)
- Detected by Blindsight or Truesight

### Benefits of Invisibility
- Heavily obscured (can't be seen)
- Advantage on attack rolls
- Attack rolls against you have Disadvantage

### Still Need to Hide
To be truly undetectable, an Invisible creature should still take the Hide action if it wants to avoid being heard or tracked.

## Practical Scenarios

| Scenario | Attacker Status | Attack Roll |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Attacker hidden, target unaware | Advantage | Normal damage |
| Attacker visible, target behind half cover | Normal | Target +2 AC |
| Attacker in dim light, target in bright light | Normal (both can see) | Normal |
| Attacker in bright light, target in darkness | Disadvantage | Target has Advantage |
| Both in darkness (neither has Darkvision) | Cancel out | Normal |
| Attacker has Darkvision, target in darkness | Normal | Advantage |
