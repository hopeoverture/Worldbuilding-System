# D20 Tests

> [!info] Quick Reference
> D20 Tests are the three main dice rolls in the game: Ability Checks, Attack Rolls, and Saving Throws. All follow the same basic formula: d20 + modifiers vs. a target number.

## The Basic Formula

**d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if applicable) + Other Bonuses**

Compare the total to a target number:
- **Difficulty Class (DC)** for Ability Checks and Saving Throws
- **Armor Class (AC)** for Attack Rolls

**Meet or beat = Success**

## Ability Checks

Used when attempting tasks with uncertain outcomes.

### Process
1. DM determines the ability and (optionally) a skill
2. DM sets a Difficulty Class
3. Player rolls d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus (if proficient in the skill)
4. Equal to or higher than DC = success

### Difficulty Classes

| Task Difficulty | DC |
|----------------|-----|
| Very Easy | 5 |
| Easy | 10 |
| Medium | 15 |
| Hard | 20 |
| Very Hard | 25 |
| Nearly Impossible | 30 |

### Contests

When two creatures compete, both make ability checks. The higher total wins. Ties go to the creature being challenged (the defender or status quo holder).

## Attack Rolls

Used when attempting to hit a creature or object with a weapon or spell.

### Process
1. Roll d20
2. Add ability modifier (STR or DEX for weapons, spellcasting ability for spells)
3. Add Proficiency Bonus if proficient with the weapon
4. Compare to target's Armor Class
5. Equal to or higher = hit

### Critical Hits and Misses

- **Natural 20**: Automatic hit, roll damage dice twice (critical hit)
- **Natural 1**: Automatic miss, regardless of modifiers

## Saving Throws

Used to resist spells, traps, poisons, and other threats.

### Process
1. Roll d20
2. Add the relevant ability modifier
3. Add Proficiency Bonus if proficient in that save
4. Compare to the effect's DC
5. Equal to or higher = success (often reduced or no effect)

### Save Proficiencies

Each class grants proficiency in two saving throws. Common pairings:
- **Strong saves**: Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom
- **Weak saves**: Strength, Intelligence, Charisma

## Advantage and Disadvantage

### Advantage
Roll two d20s, use the **higher** result.
- Granted by beneficial circumstances, spells, or features
- Examples: Attacking an unseen target, Help action, certain spells

### Disadvantage
Roll two d20s, use the **lower** result.
- Caused by hindering circumstances
- Examples: Attacking while blinded, long range attacks, certain conditions

### Stacking Rules

- Multiple sources of advantage = still just advantage (roll 2d20, take higher)
- Multiple sources of disadvantage = still just disadvantage (roll 2d20, take lower)
- **Any advantage + any disadvantage = cancel out** (roll normally)
  - This applies regardless of how many sources of each

## Proficiency Bonus

Your Proficiency Bonus is determined by your total character level:

| Level | Bonus | Level | Bonus |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1-4 | +2 | 13-16 | +5 |
| 5-8 | +3 | 17-20 | +6 |
| 9-12 | +4 | | |

You add this bonus when you have proficiency in:
- A skill being used for an ability check
- A saving throw
- A weapon or spell being used to attack
- A tool being used

### Expertise

Some features grant Expertise, which doubles your Proficiency Bonus for specific checks.
