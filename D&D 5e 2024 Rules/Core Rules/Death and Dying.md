# Death and Dying

When an adventurer's hit points drop to 0, they fall unconscious or die outright. This document covers the rules for what happens when characters face death.

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious.

### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

**Example:** A character with a maximum of 12 hit points has 6 hit points currently. If they take 18 damage, they are reduced to 0 hit points with 12 damage remaining. Because the remaining damage equals their hit point maximum, the character dies instantly.

### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you have the **Unconscious** condition and begin making **Death Saving Throws**.

## Death Saving Throws

When you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw called a Death Saving Throw.

### Making the Roll
Roll a d20. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now.

| d20 Roll | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Two Death Save failures |
| 2-9 | One Death Save failure |
| 10-19 | One Death Save success |
| 20 | Regain 1 HP, you're conscious |

### Success and Failure
- **Three Successes:** You become stable (see Stabilizing below)
- **Three Failures:** You die

Successes and failures don't need to be consecutive. Keep track of both until you collect three of either.

### Rolling 1 or 20
- **Natural 1:** Counts as two failures
- **Natural 20:** You regain 1 hit point and regain consciousness

### Effects That Reset
When you regain any hit points, both your Death Save successes and failures reset to zero.

## Damage at 0 Hit Points

If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a Death Save failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you die instantly.

## Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized.

### Using Medicine
You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

### Stable Creatures
A stable creature:
- Doesn't make Death Saving Throws
- Remains unconscious with 0 hit points
- Regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours

If the stable creature takes any damage, it stops being stable and must start making Death Saving Throws again.

## Healing

Any healing applied to a creature at 0 hit points:
1. Restores hit points normally
2. Ends the Unconscious condition (if caused by 0 HP)
3. Resets Death Save successes and failures

### Healing at 0 HP
A creature at 0 hit points regains hit points as normal. They immediately become conscious when they have at least 1 hit point.

## Spare the Dying

The *Spare the Dying* cantrip stabilizes a creature at 0 hit points without requiring a Medicine check.

## Death

When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaving behind a corpse.

### Reviving the Dead

Several spells can restore life to the dead:

| Spell | Level | Time Dead | Condition |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Revivify | 3rd | 1 minute | 300 gp diamond consumed |
| Raise Dead | 5th | 10 days | 500 gp diamond consumed |
| Reincarnate | 5th | 10 days | New random body |
| Resurrection | 7th | 100 years | 1,000 gp diamond consumed |
| True Resurrection | 9th | 200 years | 25,000 gp diamond consumed |
| Wish | 9th | Any time | No material cost |

### Creature Willingness
A soul must be free and willing to return. If the creature doesn't want to return, the spell fails.

## Monsters and Death

Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make Death Saving Throws. NPCs might follow the same rules as monsters, or the DM might choose to have important NPCs make Death Saving Throws.

## Knocking Creatures Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow.

**Knocking Out:** When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

## Hit Point Tracking Variants

### Death Threshold (Optional)
Instead of dying at 0 HP, characters die when they reach negative hit points equal to their Constitution score. This makes characters more durable.

### Lingering Injuries (Optional)
When reduced to 0 hit points, roll on a Lingering Injuries table to gain a lasting wound that requires magical healing to remove.

## Quick Reference

### Combat Round at 0 HP
1. **Start of Turn:** Make a Death Saving Throw
2. **If Nat 20:** Regain 1 HP, act normally
3. **If Stable:** Skip saving throw, remain unconscious
4. **If Dead:** Remove from initiative

### Saving an Ally
1. **Healing Word** (bonus action, any healing)
2. **Medicine Check** DC 10 (action, stabilizes only)
3. **Spare the Dying** (action, stabilizes only)
4. **Health Potion** (action, restores HP)
5. **Lay on Hands** (action, heals HP)

| Healing spell/potion | Varies | Restores HP, ends unconscious |
