# Heroic Inspiration

Heroic Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward a player character for bringing fun to the table or for excellent roleplaying.

## Gaining Heroic Inspiration

A player can gain Heroic Inspiration from the following sources:

### DM Awards
The DM can award Heroic Inspiration to a character at any time. Common reasons include:
- Excellent roleplaying
- Clever problem-solving
- Making the game more fun for everyone
- Acting on character flaws in interesting ways
- Achieving significant story milestones

### Rolling a Natural 1
In D&D 5e 2024, when you roll a 1 on a d20 for a D20 Test, you gain Heroic Inspiration. This replaces the feeling of failure with an opportunity for future success.

### Background Feature
Each background in the 2024 rules specifies a way for your character to gain Heroic Inspiration, typically related to your character's backstory or motivation.

## Using Heroic Inspiration

If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to give yourself **Advantage** on any D20 Test you make.

### Timing
You must decide to use Heroic Inspiration before you roll.

### One at a Time
You can have only one instance of Heroic Inspiration at a time. If you gain it while you already have it, you don't get a second use—though you can give your Heroic Inspiration to another player character who doesn't have it.

### Passing Inspiration
If you have Heroic Inspiration and gain another instance of it, you can immediately give the new instance to any other player character who lacks Heroic Inspiration. This represents shared momentum and teamwork.

## Heroic Inspiration vs. Bardic Inspiration

These are different features and stack:

| Feature | Source | Effect | Timing |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Heroic Inspiration | DM, Nat 1, Background | Advantage on D20 Test | Before roll |
| Bardic Inspiration | Bard class feature | Add die to roll | After roll, before outcome |

A character can use both on the same roll: Heroic Inspiration before rolling, then Bardic Inspiration after seeing the result.

## DM Guidance

### When to Award
- Significant character moments
- Clever solutions to problems
- Great one-liners or speeches
- Embracing character flaws
- Helping other players shine

### How Often
Award Heroic Inspiration frequently enough that players feel rewarded but rarely enough that it feels special. A guideline is 1-3 times per session per player.

### Group Variants

**Inspiration Pool:** The party shares a pool of Inspiration dice equal to the number of players. Any player can use one, and the pool refills at the start of each session.

**Table Inspiration:** When any player rolls a natural 1, any player without Heroic Inspiration gains it.

## Tracking Heroic Inspiration

Common methods:
- Physical token (coin, poker chip, special die)
- Note on character sheet
- Digital tracker
- DM notation

## Design Intent

Heroic Inspiration in 2024 rules serves to:
1. Reward good roleplaying and creativity
2. Offset the sting of rolling natural 1s
3. Create "come back" moments in dramatic situations
4. Encourage players to take risks
5. Add a resource that feels special but isn't overpowered
