# Movement

> [!info] Quick Reference
> On your turn, you can move up to your Speed in feet. Movement can be broken up before and after actions. Various terrain and conditions affect movement costs.

## Speed

**Speed** is the distance in feet you can move on your turn. Most characters have a walking speed of 30 feet.

### Special Movement Types

| Movement Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Walking Speed** | Default ground movement |
| **Burrow Speed** | Move through sand, earth, mud, or ice |
| **Climb Speed** | Move along vertical surfaces |
| **Fly Speed** | Move through the air |
| **Swim Speed** | Move through liquids |

If you have multiple speeds, choose which to use. When switching speeds, subtract distance already moved from the new speed.

## Basic Movement Rules

### Breaking Up Movement
You can split movement around actions:
- Move 10 feet → Attack → Move 20 feet (if speed is 30)

### Moving Through Other Creatures

| Creature | Can Move Through? | Can Stop? |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Ally | Yes | No (unless 2+ sizes smaller) |
| Enemy (2+ sizes different) | Yes (difficult terrain) | No |
| Enemy (within 1 size) | No | No |

Incapacitated creatures count as difficult terrain.

### Squeezing

Moving through a space one size smaller than you:
- Costs 1 extra foot per foot moved
- Attack rolls have Disadvantage
- Attack rolls against you have Advantage

---

## Difficult Terrain

Moving through difficult terrain costs **2 feet of movement per 1 foot traveled**.

Examples of difficult terrain:
- Rubble, dense vegetation
- Shallow water, mud, snow
- Stairs (at DM's discretion)
- Low furniture, small creatures' spaces

Multiple sources don't stack—difficult terrain never costs more than 2 feet per foot.

---

## Climbing

Without a Climb Speed:
- Climbing costs **2 feet of movement per 1 foot climbed**
- DM may require Strength (Athletics) check for difficult climbs

With a Climb Speed:
- Climbing costs normal movement
- No ability check normally needed

### Climbing Larger Creatures
You can climb onto a creature at least two sizes larger:
- Make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check vs. creature's Dexterity (Acrobatics)
- Success: You enter the creature's space and move with it
- Advantage on attacks against the creature
- You can be attacked as normal

---

## Swimming

Without a Swim Speed:
- Swimming costs **2 feet of movement per 1 foot swum**
- May require Strength (Athletics) checks in rough water

With a Swim Speed:
- Swimming costs normal movement
- No ability check normally needed in calm water

### Holding Breath
You can hold your breath for **1 + Constitution modifier minutes** (minimum 30 seconds).

When out of breath or choking:
- Survive for number of rounds equal to Constitution modifier (minimum 1)
- At start of next turn after that: Drop to 0 HP and dying

---

## Jumping

### Long Jump
**Running Start**: Cover distance equal to your Strength score in feet
**Standing**: Half that distance

Each foot of the jump costs 1 foot of movement.

### High Jump
**Running Start**: Jump height equal to 3 + Strength modifier feet
**Standing**: Half that distance

Your arms can reach 1.5× your height above during the jump.

### Jump Distance Limits
If jumping distance exceeds remaining movement, you stop where movement runs out (unless Jump spell or similar effect applies).

---

## Flying

Creatures with a Fly Speed can move through the air.

### Falling
If a flying creature is knocked Prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or otherwise loses the ability to move:
- It falls unless it can Hover or is held aloft by magic

### Hovering
Creatures that can Hover:
- Don't fall when speed becomes 0
- Don't fall when knocked Prone in the air

### Falling Damage
Fall damage: **1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen** (max 20d6)
- Land Prone if you take any falling damage
- You fall instantly (no time passes during a fall within a single turn)

---

## Crawling

While Prone:
- Every foot of crawling costs **1 extra foot of movement**
- Crawling in difficult terrain costs **3 feet per foot**

---

## Standing Up

Standing from Prone costs movement equal to **half your Speed**.

If your speed is 0, you can't stand up.

---

## Forced Movement

When you're moved against your will (pushed, pulled, teleported by an enemy):
- Doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks
- Doesn't use your movement
- If pushed into hazards, you may get a saving throw (DM's call)
