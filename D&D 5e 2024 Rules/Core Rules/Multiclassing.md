# Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

## Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one.

| Class | Ability Score Minimum |
|-------|----------------------|
| Barbarian | Strength 13 |
| Bard | Charisma 13 |
| Cleric | Wisdom 13 |
| Druid | Wisdom 13 |
| Fighter | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |
| Monk | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Paladin | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
| Ranger | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Rogue | Dexterity 13 |
| Sorcerer | Charisma 13 |
| Warlock | Charisma 13 |
| Wizard | Intelligence 13 |

## Experience Points and Levels

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. When you gain a level, you choose which class to gain a level in.

## Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together.

## Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level.

| Total Level | Proficiency Bonus |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-4 | +2 |
| 5-8 | +3 |
| 9-12 | +4 |
| 13-16 | +5 |
| 17-20 | +6 |

## Proficiencies Gained

When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies.

| Class | Proficiencies Gained |
|-------|---------------------|
| Barbarian | Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons |
| Bard | Light Armor, one skill, one Musical Instrument |
| Cleric | Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields |
| Druid | Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields |
| Fighter | Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons |
| Monk | Simple Weapons |
| Paladin | Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons |
| Ranger | Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons, one skill |
| Rogue | Light Armor, one skill, Thieves' Tools |
| Sorcerer | — |
| Warlock | Light Armor, Simple Weapons |
| Wizard | — |

## Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. Some features have additional rules when you're multiclassing.

### Channel Divinity

If you already have Channel Divinity and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you.

### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do.

### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

## Spellcasting

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes.

### Spells Known and Prepared

You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes.

### Spell Slots

You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the Paladin and Ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

| Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 2 | 3 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 3 | 4 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 4 | 4 | 3 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 7 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | — | — | — | — | — |
| 8 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — |
| 9 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | — | — | — | — |
| 10 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | — | — | — | — |
| 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | — | — | — |
| 12 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | — | — | — |
| 13 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | — | — |
| 14 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | — | — |
| 15 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | — |
| 16 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | — |
| 17 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 18 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 19 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 20 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

### Pact Magic

If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the Warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast Warlock spells you know.

## Common Multiclass Combinations

| Combination | Synergy | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Fighter/Wizard | Action Surge + Spells | Extra action for casting |
| Paladin/Sorcerer | Divine Smite + Slots | More spell slots for smites |
| Rogue/Fighter | Sneak Attack + Action Surge | Extra attacks for sneak attack chances |
| Barbarian/Rogue | Rage + Sneak Attack | Advantage from Reckless Attack |
| Cleric/Druid | Healing + Wild Shape | Flexible support options |
| Warlock/Sorcerer | Quickened Eldritch Blast | Metamagic on invocation-boosted cantrips |

## Multiclassing and Character Level

When a feature refers to "character level," use your total level across all classes. When it refers to "class level" or "[Class] level," use only your level in that specific class.

### Cantrip Scaling

Cantrips scale with character level, not class level. A level 5 character who is Wizard 3/Fighter 2 casts cantrips as a 5th-level character.

### Ability Score Improvements

You gain Ability Score Improvements only when you reach the appropriate level in a specific class (typically 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th).
