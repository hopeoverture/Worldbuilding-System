## Hit Dice

### What Are Hit Dice?
- Determined by your class (e.g., d10 for Fighter, d8 for Cleric)
- Number of Hit Dice equals your character level
- Each class contributes its die type if multiclassing

### Using Hit Dice
**During a Short Rest**:
1. Choose to spend one or more Hit Dice
2. Roll each die and add your Constitution modifier
3. Regain hit points equal to the total
4. Repeat as desired with remaining Hit Dice

### Recovering Hit Dice
**After a Long Rest**: Regain spent Hit Dice up to half your total (minimum 1)

*Example*: A level 8 character with 0 Hit Dice remaining would regain 4 Hit Dice after a Long Rest.
