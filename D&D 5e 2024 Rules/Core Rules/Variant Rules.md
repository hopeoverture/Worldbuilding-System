# Variant and Optional Rules

These optional rules can be used to customize your D&D experience. Discuss with your group before implementing any variants.

## Character Options

### Customizing Ability Scores

**Standard Array:** 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 (assign as desired)

**Point Buy (27 points):**

| Score | Cost |
|-------|------|
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |

**Rolling:** Roll 4d6, drop the lowest die, repeat six times.

### Feats

Feats are optional character customizations that replace Ability Score Improvements. With DM permission, when you gain an Ability Score Improvement, you can instead take a feat.

### Multiclassing

Multiclassing (detailed in its own document) allows characters to gain levels in multiple classes. This is an optional rule that requires meeting ability score prerequisites.

## Combat Variants

### Flanking (Optional)

When a creature and at least one ally are on opposite sides of an enemy and within 5 feet of it, they are flanking. Flanking creatures have **Advantage** on melee attack rolls against that enemy.

**Grid Variant:** Two creatures flank an enemy when they're on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space.

### Cleaving Through Creatures

If your melee attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it.

### Climbing onto Bigger Creatures

A suitably large creature can be treated as terrain. A Small or Medium creature can try to climb a creature at least two sizes larger, using an action and making a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the larger creature's Dexterity (Acrobatics).

### Disarm

A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or object from a target's grasp. Make an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The attacker has disadvantage if the target is holding the item with two or more hands.

### Mark

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. While marked, the creature has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you. The mark ends early if you become incapacitated, die, or someone else marks the creature.

### Overrun

When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, it can try to force its way through. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength (Athletics) check. If successful, the mover can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

### Shove Aside

With this option, a creature uses the special Shove attack to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check. If successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within reach.

### Tumble

As an action, you can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space by making a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the creature's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If successful, you can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

## Exploration Variants

### Slow Natural Healing

Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a Long Rest. Instead, they can spend Hit Dice to heal, as with a Short Rest. This makes healing resources more precious.

### Gritty Realism

This variant uses a modified rest system:
- **Short Rest:** 8 hours (overnight)
- **Long Rest:** 7 days of downtime

This variant works well for campaigns emphasizing long journeys and dangerous wilderness.

### Healer's Kit Dependency

A character can't spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest unless someone expends one use of a healer's kit to bandage the character's wounds.

### Encumbrance (Detailed)

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

## Magic Variants

### Spell Points

Instead of spell slots, spellcasters use a pool of spell points to fuel spells.

| Level | Spell Points |
|-------|-------------|
| 1st | 4 |
| 2nd | 6 |
| 3rd | 14 |
| 4th | 17 |
| 5th | 27 |
| 6th | 32 |
| 7th | 38 |
| 8th | 44 |
| 9th | 57 |
| 10th | 64 |
| 11th | 73 |
| 12th | 73 |
| 13th | 83 |
| 14th | 83 |
| 15th | 94 |
| 16th | 94 |
| 17th | 107 |
| 18th | 114 |
| 19th | 123 |
| 20th | 133 |

| Spell Level | Point Cost |
|-------------|------------|
| 1st | 2 |
| 2nd | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |
| 4th | 6 |
| 5th | 7 |
| 6th | 9 |
| 7th | 10 |
| 8th | 11 |
| 9th | 13 |

### Scroll Mishaps

When a creature tries to cast a spell from a spell scroll but fails, roll on the Scroll Mishap table (percentile dice):

| d100 | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 01-05 | Scroll disintegrates in a flash |
| 06-10 | The spell targets the reader |
| 11-20 | The spell targets a random creature within 60 feet |
| 21-30 | The spell's effect is delayed by 1d12 hours |
| 31-40 | An illusion of the caster appears and pantomimes casting |
| 41-50 | The reader is teleported to a random location within 100 feet |
| 51-60 | A random creature within 60 feet is charmed by the reader |
| 61-70 | 1d4 creatures within 30 feet take 1d6 force damage |
| 71-80 | A 15-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness appears |
| 81-90 | The reader gains one level of exhaustion |
| 91-100 | Nothing happens; the scroll is preserved |

### Component Pouch vs. Focus

Some DMs allow any spellcaster to use either a component pouch or an arcane/druidic/holy focus interchangeably. Others restrict focuses to specific classes.

## Social Variants

### Honor

Honor measures how well a character upholds the ideals of their community. Characters gain or lose Honor based on their actions. High Honor might grant social benefits; low Honor might result in ostracism.

**Starting Honor:** Determined by background and DM
**Maximum:** 20
**Minimum:** 0

### Sanity

Sanity measures mental fortitude against cosmic horrors, eldritch knowledge, and supernatural terror. Facing such horrors requires Sanity saving throws.

**Starting Sanity:** Equal to Intelligence or Wisdom (player choice)
**Maximum:** 20
**Losing Sanity:** Failed saves against horror reduce Sanity
**Recovery:** Long rests in safe locations, certain spells

## Combat Speed Variants

### Side Initiative

Instead of individual initiative, each side rolls once:
1. Each side rolls 1d20
2. Highest roll goes first
3. That side's members act in any order
4. Then the other side acts

This speeds up combat but reduces tactical granularity.

### Speed Factor

Modify initiative based on actions:
- **Melee (light):** +2 to initiative
- **Melee (two-handed):** -2 to initiative
- **Ranged (light):** +2 to initiative
- **Ranged (heavy):** -5 to initiative
- **Spells (1-3 level):** +0 to initiative
- **Spells (4-6 level):** -2 to initiative
- **Spells (7-9 level):** -5 to initiative

## Recommended Combinations

| Campaign Style | Recommended Variants |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Gritty Survival | Gritty Realism, Slow Natural Healing, Encumbrance |
| Heroic Action | Flanking, Cleaving, Standard Rests |
| Horror | Sanity, Scroll Mishaps, Slow Natural Healing |

## Implementing Variants

1. **Discuss with your group** before implementing
2. **Start small** - add one or two variants at a time
3. **Trial period** - use for 3-4 sessions before committing
4. **Document house rules** so everyone remembers
5. **Be willing to remove** variants that don't work
