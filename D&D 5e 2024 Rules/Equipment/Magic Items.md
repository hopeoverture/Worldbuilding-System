# Magic Items Reference

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.

## Rarity

Each magic item has a rarity that indicates how easy it is to find.

| Rarity | Character Level | Value Range |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Common | 1st+ | 50-100 gp |
| Uncommon | 1st+ | 101-500 gp |
| Rare | 5th+ | 501-5,000 gp |
| Very Rare | 11th+ | 5,001-50,000 gp |
| Legendary | 17th+ | 50,001+ gp |
| Artifact | — | Priceless |

The "Character Level" column suggests the minimum level a character should be before the DM places such an item in their path.

## Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before using their magical properties.

### Attuning to an Item
Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a Short Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. A creature can be attuned to no more than **three magic items** at a time.

### Ending Attunement
A creature's attunement to an item ends if:
- The creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement
- The item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours
- The creature dies
- Another creature attunes to the item
- The creature voluntarily ends attunement (no action required)

### Attunement Requirements
Some items require specific creatures to attune:
- **By a spellcaster:** Must have the Spellcasting feature
- **By a [class]:** Must have at least one level in that class
- **By a creature of [alignment]:** Must have that alignment
- **By a creature of [type]:** Must be that creature type

## Cursed Items

Some magic items bear curses that aren't apparent until the item is used or attuned. Curses might include:

- Cannot willingly part with the item
- Item cannot be removed once equipped
- Disadvantage on certain rolls
- Attracts specific enemies
- Drains health or resources
- Imposes alignment changes

**Identifying Curses:** An *Identify* spell reveals if an item is cursed but doesn't reveal the nature of the curse. The DM might allow a thorough examination to hint at a curse.

**Removing Curses:** The *Remove Curse* spell breaks a creature's attunement to a cursed item but doesn't remove the curse from the item itself.

## Sentient Magic Items

Some magic items possess sentience and can communicate with their wielders.

### Characteristics
- **Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma:** 3d6 for each
- **Communication:** Speech, telepathy, empathy
- **Senses:** Hearing and sight (varies)
- **Alignment:** Any
- **Purpose:** Specific goals

### Conflict
If a sentient item's desires conflict with its wielder's, the item might try to take control. The wielder must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC = 12 + item's Charisma modifier) or be charmed by the item.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are unique, irreplaceable magic items of immense power. They cannot be created by mortal means and often have specific conditions for their destruction.

### Common Artifact Properties
Artifacts typically grant:
- Multiple powerful abilities
- Legendary resistance
- Immunity to certain effects
- Sentience (often)

### Destroying Artifacts
Each artifact has specific destruction conditions, such as:
- Cast into a specific location
- Struck by another artifact
- Willingly destroyed by its creator
- Subject to specific ritual

## Identifying Magic Items

### Short Rest
Examining a magic item during a Short Rest allows you to learn its properties and how to use them.

### Identify Spell
The *Identify* spell immediately reveals an item's properties, including whether it requires attunement, how many charges it has, and whether it is cursed.

### Experimentation
Trying to use an item can reveal its properties, though this might be dangerous with cursed items.
