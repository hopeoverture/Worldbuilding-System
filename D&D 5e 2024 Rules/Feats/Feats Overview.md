# Feats Overview

> [!info] Quick Reference
> The 2024 Player's Handbook contains 75 feats divided into four categories: Origin Feats (10), General Feats (~50), Fighting Style Feats (~10), and Epic Boon Feats (~8).

---

## Feat Categories

| Category | When Available | Count |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| [[Origin Feats]] | 1st level (from Background) | 10 |
| [[General Feats]] | 4th+ level (or any ASI) | ~50 |
| [[Fighting Style Feats]] | 4th+ level, martial classes at 1st | ~10 |
| [[Epic Boon Feats]] | 19th level only | ~8 |

---

## Key Changes from 2014

### Feat Integration
- **2014**: Feats were optional; you chose feat OR ability score increase
- **2024**: Feats are core; they often include ability score increases

### New Categories
- **Origin Feats**: Everyone gets one at 1st level from their Background
- **Epic Boons**: 19th-level capstone feats replacing ASI

### Ability Score Increases
Many 2024 feats include a +1 to a relevant ability score, making them less of a tradeoff with ASIs.

---

## Repeatable Feats

These feats can be taken multiple times:

| Feat | Category | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| Ability Score Improvement | General | +2 to one / +1 to two scores |
| Elemental Adept | General | Choose different element each time |
| Magic Initiate | Origin/General | Choose different class each time |
| Skilled | Origin/General | Choose different skills each time |

## When to Take Feats

### At 1st Level (Origin Feat)
Everyone gets one from their Background. Humans get TWO.

**Best general choices**:
- **Alert**: Best for going first
- **Lucky**: Always useful
- **Tough**: Extra HP forever
- **Magic Initiate**: Free spells

### At 4th Level
First ASI opportunity. Consider:
- If primary ability is 15 → Feat with +1 to that ability
- If primary ability is 16+ → Pure feat or ASI

### At 8th+ Level
- Build-defining feats if you haven't taken them
- Shore up weaknesses (Resilient)
- Utility options (Ritual Caster)

### At 19th Level (Epic Boon)
Choose based on your character's role. See [[Epic Boon Feats]].
