## Taking Fighting Style as a Feat

Any character can take a Fighting Style feat at 4th level or later.

**Good non-martial choices**:
- **Rogue**: Archery (+2 helps Sneak Attack hit)
- **Cleric (melee)**: Dueling or Defense
- **Bard (Valor)**: Already has access, but Archery if ranged

**Note**: You can't take the same Fighting Style twice even through different sources.

## Multiclass Considerations

If multiclassing into multiple classes with Fighting Styles:
- Each style can only be taken once
- Champions get Additional Fighting Style at 7th
- Consider complementary styles (Defense + Dueling)
