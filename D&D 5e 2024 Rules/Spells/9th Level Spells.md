**Creature to Creature**: Transform into any creature with CR ≤ level (or CR). If kept for full duration, transformation becomes permanent.

|--------|--------|
| Casting Time | 1 Action |
| Range | Self |
| Components | V |
| Duration | Instantaneous |

The mightiest spell a mortal can cast. State your wish and the DM determines the outcome.

**Safe Uses** (no stress):

- Up to 20 creatures regain all HP, end all effects as per Greater Restoration
- Up to 10 creatures gain resistance to one damage type for 8 hours
- Up to 10 creatures gain immunity to one spell or magical effect for 8 hours
- Undo single recent event by forcing a reroll

**Risky Uses**: Anything beyond safe uses might:

- Succeed with unintended consequences
- Cause 1d10 necrotic damage per spell level duplicated
- STR drops to 3 for 2d4 days
- 33% chance of never casting Wish again
