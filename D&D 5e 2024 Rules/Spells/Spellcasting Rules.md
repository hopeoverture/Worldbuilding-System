# Spellcasting Rules

> [!info] Quick Reference
> Spellcasting allows characters to channel magical energy through spell slots, components, and concentration. The 2024 rules clarify many edge cases and standardize spell school descriptions.

## Spell Slots

### How Slots Work
- Casting a spell expends a slot of the spell's level or higher
- Slots are recovered after a Long Rest (most classes)
- Higher-level slots can cast lower-level spells
- Some spells gain benefits when cast at higher levels ("upcasting")

### Slots by Class Level

| Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

## Preparing Spells

### Prepared Casters
**Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard**

- Can cast any prepared spell using available slots

### Known Casters
**Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock**

- Fixed number of spells known
- Learn new spells at certain levels
- Can swap one spell when leveling up

### Always Prepared
Some subclasses grant "always prepared" spells:
- Don't count against prepared limit
- Always available to cast

---

## Multiclassing and Spells

### Spell Slots
- Combine caster levels using the multiclass table
- Full casters: 1 level = 1 slot level
- Half casters (Paladin, Ranger): 1 level = 0.5 slot levels
- Warlock: Pact Magic is separate

### Spells Known/Prepared
- Each class separately
- Can only learn spells your class level allows
- Example: Wizard 3/Cleric 2 can learn 2nd-level spells for both classes

### Using Higher Slots
- Can use any slot for any class's spells
- Paladin with wizard levels can smite with wizard slots

---

## Special Rules

### Combining Magical Effects
- Same spell doesn't stack with itself
- Different spells can combine
- Most potent effect applies if overlapping

### Counterspell and Dispel Magic
- Counterspell: Interrupt casting
- Dispel Magic: End ongoing spell
- Both may require ability check for higher-level spells

### Identifying Spells
- **Reaction**: Arcana check (DC 15 + spell level)
- **Action**: Study the spell's effects (same DC)
- Only works as spell is being cast or immediately after
