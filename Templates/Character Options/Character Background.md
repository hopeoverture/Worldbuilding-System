> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a character background, create a compelling origin story with mechanical benefits following D&D 5e (2024) rules. Backgrounds now provide: ability score increases (+2/+1 or +1/+1/+1 from three options), two skill proficiencies, one tool proficiency, starting equipment, and an Origin feat. The background should tell a story about who the character was before adventuring.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this background's identity—what life the character led, what skills they developed, and what drove them toward adventure.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on character and setting, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this background, include:
- **Life before adventure:** The daily routines, environments, and relationships that shaped who this person became
- **Skill manifestation:** Evidence of the proficiencies this background grants—the tools in hand, the practiced movements, the expert eye
- **Social context:** The people, places, and hierarchies that defined life before the call to adventure
- **Formative environment:** The workshop, ship, temple, or street that was this person's world
- **Transitional moment:** The tension between the known life and the unknown path ahead
- **Identity markers:** Clothing, equipment, mannerisms, and posture that reveal origin at a glance

### Background Integration (Backgrounds Are Origins Made Visible)
Every element should express the character's history, their skills, and the life that shaped them:
- *Don't write:* "sailor on a ship" → *Write:* "the bosun who has spent twenty years reading storms—hands rope-burned and salt-roughened, the particular squint of someone who has stared at horizons until they see weather before it arrives, bare feet that know every deck plank, the easy balance of a body that has forgotten what stillness feels like"
- *Don't write:* "noble at court" → *Write:* "the second daughter of a minor house navigating her first grand ball—posture drilled into her bones by tutors who struck her shoulders with canes, dress expensive enough to beggar her family for a year, the particular smile that shows nothing while calculating everything, the trained grace that makes every movement a statement"
- *Don't write:* "criminal in the streets" → *Write:* "the thief who grew up learning the city's hidden geography—the rooftop paths, the sewer shortcuts, the guards' patrol patterns mapped in memory, clothes that let her blend with any crowd, the casual awareness that notices every escape route before entering any room"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Backgrounds
- **Tool familiarity:** The worn handle, the instinctive grip, the tool that feels like an extension of self
- **Environmental adaptation:** Calluses, tan lines, posture habits shaped by years in specific settings
- **Social tells:** The bow that reveals training, the handshake that shows profession, the deference or confidence that marks class
- **Wardrobe archaeology:** Clothing that tells history—mended expensive fabric, practical modifications, hidden pockets
- **Skill evidence:** Ink stains, sword calluses, prayer beads, the physical marks of practiced abilities
- **Transitional tension:** The moment between the known world and the adventure to come

### Character in Their Element
The background embodied—a life before adventure.

**Template:**
> [Background in natural context—e.g., "the master smith in the forge that has been her family's for three generations, the moment before adventure called her away from everything she knew"]. [The setting—e.g., "the forge at the hour when the fire burns hottest, tools arranged by generations of the same hands, the anvil worn smooth by ten thousand hammer strikes, the particular organization of a workspace that belongs to someone who has never known another life"]. [The character—e.g., "the smith at the peak of her craft, arms corded with muscle that came from years of honest work, the particular stance of someone who knows exactly where every tool is without looking, sweat and soot painting a face that has never questioned its purpose until today"]. [Background skills visible—e.g., "hands that judge metal temperature by color, the instinctive assessment of an edge's quality, the proficiency with hammer and tongs that will translate to other tools when the forge is left behind"]. [Social context—e.g., "the apprentice in the corner who expected to inherit this place, the orders from the merchant guild, the life of respected craft that is about to end"]. [Transitional tension—e.g., "the sword commission that waits on the rack, the one that will be her last before the road, the future visible in her eyes even as she stands in her past"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on character and setting, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy artisan background illustration" or "Fantasy smith origin scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Origin Moment
The call to adventure—the instant life changed.

**Template:**
> [The pivotal moment—e.g., "the night the scholar found the map that showed a location no other map contained, the discovery that would end her life of dusty libraries and begin something she had only read about in legends"]. [The setting—e.g., "the archive at midnight, lamp guttering as she unfolds parchment that hasn't been touched in centuries, the silence of a thousand books watching, the particular dust that only the deepest collections accumulate"]. [The discovery or event—e.g., "the map itself wrong in ways that suggest the mapmaker saw things no one else had, annotations in a language she recognizes but cannot read, the mark indicating something hidden in a place she always thought she knew"]. [Emotional weight—e.g., "the recognition that this changes everything, the fear and excitement indistinguishable, the understanding that she cannot unknow what she now knows"]. [Background skills engaging—e.g., "the research instincts already cataloging questions, the languages partially translating, the historian's mind already building hypotheses"]. [Future visible—e.g., "the travelling pack she will buy tomorrow, the comfortable life that ends with this discovery, the adventure beginning in the recognition that books are no longer enough"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on character and setting, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy scholar origin moment illustration" or "Fantasy call to adventure scene"].
