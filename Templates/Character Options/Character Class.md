> [!info] Generation Instructions

Classes have a primary ability, hit die, proficiencies, and features gained at each level. Subclasses are selected at level 3 (standard) with features at levels 3, 6, 10, and 14. Include both mechanical depth and rich flavor that supports diverse character concepts.

## Overview

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on character and equipment, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this class, include:
- **Power source visible:** The magic, martial discipline, divine connection, or other source that defines the class made tangible
- **Signature equipment:** The weapons, armor, and tools that are iconic to this class—not generic gear but class-defining items
- **Class stance:** The particular way this class holds themselves—the fighter's trained guard, the wizard's scholarly bearing, the rogue's alert readiness
- **Ability manifestation:** What the class's signature features look like in action—rage, spellcasting, divine channeling, sneak attacks
- **Training evidence:** The physical and mental conditioning that made this person what they are
- **Role expression:** Combat role visible in positioning, equipment, and attitude—tank, striker, support, controller

### Class Integration (Classes Are Callings Made Combat-Ready)
Every element should express the class's power, their role, and their fantasy archetype:
- *Don't write:* "wizard casting a spell" → *Write:* "the archmage at the moment of invocation—thirty years of study focused through gestures her body knows better than breathing, arcane words reshaping reality as they leave her lips, the particular concentration of someone holding forces that could destroy her if her focus wavers for an instant, power visible in the air around her like heat shimmer"
- *Don't write:* "fighter in armor" → *Write:* "the knight whose body has been a weapon since childhood—armor fitted so perfectly it moves like a second skin, the sword grip worn to the exact shape of her palm, the particular stillness of someone who has trained until every movement is lethal efficiency, eyes that assess threat and distance without conscious thought"
- *Don't write:* "rogue in shadows" → *Write:* "the assassin who has become part of the darkness—perfectly still in a shadow that shouldn't hide anyone, blades that make no sound leaving their sheaths, the patient predator's breathing that makes no vapor in the cold, eyes that have mapped every guard patrol and found the one gap that makes tonight possible"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Classes
- **Power manifestation:** What magic, rage, divine grace, or ki looks like around this class
- **Equipment mastery:** Weapons and tools so familiar they are extensions of self
- **Physical conditioning:** The body shape created by this class's training and lifestyle
- **Class tells:** The small signs that reveal class to those who know what to look for
- **Combat readiness:** The particular awareness and positioning that defines how this class approaches danger
- **Iconic moments:** The signature actions that define what this class does best

### Class in Action
The class at peak performance—power fully expressed.

**Template:**
> [Class power unleashed—e.g., "the barbarian at the heart of the battle rage, the moment when fury and combat become indistinguishable, the ancestral spirits visible in the red mist around him"]. [The situation—e.g., "surrounded by enemies who thought numbers would be enough, the first three already falling, the rest beginning to realize what they've awakened, the particular chaos of a fight that has become a slaughter"]. [Power manifestation—e.g., "the rage visible as something between heat shimmer and barely-contained lightning, wounds that should slow him closing as his ancestors' fury heals what his enemies damage, the strength that comes from somewhere beyond muscle"]. [Signature equipment—e.g., "the great axe that weighs nothing in his hands, the tribal markings that glow when the spirits ride him, armor that is more tradition than protection because he doesn't need protection"]. [Combat mastery—e.g., "the fighting style that looks like chaos but has been honed since he could lift a weapon, the economy of movement that wastes nothing, the perfect savagery that is somehow also discipline"]. [Environment—e.g., "the battlefield already scattered with the broken, the surviving enemies hesitating, the moment before he moves and more fall"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on character and equipment, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy barbarian combat illustration" or "Fantasy rage warrior action scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Iconic Pose
The class embodied—identity captured in stillness.

**Template:**
> [Class identity crystallized—e.g., "the paladin in the moment before battle, the certainty of her oath visible in every line of her body, the divine light that surrounds her because her god's attention is always upon her"]. [Signature stance—e.g., "sword held in the guard position her order has used for eight centuries, shield bearing the symbol that enemies have learned to fear, the particular posture of someone who has never doubted and never will"]. [Equipment as identity—e.g., "plate armor that glows faintly with consecrated light, the sword that was blessed when she took her vows and has never been drawn in an unjust cause, the holy symbol that rests against her heart"]. [Power source visible—e.g., "divine radiance that leaks from her eyes when she is focused, the sense that something vast watches through her, the particular gravity of someone who carries a god's attention everywhere she goes"]. [Background context—e.g., "the cathedral where she was ordained visible behind her, or the battlefield where her faith was tested, or the place where the innocent she protects wait"]. [Class essence—e.g., "the absolute conviction that makes paladins what they are—not arrogance but certainty, not fanaticism but faith so pure it has become power"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on character and equipment, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy paladin portrait illustration" or "Fantasy divine champion pose"].
