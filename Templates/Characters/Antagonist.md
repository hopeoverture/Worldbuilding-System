> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an antagonist, create a compelling villain or opposing force with understandable (if not sympathetic) motivations. The best antagonists believe they are justified in their actions. Ensure all D&D 5e (2024) statistics are accurate. The character should present a meaningful threat and challenge to protagonists.
>
> **Naming Reference:** See [[D&D Species Naming Conventions]] for species-appropriate naming patterns, linguistic elements, and cultural naming customs. Villain names can subvert conventions (a tiefling rejecting their infernal name) or embrace darker elements of their heritage.
