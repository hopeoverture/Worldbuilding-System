## Image Prompts

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, fabric, metal, and materials, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
For background characters, keep image prompts focused but include 2-3 distinctive facial features:
- **Subject:** Species, gender, age range, occupation
- **Face (pick 2-3 distinctive features):** Even minor NPCs need identifying traits:
  - *One memorable facial feature:* crooked nose, prominent ears, heavy brow, gap-toothed smile, lazy eye
  - *Face character:* round and friendly, gaunt and tired, ruddy from drink, sun-weathered, careworn
  - *Distinctive mark:* notable scar, missing tooth, pockmarks, mole, bushy eyebrows
  - *Expression habit:* perpetual frown, easy smile, squinting suspicion, nervous twitch
- **Expression:** Simple emotion fitting their demeanor and occupation
- **Attire:** Work clothes or common garb appropriate to role
- **Pose:** Doing their job or in a natural idle stance
- **Setting:** Their workplace or typical location
- **Lighting:** Natural or appropriate to workplace

### Quick Psychology (Even Minor NPCs Have Stories)
Even background characters should have features that hint at a life:
- *Simple version:* "tired eyes from long shifts" rather than just "tired eyes"
- *Simple version:* "callused hands" → "callused hands permanently curved from holding reins all day"
- *Simple version:* "gap-toothed smile" → "gap-toothed smile that appears easily and often, the face of someone content with simple pleasures"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Background Characters
- **Single memorable trait:** the serving girl with the birthmark, the guard with the missing ear, the baker with flour perpetually in his beard
- **Occupation stamp:** squint from sewing, stoop from mining, calluses in specific patterns
- **Personality in one detail:** the nervous twitch, the easy grin, the suspicious squint at strangers
