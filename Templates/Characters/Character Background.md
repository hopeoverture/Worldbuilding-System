> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a character background, create a compelling origin story with mechanical benefits following D&D 5e (2024) rules. Backgrounds now provide: ability score increases (+2/+1 or +1/+1/+1 from three options), two skill proficiencies, one tool proficiency, starting equipment, and an Origin feat. The background should tell a story about who the character was before adventuring.
