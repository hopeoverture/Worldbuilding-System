> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a divine servant, create an agent of godly power with clear purpose, distinct personality, and appropriate limitations. Consider their relationship with their deity, how they manifest to mortals, and what drives them. Divine servants should feel otherworldly yet comprehensible—beings of immense power constrained by divine law and purpose.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on divine radiance and celestial features, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this divine servant, include:
- **Form Type:** True divine form, humanoid manifestation, or symbolic representation
- **Divine Features:** Wings, halos, radiance, extra limbs, multiple faces, crystalline elements
- **Face (Even for Divine Beings):** Specific features that convey personality and purpose
- **Divine Indicators:** Holy light, celestial geometry, sacred symbols, ethereal effects
- **Scale & Presence:** Size relative to mortals, weight of divine authority
- **Expression:** Otherworldly emotion appropriate to purpose (serene judgment, compassionate warning, terrible beauty)
- **Domain Markers:** Visual elements that reflect their deity's domains

### Psychology Integration (Divine Yet Personal)
Divine servants are not human, but they are not emotionless—their features should convey their eternal purpose and the weight of ages:
- *Don't write:* "beautiful face" → *Write:* "a face of terrible beauty, features so perfect they approach the uncanny, symmetry that mortal minds struggle to process—the face of something made rather than born, each line placed with divine intention"
- *Don't write:* "glowing eyes" → *Write:* "eyes of pure golden light without pupil or iris, seeing not just the flesh but the soul within, weighing sins and virtues with each moment of contact"
- *Don't write:* "serene expression" → *Write:* "an expression of absolute serenity that offers no comfort, the peace of something that has witnessed thousands of deaths and knows each one serves a greater purpose"
- *Don't write:* "radiating light" → *Write:* "light emanating from within like dawn through stained glass, warm where it touches the faithful but burning where it meets corruption, casting no shadows because they carry their own illumination"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Divine Servants
- **Otherworldly beauty:** features that shift subtly between viewings, perfection that inspires awe rather than attraction, eyes that reflect events from the viewer's past
- **Signs of eternal service:** wear on wings that never heals, ancient weariness in ageless eyes, the weight of millennia in each deliberate movement
- **Domain manifestations:** a death-servant with skull motifs grown into the skin, a war-herald with armor fused to flesh, a mercy-angel with hands perpetually stained with healing tears
- **Divine hierarchy markers:** more or fewer wings by rank, complexity of halos, intensity of radiance, number of eyes
- **Mortal interaction adaptations:** features softened when speaking to mortals, true form bleeding through at the edges, form struggling to contain power in mortal space

### Divine Manifestation
The divine servant appearing before mortals, showing their power and purpose.

**Template:**
> [Divine servant name], [servant type—e.g., "herald of the sun god"], manifesting in [form with specifics—e.g., "winged humanoid form of impossible beauty, tall as three men, proportions that suggest humanity without being human"]. [Face with divine character—e.g., "a face of androgynous perfection, features shifting subtly with each viewing as if the mind cannot hold them steady, golden skin luminous from within; eyes of pure white-gold flame without pupil or iris, seeing and judging in the same glance; lips that seem never to have known expression until this moment now set in solemn pronouncement"]. [Body with divine markers—e.g., "four wings of white fire rather than feathers, each pinion a tongue of controlled flame, upper pair folded behind like a cloak, lower pair spread to fill the space with terrible glory"]. [Divine radiance—e.g., "radiance pouring from within, golden light that casts no shadows but reveals every hidden thing, dust motes catching fire and burning to nothing in the presence"]. [Attire with purpose—e.g., "robes of woven light in the gold and white of their deity, armor of crystallized divinity visible beneath where battle awaits, holy symbols etched in constellations across the raiment"]. [Hands visible—e.g., "one hand raised in blessing or warning (the gesture serves for both), fingers too long and too perfectly shaped, the other hand resting on a sword of condensed starlight"]. [Expression with purpose—e.g., "expression of sorrowful necessity, the face of something that brings terrible news with perfect compassion, knowing the pain it will cause and finding that pain worthy of acknowledgment"]. [Setting—e.g., "materializing in a humble temple, the mundane architecture straining to contain the divine presence, stone walls lit from within by the reflected glory"]. [Mortal reaction if present—e.g., "a priestess fallen to her knees in the foreground, face illuminated by divine light, expression torn between terror and rapture"]. [Lighting—e.g., "the servant as the light source, all other illumination irrelevant, creating a sphere of day in what was midnight darkness"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on divine radiance and celestial features, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy solar angel manifestation illustration" or "Fantasy divine herald appearing illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Symbol/Icon
Religious artistic representation as the faithful depict this divine servant.

**Template:**
> Artistic representation of [divine servant name] in the style of [art form—e.g., "an illuminated manuscript page from the sacred texts"], depicting [the servant's iconic image—e.g., "the moment of their first appearance to mortals during the Sundering War"]. [Artistic style—e.g., "medieval religious illumination with gold leaf, rich pigments, stylized perspective that places the divine larger than mortals"]. [Symbolic elements—e.g., "four wings spread to frame the page, each feather containing a smaller scene from sacred history; a halo of concentric circles inscribed with holy verses; a flaming sword held downward in judgment"]. [Sacred symbols—e.g., "the solar disc behind the head, rays extending to illuminate the faithful who reach upward; the seven-pointed star of the pantheon in each corner"]. [Colors with meaning—e.g., "gold leaf for all divine elements catching real light, ultramarine blue worth more than gold for the robes, crimson for the flames of justice"]. [Iconographic details—e.g., "the eyes depicted as empty golden circles as mortals dare not presume to capture divine sight, hands in the formal blessing gesture standardized across a thousand years of artistic tradition"]. [Border and context—e.g., "elaborate border of intertwined vines and small figures representing the souls under protection, marginal annotations in ancient script praising the servant's deeds"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the page itself seeming to glow faintly, the work of a scribe who labored in devotion for a decade"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on divine radiance and celestial features, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy sacred manuscript illumination" or "Fantasy religious iconography illustration"].
