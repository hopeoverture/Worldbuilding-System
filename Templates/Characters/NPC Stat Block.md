> [!info] Generation Instructions
> This template is for combat-focused NPC stat blocks—guards, bandits, monsters, and other creatures the party might fight. For NPCs with significant story roles, use Protagonist, Antagonist, or Support Character templates instead.
>
> **Use this template when:**
> - You need quick combat stats without detailed backstory
> - The NPC is one of many (guards, cultists, bandits)
> - The focus is mechanical rather than narrative
>
> **CR Guidelines:**
