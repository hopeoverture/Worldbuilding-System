> **Stat Block Mode:** Protagonists default to level-based (PC-style) statistics with class features and spell slots. The `challenge_rating:` field is optional for converting this character to NPC stat block format for combat encounters. See [[D&D 5e Stat Block Validation]] for conversion guidelines.
>
> **Naming Reference:** See [[D&D Species Naming Conventions]] for species-appropriate naming patterns, linguistic elements, and cultural naming customs. Names should reflect the character's species, culture, and background.
