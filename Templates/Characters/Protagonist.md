> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a protagonist, create a compelling hero or main character with depth, clear motivations, and room for growth. Ensure all D&D 5e (2024) statistics are accurate and calculated correctly. The character should feel like someone players would want to follow or play as.
>
> **Stat Block Mode:** Protagonists default to level-based (PC-style) statistics with class features and spell slots. The `challenge_rating:` field is optional for converting this character to NPC stat block format for combat encounters. See [[D&D 5e Stat Block Validation]] for conversion guidelines.
>
> **Naming Reference:** See [[D&D Species Naming Conventions]] for species-appropriate naming patterns, linguistic elements, and cultural naming customs. Names should reflect the character's species, culture, and background.

## Image Prompts

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, fabric, metal, and materials, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this character, include:
- **Subject:** Species, gender, approximate age, body type
- **Face (CRITICAL for uniqueness):** Be extremely specific with facial features:
  - *Face shape:* oval, round, square, heart-shaped, angular, long, diamond
  - *Forehead:* high, low, broad, narrow, prominent brow ridge
  - *Eyebrows:* thick, thin, arched, straight, bushy, scarred through, feathered
  - *Eyes:* deep-set, wide-set, hooded, almond-shaped, round, downturned; specific color with variations (e.g., "pale grey with dark limbal rings")
  - *Nose:* straight, aquiline, button, broad, crooked, hawk-like, upturned, broken
  - *Cheekbones:* high and prominent, low, sunken, rounded, sharp
  - *Lips:* full, thin, bow-shaped, asymmetric, scarred
  - *Chin/Jaw:* strong square jaw, weak chin, pointed, cleft chin, heavy jowls, sharp jawline
  - *Skin:* complexion, freckles, wrinkles, acne scars, pockmarks, weathered, sun-damaged
  - *Distinctive marks:* specific scars (location, shape, origin), birthmarks, moles, tattoos, brand marks
  - *Facial hair:* style, thickness, color, grooming level (if applicable)
- **Expression:** Specific emotion that reveals personality (determined squint, warm half-smile, haunted gaze, confident smirk)
- **Hair:** Style, length, color, texture (straight, wavy, curly, coily), any distinctive elements (grey streaks, braids, shaved sections)
- **Attire:** Clothing style, armor type, signature colors
- **Pose:** Action or stance that reflects their role (heroic, contemplative, battle-ready)
- **Equipment:** Visible weapons, shields, magical items, accessories
- **Setting:** Environment that contextualizes the character (tavern, battlefield, throne room)
- **Lighting:** Mood lighting (dramatic shadows, warm firelight, ethereal glow)

### Psychology Integration (CRITICAL)
Every physical feature should reveal character, history, and psychology. Don't just describe WHAT features look like—describe what they SUGGEST about the person:
- *Don't write:* "thin lips" → *Write:* "thin lips pressed into a habitual line of patience, softening only at the corners when amused"
- *Don't write:* "blue eyes" → *Write:* "pale blue eyes that hold steady when others look away, the gaze of someone accustomed to hard truths"
- *Don't write:* "weathered skin" → *Write:* "sun-weathered skin mapped with laugh lines around the eyes and worry lines across the brow—the face of someone who has lived fully in joy and grief"
- *Don't write:* "broken nose" → *Write:* "a nose broken and reset slightly crooked, worn like a badge from the fight that taught them to never underestimate an opponent"

### Hands Visible (Optional but Recommended)
For bust portraits, consider including visible hands which reveal character:
- Work-roughened with specific calluses (sword grip, rope handling, pen calluses)
- Gestures that reveal personality (open and welcoming, clenched with tension, fingers touching thoughtfully)
- Details that tell history (scarred knuckles, ink-stained fingers, missing finger, wedding band indent)

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Protagonists
- **Eyes that tell their arc:** weary but unbroken, haunted but hopeful, fierce but fair
- **Marks of experience:** scars from formative events, calluses from their craft, weathering from their journey
- **Signs of internal conflict:** tension in the jaw from words unsaid, premature grey from burdens carried, smile lines fighting with frown lines
- **Heroic imperfections:** the broken nose they never had reset, the scar they could have healed but kept as a reminder, asymmetry that makes them real

### Portrait (Bust)
Close-up framing from chest up, focusing on face and upper body details. Include hands if they would add character.

**Template:**

[Hands visible if included—e.g., "hands visible, left resting on sword pommel with sword-caller's calluses, right hand open in a gesture of parley"]. Wearing [detailed attire with condition and meaning—e.g., "well-worn traveling leathers over a faded green tunic, practical rather than impressive, a silver clasp at the throat that was their mother's"].

[Specific expression with story—e.g., "expression of focused determination, the look of someone about to step into danger for someone else's sake"]. [Hair description with movement and condition—e.g., "dark hair pulled back in a warrior's knot, practical and severe, a few strands escaped and whipping in the wind"].

Background: [detailed setting with atmosphere—e.g., "burning village behind them, smoke and ash swirling, the orange glow of flames silhouetting their determination"].
