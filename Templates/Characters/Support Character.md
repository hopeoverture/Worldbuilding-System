> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a support character, create a memorable NPC who serves a clear purpose in the story while feeling like a real person with their own life beyond their utility to protagonists. They should have enough depth to be interesting but remain focused on their narrative role. Ensure D&D 5e (2024) statistics are accurate if combat-relevant.
>
> **Stat Block Mode:** For combat-relevant NPCs, choose ONE:
> - **Level-based:** Fill `level:` for NPCs with class features (e.g., "Level 5 Cleric ally")
> - **CR-based:** Fill `challenge_rating:` for simpler combat stats (e.g., "CR 2 Guard Captain")
>
> Leave combat stats blank for non-combat support characters (merchants, informants, etc.)
>
> **Naming Reference:** See [[D&D Species Naming Conventions]] for species-appropriate naming patterns. Support characters' names should reflect their cultural background and social status.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, fabric, metal, and materials, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this support character, include:
- **Subject:** Species, gender, age, body type, occupation indicators
- **Face (CRITICAL for uniqueness):** Be extremely specific with facial features:
  - *Face shape:* round and friendly, long and scholarly, square and dependable, weathered, careworn
  - *Forehead:* worry lines, laugh lines at temples, age spots, receding hairline
  - *Eyebrows:* expressive, grey-flecked, perpetually raised, furrowed with concern
  - *Eyes:* kind and crinkled, sharp and observant, tired, twinkling with humor; specific color and character (e.g., "warm brown eyes with crow's feet")
  - *Nose:* bulbous, sharp, crooked from old break, red-tipped from drink, distinguished
  - *Cheekbones:* ruddy and full, gaunt from hardship, dimpled when smiling
  - *Lips:* frequently smiling, pursed with worry, chapped from weather, thin and disapproving
  - *Chin/Jaw:* double chin, strong and trustworthy, weak, stubbled
  - *Skin:* sun-weathered, indoor pallor, laugh lines, age spots, work-roughened
  - *Character marks:* occupational calluses, ink-stained fingers, flour-dusted, soot marks, tan lines
  - *Distinctive marks:* old scars with stories, birthmarks, beauty marks, wrinkles that tell their history
  - *Facial hair:* practical stubble, well-groomed beard, unkempt from busy work
- **Expression:** Specific emotion reflecting their role (wise knowing smile, worried frown, warm welcoming grin, shrewd assessment)
- **Hair:** Style appropriate to their station and personality (practical, distinguished, messy from work)
- **Attire:** Clothing that signals their profession or status
- **Pose:** Natural stance that fits their character (welcoming, working, guarded)
- **Equipment:** Tools of their trade, meaningful personal items
- **Setting:** Where they're typically found (shop, tavern, temple, road)
- **Lighting:** Appropriate to setting (warm interior, natural outdoor, candlelit)

### Psychology Integration (CRITICAL for Memorable NPCs)
Support characters should have faces that tell their life story—every line, mark, and expression revealing who they are and what they've been through:
- *Don't write:* "friendly face" → *Write:* "a round friendly face with deep laugh lines framing the mouth and crow's feet at the eyes—the face of someone who has found joy in small things and shared it freely with others"
- *Don't write:* "old hands" → *Write:* "hands visible, thick-fingered and strong, the right thumb permanently bent from forty years of hammer work, calluses like leather over the palms"
- *Don't write:* "tired eyes" → *Write:* "kind brown eyes ringed with exhaustion, the tiredness of someone who stays up late worrying about others rather than themselves"
- *Don't write:* "grey beard" → *Write:* "a grey beard kept neat and trimmed, food occasionally caught in it from distracted eating, a habit his late wife used to tease him about"

### Hands Visible (Essential for Working NPCs)
For support characters, hands are where their story is written:
- Occupation-specific details (blacksmith's burn scars, healer's herb stains, scholar's ink spots, farmer's calluses)
- Gesture revealing personality (wiping hands on apron from nervous habit, fingers counting coins automatically, hands clasped in prayer)
- History markers (wedding band worn thin, missing digit from old accident, tremor from age or injury)
- Current activity (polishing a glass, mending clothing, holding a tool of their trade)

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Support Characters
- **Occupation markers:** smith's burns in specific patterns, scholar's squint from candlelit reading, sailor's weathered skin and rope-burned palms, cook's heat-reddened cheeks
- **Signs of their journey:** grey appearing early from worry over loved ones, weight gained from comfort eating, thin from giving food to others, strong from honest labor
- **Personality in features:** perpetual half-smile of an optimist, worried furrow that deepens when speaking of the troubles, eyes that light up when discussing their passion
- **Life interruptions:** the scar from when bandits attacked, the limp that ended their adventuring days, the clouded eye that changed their career
- **Warmth indicators:** rosy cheeks from laughter, warm complexion from hearth-tending, gentle wrinkles from years of smiling at customers

### Portrait (Bust)
Close-up framing from chest up, focusing on approachable features and expression. Include hands if they add character.

[Hands if visible—e.g., "hands visible, massive and capable, the right thumb bent from a hammer accident that never healed straight, calluses thick as leather, currently wiping on a leather apron from habit"]. [Distinctive marks with story—e.g., "an old burn scar curling around the left ear from an ember that jumped, a story that gets funnier with each year"].

Wearing [occupation attire with detail—e.g., "a leather forge-apron over a once-white shirt now permanently grey with ash, sleeves rolled past thick forearms, a simple iron wedding band the only ornament"]. [Natural pose—e.g., "leaning forward slightly with interest, hands visible and open, the posture of someone always ready to help"]. Background: [appropriate setting—e.g., "blurred forge interior with the warm glow of embers, tools hanging on walls, suggesting decades of honest work"].
