> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a language, create a culturally rich communication system with distinctive sounds, grammar features, and writing traditions. Focus on how the language reflects its speakers' values, history, and worldview. Include practical elements like common phrases and cultural significance rather than exhaustive linguistic detail. Languages should feel authentic with naming conventions that influence character and place names.

## Overview
