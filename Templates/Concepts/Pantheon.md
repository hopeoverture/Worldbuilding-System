### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on divine beings and celestial imagery, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this pantheon, include:
- **Divine differentiation:** Each god visually embodying their domain—the storm god stormy, the love goddess luminous with attraction
- **Relationship dynamics:** The alliances, rivalries, and hierarchies visible in positioning and interaction
- **Collective power:** The sense that these beings together maintain the cosmos, their gathering more than the sum of its parts
- **Scale transcendence:** Gods existing at a scale that mortals can barely comprehend, yet somehow rendered visible
- **Domain interaction:** Where different gods' powers meet—sunset as sun and night gods exchange dominion
- **Cosmic setting:** Realms appropriate to divine gatherings—thrones of cloud, halls of pure light, the void between stars

### Pantheon Integration (Pantheons Are Order Made Divine)
Every element should express the relationships and collective power of the divine family:
- *Don't write:* "gods gathered together" → *Write:* "the Seven meet in the Hall of Eternities, each seated on a throne that embodies their domain—the Sun-King on molten gold, the Ocean-Mother on living waves, the War-Father on shields and spears—the hall stretching infinitely to accommodate divine scale, the air between them crackling with contained power and barely restrained ancient grievances"
- *Don't write:* "symbols of different gods" → *Write:* "the Circle of the Seven carved in the altar stone, each deity's symbol in its proper position—the Sun-King's wheel at top as he rules, the Ocean-Mother's wave opposite him as they balance, the others arranged in the hierarchy that mythology teaches and priests debate, the whole design a map of divine politics as much as a focus for prayer"
- *Don't write:* "gods with their powers" → *Write:* "the moment of cosmic creation, the Seven acting in concert for the only time—the Sun-King providing light, the Ocean-Mother the waters, the Earth-Father the land, the others adding their domains in the sequence that the priests teach children, the world taking shape from divine cooperation that ended the moment creation was complete"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Pantheons
- **Domain embodiment:** Each god IS their sphere—not depicting sun but being radiance
- **Hierarchical positioning:** The chief deity elevated or central, rivals opposite, allies adjacent
- **Relationship tension:** Postures and positions suggesting the dynamics between divinities
- **Collective presence:** The whole pantheon greater than individual gods
- **Cosmic setting:** Realms that transcend mortal imagination—spaces of pure concept rather than matter
- **Symbol integration:** Each god's sacred emblems appearing naturally in their form

### Divine Assembly
The pantheon gathered—the powers that shape existence in council.

**Template:**
> [Pantheon in gathering—e.g., "the Seven of the Valdren faith assembled in the Hall of Stars, where they have met since time began to debate the fate of the world they made together"]. [Divine hall—e.g., "a space that exists outside mortal understanding—walls that are the edge of existence, a floor of frozen starlight, thrones arranged in the circle that theology prescribes, each seat a manifestation of its occupant's domain"]. [Individual deities—e.g., "the Sun-King radiant on his throne of captured dawn, his form the light itself given shape; the Ocean-Mother fluid and vast, her presence spilling beyond her throne in waves that lap at nothing; the War-Father solid and scarred, his armor bearing the marks of every battle ever fought; each god a concept made flesh, beautiful and terrible and impossible to look at directly"]. [Relationship dynamics—e.g., "the Sun-King and Ocean-Mother facing each other as mythology demands, neither higher than the other; the War-Father and Peace-Mother deliberately separated; the younger gods in the positions their age and power have earned"]. [Interaction—e.g., "a moment of divine discourse, the gods debating in ways mortals cannot fully perceive, their words reshaping reality, their disagreements causing storms in the mortal world below, their rare consensus creating miracles"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the overwhelming presence of assembled divinity, the sense that creation itself holds its breath when the gods convene, the particular tension of powers that could unmake the universe choosing to cooperate"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on divine beings and celestial imagery, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy divine council illustration" or "Fantasy pantheon assembly scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Pantheon Symbols
The faith's complete iconography—all the gods in a single sacred design.

**Template:**
> [Symbols with meaning—e.g., "the Circle of the Seven carved in marble above the high altar of the Great Temple, the unified symbol of the faith that unites seven divine cults into one religion"]. [Arrangement—e.g., "the symbols arranged in the sacred geometry that theology prescribes—the Sun-King's wheel at apex, the Ocean-Mother's wave at nadir, the others in the positions that reflect divine hierarchy and balance, the whole forming a pattern that's said to resonate with the structure of creation"]. [Individual symbols—e.g., "each god's emblem rendered in appropriate materials—the Sun-King in gold, the Ocean-Mother in sapphire-set silver, the War-Father in iron, the Peace-Mother in white jade—the materials themselves carrying meaning"]. [Craftsmanship—e.g., "made by seven different master artisans each devoted to their deity, assembled by a priest who served all Seven, the work of a generation concentrated in a single sacred object—or rather, the physical expression of millennia of theology"]. [Sacred context—e.g., "mounted above the altar where all Seven are honored together, the light from seven windows catching each symbol in turn as the day passes, the smoke of seven incenses rising to touch them"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the sense that these symbols together are more than decoration—that they are a key, a map, a focus for the divine attention of the entire pantheon, a point where mortal and divine worlds overlap"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on divine beings and celestial imagery, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy pantheon symbols illustration" or "Fantasy divine circle icon"].
