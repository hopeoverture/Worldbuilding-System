> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a plane of existence, create an alternate reality with its own rules, inhabitants, and hazards. Consider how the plane's nature differs from the Material Plane, who lives there, how to reach it, and what draws visitors despite its dangers. Planes should feel like coherent realms with their own logic—places where the normal rules don't apply.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this plane's essential nature—what kind of realm it is, how it differs from the Material Plane, who inhabits it, and why it matters to mortals.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on otherworldly environments and alien features, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this plane, include:
- **Physical impossibility:** Laws of nature that work differently—gravity at wrong angles, time moving visibly, space that loops or stretches
- **Sensory alienation:** Colors, sounds, and textures that don't exist in the Material world
- **Essence manifestation:** The plane's nature visible in everything—a fire plane where even stone burns, a death plane where life itself seems grey
- **Scale distortion:** Distances and sizes that feel wrong, challenging mortal perception
- **Native life:** Creatures that evolved for these conditions, as strange as the plane itself
- **Mortal context:** Evidence of visitors—their smallness, their wonder, their fear

### Plane Integration (Planes Are Concepts Made Reality)
Every element should express the plane's fundamental nature and difference from mortality:
- *Don't write:* "hellish landscape" → *Write:* "the Eighth Hell, where the concept of punishment has become geography—rivers of the tears of the damned carving canyons through stone that was once bone, the sky the color of bruises, the air carrying screams that have become wind, the heat not from fire but from concentrated suffering"
- *Don't write:* "fairy realm" → *Write:* "the Summerlands where the fey court, where time moves like honey and colors exist that mortal eyes have no names for, where the trees grow music and the rivers flow laughter, where beauty becomes so concentrated it hurts—and the mortal visitor realizes they are fading, becoming colorful themselves, being absorbed into the realm's endless dream"
- *Don't write:* "elemental fire plane" → *Write:* "the plane where fire is not energy but substance, where flames form mountains and infernos become seas, where the very concept of 'not burning' is foreign—the air is fire that breathes into lungs, the ground is fire that takes the shape of stone, the native salamanders swimming through heat as fish swim through water"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Planes
- **Physical law violations:** How this plane breaks the rules—floating rocks, reversed gravity, visible time
- **Essence saturation:** The plane's nature in everything—a chaos plane where even stone is uncertain
- **Sensory impossibility:** Colors, sounds, and feelings that can't exist in the Material world
- **Native adaptation:** Creatures evolved for these conditions, as strange as their environment
- **Mortal vulnerability:** How unprepared visitors suffer or struggle
- **Cosmic geography:** Landscapes that follow alien logic—where up and down are suggestions rather than laws

### Planar Landscape
The plane revealed—reality operating under different rules.

**Template:**
> [Plane in its nature—e.g., "the Storm Eternal, the plane where tempest is not weather but reality, where the concept of calm has never existed and never could"]. [Physical impossibility—e.g., "a vista where lightning is landscape—bolts frozen in place forming mountains, thunder solidified into bridges, rain that falls upward as often as down, the colors of the storm-sky bleeding into everything until purple and grey are the only shades that exist"]. [Terrain character—e.g., "the 'ground' of compressed cloud that supports weight but shifts underfoot, the canyons carved by thunder-rivers, the peaks of crystallized lightning where the storm-giants built their citadels before they died"]. [Native life—e.g., "creatures of living storm visible in the distance—the tempest-wyrms swimming through air thick as water, the spark-swarms dancing between lightning-peaks, the howling wind-spirits that are the plane's closest thing to wildlife"]. [Atmospheric strangeness—e.g., "the 'sky' that's just more storm in every direction, the sensation of static electricity making hair stand and metal hum, the taste of ozone so thick it's almost solid, the sound of thunder so constant it becomes silence"]. [Mortal reference—e.g., "a mortal explorer visible at the scene's edge, wrapped in magical protection that flickers with every nearby strike, their form tiny against the scale of eternal storm, their face showing the particular awe of encountering a reality that doesn't need them to exist"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the overwhelming presence of a plane that embodies a single concept utterly, where storm is not something that happens but something that IS"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on otherworldly environments and alien features, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy storm plane illustration" or "Fantasy elemental plane landscape"].

**Prompt:**


### Portal/Access Point
The doorway between worlds—the moment of transition made visible.

**Template:**
> [Portal with purpose—e.g., "the Gate of Storms, the permanent portal that's connected the Valdren kingdom to the Storm Eternal since the arch-mage Valdren the Bold bound it open three centuries ago"]. [Portal form—e.g., "a ring of standing stones struck by lightning so often they've fused into glass, the space between them a perpetual vortex of cloud and spark, the boundary between Material reality and eternal tempest visible as a shimmer where physics changes"]. [View through—e.g., "through the portal, the Storm Eternal visible—not the familiar sky-blue of mortal storms but the purple-grey that is all that plane knows, lightning visible as landscape, the howl of wind audible even from this side"]. [Material side—e.g., "the portal-ground a hilltop struck by sympathetic lightning so often that grass won't grow, the guardian towers built by mages who spend their lives regulating what comes through, the warning stones marking the distance beyond which unprotected mortals feel the plane's pull"]. [Transition evidence—e.g., "a storm-touched bird flying through from the other side, its feathers crackling with power it can't discharge in normal reality; an expedition party in full protective gear approaching the gate, their faces showing the mix of fear and determination that planar travel requires"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular tension of a place where two realities meet, where normal physics fails at the edges, where stepping forward means leaving everything familiar behind"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy planar portal illustration" or "Fantasy gate between worlds scene"].
