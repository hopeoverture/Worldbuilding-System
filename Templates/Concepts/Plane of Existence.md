> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a plane of existence, create an alternate reality with its own rules, inhabitants, and hazards. Consider how the plane's nature differs from the Material Plane, who lives there, how to reach it, and what draws visitors despite its dangers. Planes should feel like coherent realms with their own logic—places where the normal rules don't apply.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this plane's essential nature—what kind of realm it is, how it differs from the Material Plane, who inhabits it, and why it matters to mortals.
