> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a prophecy, create a prediction that drives plot and creates tension through ambiguity. Include the prophecy text itself, multiple interpretations, and signs of fulfillment. Prophecies should be specific enough to seem meaningful but ambiguous enough to support multiple outcomes—creating opportunities for both hope and dread among those who know of them.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this prophecy's significance—what it predicts, who believes it, its age and source, and why it matters to the present.
