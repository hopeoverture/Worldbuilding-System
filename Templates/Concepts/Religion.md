### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on religious iconography and sacred spaces, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this religion, include:
- **Theological architecture:** Spaces designed to create religious experience—height inspiring awe, darkness creating mystery, light suggesting revelation
- **Living practice:** Clergy and worshippers engaged in actual devotion, not empty ritual but genuine faith
- **Accumulated devotion:** The marks of generations—worn stones, smoke-stained ceilings, polished surfaces where hands have touched in prayer
- **Hierarchical clarity:** Vestments, positions, and architecture revealing the structure of sacred authority
- **Symbol saturation:** The religion's emblems appearing naturally throughout—carved, painted, woven, cast
- **Transcendent moments:** The instances where the mundane seems to touch the divine

### Religion Integration (Religions Are Community Made Sacred)
Every element should express the faith's beliefs and the lives shaped by devotion:
- *Don't write:* "priests at altar" → *Write:* "the morning service at the high altar, the bishop in vestments that have been worn by twenty predecessors, the deacons in their ranked positions, the choir's voices rising through air thick with incense—a ceremony performed the same way every day for five centuries, each word a thread connecting present worshippers to every soul who has ever prayed here"
- *Don't write:* "temple interior" → *Write:* "the nave of the cathedral stretching upward until the ceiling disappears into shadows and candlesmoke, the pillars carved with scenes from the scriptures that educated generations who couldn't read, the light through stained glass painting the congregation in the colors of holy stories, the particular hush of a space where generations have been taught that god listens"
- *Don't write:* "religious symbol" → *Write:* "the wheel of the Eternal Cycle worn smooth by the prayers of ten thousand petitioners, each spoke representing a spoke of existence, the hub the divine center from which all meaning flows—carved in wood from the sacred grove, small enough to fit in a palm, powerful enough to focus a lifetime of devotion"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Religions
- **Ritual infrastructure:** Altars, fonts, lecterns, and implements that enable worship
- **Devotion evidence:** Candles burned to stubs, offerings accumulated, the marks of regular practice
- **Community gathering:** Congregations in worship, the social reality of shared faith
- **Sacred calendar:** Decorations, vestments, or activities marking religious seasons
- **Hierarchy visibility:** Who stands where, who wears what, the structure of religious authority
- **Transcendence architecture:** How the space creates religious feeling—light, height, acoustics, progression

### Temple/Sacred Space
The faith made architectural—where community meets the divine.

**Template:**
> [Sacred space with identity—e.g., "the Cathedral of the Eternal Flame, mother church of the faith that's shaped this kingdom's conscience for seven centuries, where kings are crowned and the poor are fed in equal measure"]. [Architectural theology—e.g., "built when the faith was young and ambitious, the walls of white stone chosen for purity, the soaring ceiling drawing eyes upward toward heaven, the windows positioned so the dawn light strikes the high altar at the moment of the morning prayer—architecture as sermon"]. [Living worship—e.g., "the faithful gathered for the dawn service, the pews filled with noble and commoner in the democracy of prayer, the choir singing the ancient hymns that every child learns, the incense rising in smoke that carries prayers upward—or so the faithful believe"]. [Sacred focus—e.g., "the high altar of gilded stone beneath the eternal flame that's burned for seven centuries, the bishops in cloth-of-gold arranging the sacred vessels, the morning light beginning to touch the altar as the service reaches its peak"]. [Accumulated history—e.g., "the walls bearing memorial tablets for those who served the faith, the side chapels added by grateful nobles, the floor worn in paths where feet have walked to communion for generations, the wood of the pews polished by bodies of worshippers beyond counting"]. [Transcendent atmosphere—e.g., "the particular quality of light through stained glass, the sound of voices rising in stone spaces designed for them, the smell of incense and old wood, the sense that something listens in spaces consecrated by centuries of belief"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on religious iconography and sacred spaces, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy cathedral interior illustration" or "Fantasy religious service scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Holy Symbol/Icon
The faith made portable—belief concentrated in sacred objects.

**Template:**
> [Symbol with history—e.g., "the Sunburst of the Radiant Path, the symbol that's been worn over hearts and placed in homes across the kingdom since the faith's founding vision three centuries ago"]. [Physical form—e.g., "a sixteen-pointed sun in gold—real gold for the wealthy, gilded bronze for the common folk, carved wood for the poor, but all the same design, all blessed by the same words, all carrying the same meaning"]. [Craftsmanship—e.g., "this example the work of temple goldsmiths, the rays delicate but strong, the face of the sun bearing features that suggest the Radiant Lord without presuming to depict divine perfection, the back inscribed with the core prayer in script too small to read with mortal eyes"]. [Sacred significance—e.g., "worn on a golden chain that's been kissed at every prayer for forty years, the face of the sun worn smooth by fingers that have touched it in hope and fear and gratitude beyond counting, the particular patina that comes from being the center of someone's spiritual life"]. [Context—e.g., "resting on a velvet pillow in the light of a stained glass window, the colored light falling across it, the altar beneath it, the chapel around it quiet between services"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the sense that this small object is a node in a vast network of belief, one point of light in a constellation of faith, unremarkable and profound at once"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on religious iconography and sacred spaces, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy religious symbol illustration" or "Fantasy holy icon close-up"].
