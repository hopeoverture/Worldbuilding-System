### Natural Behavior Integration (Show the Animal's Life)
Every detail should reveal how this creature lives:

- *Don't write:* "alert ears" → *Write:* "tall ears swiveling independently, the left tracking something behind while the right points forward, veins visible in the thin skin backlit by morning sun, small nicks and tears along the edges from years of thorny passage"
- *Don't write:* "standing in field" → *Write:* "paused mid-graze in a meadow of knee-high grass, head raised and jaw still working the last mouthful, legs positioned for instant flight, a study in prey-animal readiness"

### Individual Character (Animals Have Stories Too)

- Scars from predator encounters or territorial disputes
- Age indicators in wear patterns, greying muzzle, clouded eyes
- Condition reflecting season and food availability
- Personality in body language—bold, wary, curious, tired
