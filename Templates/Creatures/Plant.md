> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a plant, create a species with distinctive appearance, ecological role, and practical applications. Consider where it grows, what makes it useful or dangerous, and how cultures interact with it. Plants should feel like authentic parts of the world's ecosystem—with clear growth patterns, harvesting requirements, and meaningful impact on those who seek them.

## Overview
> Write 2-3 sentences establishing this plant's identity—what it is, where it grows, its most notable property, and why people might seek it or avoid it.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on botanical features and natural environments, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this plant, include:
- **Growth Form:** Complete structure from root to crown
- **Life Stage:** Showing maturity level and seasonal state
- **Distinctive Features:** What makes this plant unique and identifiable
- **Scale:** Size reference for unusual plants
- **Environment:** Natural habitat and growing conditions
- **Atmosphere:** The mood this plant evokes (serene, dangerous, mystical)

### Botanical Detail Integration (Plants Have Character Too)
Every feature should suggest the plant's nature and uses:
- *Don't write:* "purple flowers" → *Write:* "clusters of deep violet flowers with petals like velvet, each blossom nodding on a threadlike stem, the purple darkening to near-black at the center where the stigma emerges like a reaching finger—beautiful and somehow unsettling, the color of bruises and twilight"
- *Don't write:* "thorny stem" → *Write:* "a stem armored with thorns arranged in defensive spirals, each thorn curved like a cat's claw and tipped with darker red as if dipped in old blood, the plant's solution to the deer that would otherwise devour it in a single meal"
- *Don't write:* "large leaves" → *Write:* "broad leaves the size of dinner plates, veined like stained glass windows, the upper surface waxy and dark while the underside is pale and fuzzy with minute hairs that trap morning dew and funnel it to the roots"

### Magical/Dangerous Plant Features
For fantasy plants, emphasize the otherworldly:
- Bioluminescence or unusual glow
- Movement or reaction suggesting awareness
- Visual indicators of magical properties (shimmering, color-shifting)
- Warning patterns for dangerous species
- Signs of harvest or cultivation if used by sentient beings

### Plant Portrait
Detailed botanical illustration showing the complete plant.

**Template:**
> [Plant name] depicted in [style—e.g., "detailed botanical illustration style against a neutral background" or "naturalistic setting showing wild growth"]. [Complete structure—e.g., "the full plant visible from the twisted root system that grips between stones, through the thick succulent stem, to the crown of silver-grey leaves and the single dramatic flower"]. [Root system if visible—e.g., "roots exposed where erosion has undercut the bank, showing the taproot thick as a wrist driving deep for water, surrounded by a web of smaller feeders spread wide for nutrients"]. [Stem/trunk with character—e.g., "the main stem woody and ancient despite the plant's annual flowers, bark rough and grey like weathered stone, small lichens growing in the crevices suggesting decades of growth"]. [Leaves with detail—e.g., "leaves arranged in opposite pairs along the stem, each leaf oval and thick with a waxy coating, deep green above and silver-furred below, the margins toothed with tiny points that catch the light"]. [Flowers/fruit with beauty—e.g., "a single large flower at the apex, five petals of deep crimson shading to black at the base, arranged around a crown of golden stamens heavy with pollen; three unopened buds below showing the progression of bloom"]. [Magical elements if applicable—e.g., "a faint shimmer around the flower suggesting magical potency, the pollen grains catching light in unnatural ways, the whole plant seeming to exist slightly outside normal rules of light and shadow"]. [Scale reference—e.g., "a common songbird perched on one branch for scale, showing the plant stands about knee-high"]. [Lighting—e.g., "soft diffused light showing color accurately, slight shadows emphasizing the three-dimensional structure"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on botanical features and natural environments, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy healing herb botanical illustration" or "Fantasy carnivorous plant portrait"].

### Growth Environment
The plant shown in its natural habitat with ecological context.

**Template:**
> [Plant name] in natural habitat, [environmental specifics—e.g., "growing in the perpetual twilight of the deep forest floor, where little light reaches through the canopy above"]. [Growth pattern—e.g., "three specimens visible at different life stages—a seedling just emerging from the leaf litter, an adolescent plant with its first leaves, and a mature specimen in full flower, showing the progression of a decade of growth"]. [Associated plants—e.g., "surrounded by the expected companions of this ecosystem: soft moss carpeting the ground, shelf fungi on the nearby fallen log, the reaching tendrils of a climbing vine that wisely avoids the specimen plant"]. [Wildlife interaction—e.g., "a specialized moth hovering at the flower, the only pollinator with a tongue long enough to reach the nectar, caught in the moment of approach; nearby a slug shows the symptoms of having tasted the toxic leaves—nature's warning to others"]. [Harvest evidence if applicable—e.g., "careful cuts visible on the lower stems where an herbalist has harvested sustainably, taking some but not all, the plant recovering from the attention"]. [Atmospheric conditions—e.g., "morning mist drifting between the specimens, moisture beading on every surface, the particular humidity that this plant requires"]. [Environmental mood—e.g., "the scene carrying a sense of ancient patience, the slow time of plants, the quiet of a place humans rarely visit"]. [Lighting—e.g., "diffused light from an overcast sky filtering through leaves above, catching the moisture and making every surface glow softly"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on botanical features and natural environments, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy rare herb natural habitat illustration" or "Fantasy magical forest floor scene"].
