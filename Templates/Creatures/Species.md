## Image Prompts

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, features, clothing, and cultural elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this species, include:
- **Physical Features:** Distinctive species traits that set them apart
- **Variation:** Show diversity within the species (subraces, regional variations)
- **Cultural Elements:** Clothing, jewelry, equipment, body modifications
- **Expression:** Personality and emotion appropriate to species temperament
- **Setting:** Cultural context or adventure setting
- **Lighting:** Dramatic lighting emphasizing unique features

### Species Distinctiveness (Make Them Alien Yet Relatable)
Every feature should show how this species differs from humans while remaining emotionally readable:
- *Don't write:* "pointed ears" → *Write:* "tall elegant ears rising above the crown, the tips as expressive as human eyebrows—currently swept back in wary attention, the delicate cartilage mapped with visible blood vessels showing centuries of careful listening"
- *Don't write:* "green skin" → *Write:* "deep forest-green skin with subtle variations in saturation like sun-dappled leaves, darker in the hollows and lighter over the cheekbones, small ceremonial scars on the chin showing clan marks in pale jade"
- *Don't write:* "large eyes" → *Write:* "eyes too large for a human face but perfect for this, irises of molten gold covering most of the visible surface, pupils dilating with emotion rather than light alone, reflecting centuries of starlight in depths that suggest they remember every moment they've seen"

### Cultural Integration (Clothing and Adornment Tell Stories)
Species culture should be visible in every detail:
- Fabrics and materials unique to their homeland
- Jewelry with cultural significance
- Hair/body styling reflecting tradition
- Practical adaptations for their environment
- Marks of status, achievement, or devotion

### Portrait (Bust)
Individual member showing distinctive features and personality.

**Template:**
> Portrait bust of a [species] [role/class], [gender], [age with species-relevant description—e.g., "young for an elf, perhaps a century and a half, still bearing the openness of youth in the eyes" or "elderly for a halfling, sixty winters marked in laugh-lines and grey curls"]. [Species-specific facial structure with detail—e.g., "the angular features characteristic of the wood elves, cheekbones sharp enough to seem carved, chin coming to a point that would look severe on a human but reads as elegant here; skin the color of polished birch bark with warmer tones at the cheeks and ears"]. [Distinctive species features—e.g., "tall swept-back ears rising above the crown, the tips adorned with three small silver rings marking first hunt, first kill, first mercy; the ears currently canted forward in interest, as mobile as a cat's and twice as expressive"]. [Eyes with species character—e.g., "almond-shaped eyes of deep amber with no visible whites, vertical pupils currently relaxed to circles, the eyes holding the patient focus of a hunter at rest—inhuman and yet readable, warm despite their strangeness"]. [Hair with cultural elements—e.g., "long silver-white hair worn in the warrior's knot of the northern clans, three braids pulled back from the face and bound with leather and bone beads, each bead carved with a deed-mark; loose strands framing the face softening the severity"]. [Expression with species temperament—e.g., "expression of quiet amusement and ancient patience, the look of someone who has learned that most problems solve themselves if you simply wait long enough"]. [Cultural attire—e.g., "wearing the layered leather and living-leaf armor of the forest wardens, green and brown in patterns that would blur to invisibility in the woods, a silver clan-pin at the collar marking status, the edges of tattoo-work visible at the neck suggesting extensive body art beneath"]. [Background—e.g., "blurred forest edge at twilight, the kinds of shadows an elf would find comfortable and humans would find menacing"]. [Lighting—e.g., "dappled green-gold light filtering through unseen leaves, catching the metallic elements and making the eyes glow"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, features, clothing, and cultural elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy wood elf ranger portrait" or "Fantasy dwarven noble portrait"].

**Prompt:**


### Cultural Scene
Group or individual in cultural context showing species society.

**Template:**
> [Species context—e.g., "A gathering of dwarven smiths in their mountain hall"]. [Number and variety—e.g., "five dwarves ranging from a young apprentice still with red in his beard to a master smith whose beard is solid grey and braided with clan-chains, showing the span of a career in metalwork"]. [Cultural setting with detail—e.g., "the Great Forge of Clan Steelheart, a natural cavern shaped by generations of careful work, the ceiling lost in shadow above while the forge-light illuminates everything below; ancestor-statues carved into the walls watching over the work, each one a former master whose techniques are still used"]. [Traditional elements—e.g., "all wearing the heavy leather aprons and arm-guards of the forge, bare arms showing the burn-scars that are marks of honor, beards braided back for safety but each in different clan-styles, heavy boots and heat-resistant leggings"]. [Activity—e.g., "gathered around the great anvil for the ceremonial first-strike on a blade that has been three years in the making, the master's hammer raised, the apprentice working the bellows, others holding tongs and watching with the intensity of those who know they witness history"]. [Cultural details—e.g., "runes carved into every tool and surface, ale-mugs waiting on a stone bench for the break that follows, the clan-banner hanging from the ceiling with battle-honors marked in gold thread, the forge itself decorated with scenes of legendary craftings"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the heat visible as shimmer, the glow of the forge playing over faces and beards, metal cooling on side tables in stages of completion, the sense of industry and tradition and reverence for craft"]. [Lighting—e.g., "warm forge-light from below casting dramatic uplight on faces, cooler reflected light from the surrounding stone, the whole scene a play of fire and shadow"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, features, clothing, and cultural elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy dwarven forge ceremony illustration" or "Fantasy elven council gathering illustration"].
