> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a combat encounter, create a tactically interesting fight with balanced opposition, environmental elements, and clear stakes. Use the D&D 5e (2024) XP budget system: Low/Moderate/High difficulty replaces Easy/Medium/Hard/Deadly. Consider creature synergies, terrain advantages, and victory conditions beyond "kill all enemies."

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on combatants and battlefield, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this combat encounter, include:
- **Moment of decision:** The instant before an attack lands, a spell releases, or a critical choice is made—tension at its peak
- **Tactical reality:** Positioning that matters—cover being used, flanking in progress, terrain advantages visible
- **Violence as consequence:** The weight of combat—exhaustion, wounds, the cost of fighting visible on every participant
- **Enemy character:** Opponents as more than targets—intelligence, fear, determination visible in their faces and stances
- **Environmental interaction:** The battlefield being used, changed, and reacted to—not just a backdrop but a participant
- **Party dynamics:** How the adventurers work together visible in their positions, their awareness of each other, their complementary actions

### Combat Encounter Integration (Combat Is Survival Made Immediate)
Every element should express the fight's stakes, its chaos, and its tactical reality:
- *Don't write:* "fighters in battle" → *Write:* "the moment the shield wall buckles—the knight's desperate brace against the ogre's club, the splinter pattern spreading across wood that has held through a dozen blows, the particular expression of someone whose strength is failing while her courage holds, the fighter beside her already adjusting stance to cover the gap that's about to open"
- *Don't write:* "wizard casting fireball" → *Write:* "the three-count heartbeat before the fire blooms—the wizard's hands completing the final gesture while goblins realize too late what the words mean, the orange glow already visible in her eyes, the party members flattening against walls they hope are far enough, the epicenter of the coming explosion framed by enemies still charging forward"
- *Don't write:* "rogue attacking" → *Write:* "the blade finding the gap in armor that shouldn't exist—the assassin materializing from shadow with the strike already in motion, the orc's expression shifting from battle-rage to the confusion of his own mortality, the rogue's eyes already finding her next target because she knows this one is done even if he hasn't fallen yet"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Combat Encounters
- **Violence markers:** Blood, wounds, broken equipment, the physical evidence of fighting
- **Fatigue reality:** Sweat, heavy breathing, the postures of combatants who have been fighting for rounds
- **Tactical positioning:** Who has cover, who is flanked, who controls the chokepoint
- **Magic in combat:** Spells as they look mid-cast, mid-flight, mid-impact—the visual chaos of magical warfare
- **Equipment in use:** Shields catching blows, weapons mid-swing, armor deflecting what would have killed
- **Emotional spectrum:** Terror, rage, determination, desperation—the faces of people fighting for their lives

### Battle Scene
The combat at its peak—violence in motion.

**Template:**
> [The decisive moment—e.g., "the instant the cleric's hammer connects with the undead champion's skull, the turning point of a battle that hung in the balance for six brutal rounds"]. [The combatants—e.g., "the cleric bloodied from wounds that would have killed a lesser warrior, her holy symbol blazing with light that burns the darkness, the undead champion's ancient armor cracking under divine judgment, his unholy flames guttering as the hammer falls"]. [Party visible—e.g., "the fighter shield-blocking three skeletons so the cleric could reach their master, the wizard's protective spell flickering around them both, the rogue flanking a wight that doesn't know it's already dead"]. [Battlefield reality—e.g., "the crypt littered with the twice-dead, the altar that spawned them cracked by the paladin's sacrifice three rounds ago, the tactical geometry of a fight that required every party member doing exactly what they do best"]. [Combat atmosphere—e.g., "dust and bone fragments suspended in the air, holy light clashing with necrotic darkness, the sound that exists between hammer and skull—the moment before victory or defeat"]. [Stakes visible—e.g., "the innocent hostages in the corner the party is fighting toward, the narrowing window before the ritual completes, everything that makes this fight matter"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on combatants and battlefield, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy undead combat illustration" or "Fantasy holy warrior battle scene"].

### Battlefield Overview
The arena of violence—terrain as tactical reality.

**Template:**
> [Battlefield with purpose—e.g., "the bridge over the lava flow where the party must hold against the salamander raiding party, every feature of the terrain chosen by whoever designed this encounter to matter"]. [Tactical elements—e.g., "the broken pillar that provides three-quarters cover from the far side, the heat shimmer that imposes disadvantage on ranged attacks across the channel, the narrow bridge width that means only two combatants can engage at once, the side ledge that a clever rogue might use to flank"]. [Enemy positions—e.g., "salamanders arrayed on the far shore with fire lances ready, their war-beast circling the magma looking for a crossing point, their shaman already beginning the spell that will make the bridge too hot to stand on"]. [Party approach—e.g., "the point where the party must decide—charge the bridge and control the chokepoint, or find another way across and risk being picked apart by fire lances, the tactical problem that makes this more than just a fight"]. [Environmental hazards—e.g., "the lava that deals 10d10 fire damage to anyone who falls, the ancient bridge that might not hold the fighter in full plate, the heat that saps Constitution with every round of exposure"]. [Atmospheric tension—e.g., "the orange glow that makes everything hellish, the sulfur smell that means fire and death, the moment before the battle begins when both sides are still calculating"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on combatants and battlefield, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy lava bridge battlemap illustration" or "Fantasy tactical combat terrain scene"].
