> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a social encounter, create a meaningful interaction with clear stakes, NPC motivations, and multiple resolution paths. Use the D&D 5e (2024) Influence action rules: NPCs have attitudes (Friendly/Indifferent/Hostile) and can be Willing/Hesitant/Unwilling to comply. Skill checks only occur when NPCs are Hesitant. Default DC is 15 or the NPC's Intelligence score, whichever is higher.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on characters and expressions, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this social encounter, include:
- **Words as weapons:** The tension of verbal combat visible in body language, expression, and positioning
- **Power dynamics:** Who holds advantage, who needs something, who is performing confidence they don't feel
- **Subtext made visible:** What people really mean showing through what they actually say—the tells, the masks, the moments of truth
- **Environmental staging:** Settings chosen to reinforce power or undermine it, witness presence that changes what can be said
- **Stakes in expression:** Fear, hope, calculation, and desperation visible in faces and postures
- **Social armor:** The clothing, positioning, and props that people use to project the image they want perceived

### Social Encounter Integration (Social Encounters Are Battles Fought With Words)
Every element should express the encounter's tension, its stakes, and its complexity:
- *Don't write:* "negotiation in throne room" → *Write:* "the audience where one wrong word ends in execution—the queen on her throne positioned to look down on supplicants, the adventurers trying to appear confident while surrounded by guards who would kill them on a gesture, the particular tension of a conversation where everyone knows the stakes but no one can acknowledge them aloud"
- *Don't write:* "merchant bargaining" → *Write:* "the negotiation where both sides need something they cannot admit to needing—the merchant's casual posture hiding calculation of exactly how desperate these adventurers are, the party's affected indifference masking the knowledge that they cannot afford to walk away, the dance of prices that is really a dance of information and leverage"
- *Don't write:* "interrogation scene" → *Write:* "the questioning where lies and truth are equally dangerous—the prisoner deciding each second what to reveal and what to conceal, the interrogator parsing every word for the truth hiding behind it, the particular atmosphere of a room where both parties know that what happens next depends entirely on what is said in the next few minutes"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Social Encounters
- **Eye contact dynamics:** Who meets whose gaze, who looks away, who stares without blinking
- **Physical positioning:** Distance that signals intimacy or threat, elevation that establishes dominance, orientation that shows alliance or opposition
- **Gesture language:** Hands that reveal nervousness, calculated stillness, movements that underline words or contradict them
- **Environmental power:** Furniture arranged to advantage, lighting that flatters or intimidates, witnesses whose presence changes everything
- **Status displays:** Clothing, jewelry, and accessories that project power, wealth, or humility (genuine or performed)
- **Tension markers:** Sweat, forced smiles, hands near weapons, the physical evidence of stress in what appears civilized

### The Negotiation
Words as weapons—verbal combat in progress.

**Template:**
> [Social confrontation at its peak—e.g., "the moment the guild master realizes the adventurers know about the smuggling operation, the instant when the conversation transforms from polite fiction to dangerous truth"]. [The parties—e.g., "the guild master behind his ornate desk, smile still fixed but eyes gone cold, fingers that were steepled in welcome now flat on wood where weapons could be hidden beneath; the party's face, the bard whose charm has gotten them this far, maintaining the pleasant expression while calculating escape routes"]. [Power dynamics visible—e.g., "the guards who entered 'coincidentally' after the bard's last observation, the merchant's assistant who has stopped writing and started watching, the shift in atmosphere from negotiation to confrontation"]. [Environmental staging—e.g., "the office designed to impress and intimidate, the guild master's chair elevated just enough to force visitors to look up, the portrait of his predecessor who died mysteriously, the door that suddenly seems very far away"]. [Stakes made manifest—e.g., "the contract on the desk that proves everything, the bell that could summon more guards, the window behind the guild master that a desperate person might use"]. [The moment itself—e.g., "the three seconds of silence while both sides realize the game has changed, the negotiation over, something else beginning"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on characters and expressions, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy guild negotiation illustration" or "Fantasy tense conversation scene"].

**Prompt:**


### The NPC
The social adversary—complexity in a single face.

**Template:**
> [NPC as fully realized character—e.g., "the guild master in the moment before the mask slips, the accumulated weight of a lifetime visible in a single expression"]. [Physical presence—e.g., "a man who has grown into his power, corpulent where he was once lean, the merchant's rings cutting into fingers that have become too prosperous, the smile that convinces because he has been practicing it for thirty years"]. [Expression complexity—e.g., "the particular look of someone deciding whether these strangers are a threat or an opportunity, calculation and charm fighting for control of his features, the eyes that give away what the mouth conceals"]. [Status manifestation—e.g., "robes cut to make him look larger than he is, the guild medallion that is also a key to several locked doors, the cane he doesn't need but carries because his predecessor carried one, the conscious performance of prosperity"]. [Setting integration—e.g., "seated in the chair from which he has made a thousand deals, surrounded by the trophies of a career built on knowing more than the person across the desk, lit by the lamp that casts his face in shadow while illuminating visitors"]. [Character depth—e.g., "the suggestion of the young man he was in the set of his jaw, the tiredness around his eyes that suggests he has played this game too long, the awareness that every meeting might be the one where his luck runs out"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on characters and expressions, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy merchant portrait illustration" or "Fantasy NPC character study"].
