> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a social encounter, create a meaningful interaction with clear stakes, NPC motivations, and multiple resolution paths. Use the D&D 5e (2024) Influence action rules: NPCs have attitudes (Friendly/Indifferent/Hostile) and can be Willing/Hesitant/Unwilling to comply. Skill checks only occur when NPCs are Hesitant. Default DC is 15 or the NPC's Intelligence score, whichever is higher.
