> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a cave, create a natural underground environment with distinctive geological features, atmospheric conditions, and ecological systems. Consider the cave's formation, what resources it contains, who or what inhabits it, and its significance to nearby settlements. Caves should feel like believable geological formations with hazards and rewards appropriate to their depth and type.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on rock formations and cave features, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this cave, include:
- **Geological formations:** Stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, crystals, columns, cave pearls
- **Light and darkness:** The contrast between illuminated areas and infinite black
- **Water presence:** Drips, pools, underground streams, reflections
- **Scale:** Formations dwarf humans, or claustrophobic tightness
- **Surface textures:** Wet stone, dry dust, crystalline growths, organic stains
- **Atmosphere:** Humidity visible, dust motes in light, the weight of stone above

### Cave Integration (Caves Are Underground Cathedrals)
Every element should suggest the alien beauty and danger of the underground:
- *Don't write:* "stalactites" → *Write:* "stone icicles descending from the ceiling in their patient thousands, each one the work of millennia of dripping water, some thin as fingers, others thick as pillars, the oldest meeting their stalagmite partners in columns that have grown together over geological ages"
- *Don't write:* "dark passage" → *Write:* "darkness beyond the torchlight so complete it seems solid, pressing against the sphere of illumination, waiting for the flame to fail—the passage continuing into that black unknown, sound swallowed, direction lost"
- *Don't write:* "underground pool" → *Write:* "water so still it seems like glass, the surface reflecting the cave ceiling in perfect detail, an inverted world of stone suspended above infinite depth—a pebble thrown in would shatter both images"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Caves
- **Formation variety:** cave bacon (thin wavy sheets), soda straws, helictites defying gravity, flowstone cascades frozen mid-flow
- **Light sources:** torch flames reflected in a thousand wet surfaces, bioluminescent organisms, crystals catching light, shafts from above
- **Water features:** drip echoes amplified, underground waterfalls heard before seen, rimstone pools stepping downward
- **Scale markers:** tiny figure against massive chamber, tight squeeze where only a human fits, columns taller than buildings
- **Life signs:** bat colonies on ceilings, cave-adapted creatures, ancient paintings, recent disturbance

### Cave Interior
The underground chamber showing formations, scale, and the particular beauty of geological time.

**Template:**
> [Chamber description—e.g., "the Great Hall of Crystals, where the ceiling rises beyond torchlight and the formations have grown undisturbed for a million years"]. [Formations in detail—e.g., "stalactites descending like frozen rain, some thin enough to ring when touched, others thick as a man's waist; stalagmites rising to meet them in organic shapes that suggest bones or trees or things with no surface name; flowstone cascading down one wall like a waterfall that stopped mid-motion ten thousand years ago"]. [Light quality—e.g., "torchlight catching the wet stone in a thousand reflections, every drip of moisture a tiny flame, crystals embedded in the walls throwing back colored sparks; beyond the light's reach, darkness absolute and patient"]. [Water presence—e.g., "a still pool in the chamber's low point, its surface mirror-perfect, reflecting the ceiling formations so completely that up and down lose meaning; the sound of dripping water echoing from somewhere deeper in the system"]. [Scale—e.g., "a human figure for reference, dwarfed by columns that rise sixty feet, standing on formations larger than houses, the scope of the chamber revealed in fragments as the torchlight moves"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the air cool and utterly still, carrying the mineral smell of wet stone and deep earth, so quiet that heartbeats seem loud, so dark beyond the light that imagination peoples the shadows"]. [Ceiling—e.g., "visible only in sections where formations hang—stalactites clustering in chandeliers of stone, cave curtains thin enough for light to pass through, the sense of weight above barely held back by geology"]. [Time presence—e.g., "every surface a record of deep time, each ring in the flowstone a century, each crystal a geological age—human presence momentary, the cave eternal"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on rock formations and cave features, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy cave crystal chamber illustration" or "Fantasy underground cavern exploration illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Entrance
The threshold between worlds—daylight meeting underground darkness.

**Template:**
> [Entrance type and location—e.g., "the cave mouth opening in a limestone cliff, a darker space in the pale rock face that the forest has grown up to hide"]. [Physical form—e.g., "an opening perhaps ten feet wide and twice that tall, water-worn smooth over millennia, the rock above jutting forward like a protective brow; ferns growing in the perpetual moisture, their fronds catching the light that the cave rejects"]. [Light transition—e.g., "daylight flooding the entrance zone, revealing tumbled boulders and the dust of ages; beyond, the twilight zone where light fades and colors drain; and beyond that, utter darkness waiting"]. [Signs of nature—e.g., "bat guano on the entrance rocks, the worn paths of animals coming to drink from the seep inside, the smooth stone where generations of visitors have passed"]. [Human marks—e.g., "a worn path leading to the entrance, old torch scars on the walls, carved symbols of warning or blessing at the threshold—evidence that others have stood here gathering courage"]. [Surrounding terrain—e.g., "the cliff rising above, the forest crowding close on either side, a stream emerging from the cave mouth and splashing down to join the larger river below"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "cool air flowing from the cave like breath, carrying the smell of deep earth and moisture, the temperature dropping noticeably at the threshold—the boundary between the world of sun and the world below"]. [Lighting—e.g., "late afternoon sun slanting through the forest, catching motes of dust at the cave mouth, the contrast between warm golden light outside and cold blue shadow within"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on rock formations and cave features, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy cave entrance wilderness illustration" or "Fantasy hidden cavern threshold illustration"].
