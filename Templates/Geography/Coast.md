> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a coast, create the dynamic meeting place of land and sea. Include the shoreline's character, the communities that depend on the sea, and the dangers and opportunities the coast presents. Coasts should feel like edges—places of transition, commerce, and the constant contest between earth and water.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this coast's character—its extent, the type of shoreline, and what makes it significant.
