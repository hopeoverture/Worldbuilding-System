> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a coast, create the dynamic meeting place of land and sea. Include the shoreline's character, the communities that depend on the sea, and the dangers and opportunities the coast presents. Coasts should feel like edges—places of transition, commerce, and the constant contest between earth and water.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this coast's character—its extent, the type of shoreline, and what makes it significant.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on waves, rocks, and atmospheric effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this coast, include:
- **Shore type:** Cliffs, beaches, rocks, dunes, marshes—each with unique character
- **Wave action:** How water meets land—crashing, lapping, surging, retreating
- **Tidal zones:** What high and low tide reveal, the zones between
- **Weather effects:** Salt spray, sea mist, storm surge, calm clarity
- **Human adaptation:** How settlements respond to the coast's challenges
- **Eternal contest:** The sense of land and sea in constant negotiation

### Coastal Integration (Coasts Are Battlegrounds)
Every element should suggest the dynamic meeting of land and sea:
- *Don't write:* "waves hitting rocks" → *Write:* "waves exploding against sea-stacks in white fury, spray thrown fifty feet into the air, the rock faces slick and black where the tide's constant assault has polished stone smooth and carved it into impossible shapes"
- *Don't write:* "beach" → *Write:* "sand the color of ground shells, arranged in wind-ridges above the tide line and wave-smoothed below, scattered with kelp and driftwood and the occasional treasure or tragedy the sea has surrendered"
- *Don't write:* "cliff coast" → *Write:* "sheer walls of striated stone rising two hundred feet from churning water, their faces carved by millennia of salt and storm into caves and arches and pillars, nesting seabirds wheeling against the rock face, their cries lost in the roar below"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Coasts
- **Erosion features:** sea stacks, arches, caves, undercut cliffs, collapsed blowholes
- **Tide marks:** the wet-dry line, zones of different life, tide pools with their miniature worlds
- **Weather presence:** storm waves, spray patterns, fog rolling in, the different character of windward and leeward shores
- **Life zones:** seabird colonies, seal haul-outs, intertidal creatures, shore vegetation bent by salt wind
- **Human marks:** lighthouses on headlands, harbors in coves, fish weirs, wrecks on rocks

### Coastal Vista
The dramatic meeting of land and sea, showing the coast's character and eternal contest.

**Template:**
> [Coast name with character—e.g., "the Widow's Shore, named for those who wait for ships that never return"]. [Shore type with drama—e.g., "cliffs of black basalt rising sheer from the churning water, their faces carved by ten thousand storms into walls of weathered columns, sea caves visible at their base where the waves boom and echo"]. [Wave action—e.g., "Atlantic swells that have built for a thousand miles spending themselves against the immovable stone, each impact an explosion of white foam, spray rising to catch the light like thrown diamonds"]. [Tidal zone—e.g., "at the cliff base, boulders fallen from above now worn to rounded shapes, encrusted with mussels and barnacles, tide pools forming in every depression, small worlds of anemone and crab"]. [Broader view—e.g., "the coastline stretching north and south in a jagged line of headlands and coves, each point taking its turn at deflecting the sea's assault, the water changing color from white foam to turquoise shallows to dark blue depths"]. [Sky and weather—e.g., "clouds building on the western horizon promising another blow, the present sun casting long shadows that emphasize every crevice and crack in the ancient stone, seabirds riding the updrafts along the cliff face"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "salt on everything—the air, the stone, the taste on the lips—the roar of breaking waves a constant voice, the smell of iodine and brine"]. [Time—e.g., "late afternoon light turning the spray to gold and the shadows to purple, the eternal rhythm of wave and rock continuing as it has since before humanity and will after"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on waves, rocks, and atmospheric effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy dramatic cliff coast illustration" or "Fantasy rugged shoreline landscape illustration"].

### Coastal Settlement
Human presence on the coast—adaptation to the demands of the sea.

**Template:**
> [Settlement type and location—e.g., "a fishing village built into the cliff face of a natural cove, the only shelter for thirty miles of rough coast"]. [Architecture adapting—e.g., "whitewashed houses with heavy slate roofs, their backs to the prevailing wind, built low to weather the storms that sweep in from the sea; a stone quay curving to create a harbor, generations of repair visible in the different colored stones"]. [Maritime activity—e.g., "fishing boats hauled up the slipway for the season's end, nets drying on frames, lobster pots stacked in readiness, the smell of tar and salt fish permeating everything"]. [Relationship to sea—e.g., "the harbor calm in the cove's shelter while beyond the breakwater waves still surge, the boundary between safety and danger marked by a line of foam"]. [Coast visible—e.g., "beyond the village, the cliffs resume their march up the coast, a lighthouse visible on the next headland, warning of the reef that has claimed so many"]. [Weather character—e.g., "sea mist beginning to roll in with the evening, softening the harsh lines of the coast, muffling sound, turning the lighthouse beam visible as it begins its rotation"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular quality of coastal evening, gulls crying, wind never quite still, the smell of the day's catch, the sound of the sea an eternal backdrop to human voices"]. [Lighting—e.g., "lamps being lit in windows as dusk deepens, their warm light reflecting off wet cobblestones, the last sun catching the upper cliffs while the village itself is in shadow"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on waves, rocks, and atmospheric effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy cliff-side fishing village illustration" or "Fantasy coastal harbor at dusk illustration"].
