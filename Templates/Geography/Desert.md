> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a desert, create a harsh environment of extremes—scorching days, freezing nights, and scarce water. Include the terrain variations, the hardy peoples and creatures that survive here, and the dangers that claim the unprepared. Deserts should feel unforgiving yet holding ancient secrets.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on sand and rock, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this desert, include:
- **Terrain type:** Dunes, rock, salt flat, canyon, mixed
- **Heat and light:** Shimmer, harsh shadows, bleached colors
- **Emptiness:** Vast scale, isolation, horizon stretch
- **Life adapted:** Sparse vegetation, animal signs, survivor features
- **Atmosphere:** Dust, haze, mirages, dry air clarity
- **Time effects:** Dramatic shadows, sunrise/sunset transformation

### Desert Integration (Deserts Are Not Empty)
Every feature should suggest both hostility and hidden life:
- *Don't write:* "sand dunes" → *Write:* "dunes like frozen waves in a copper sea, their crests razor-sharp where the morning wind sculpts them, the windward faces rippled with perfect geometry, the lee sides in shadow still cool from the night—every hour sees them shift imperceptibly, the desert remaking itself in patient silence"
- *Don't write:* "heat shimmer" → *Write:* "the air itself visible in the middle distance, dancing and distorting where the sun hammers the sand, turning distant rocks into floating islands, creating phantom lakes that recede forever—the desert's cruelest joke on the thirsty"
- *Don't write:* "rocky ground" → *Write:* "shattered rock baked to colors no northern eye would believe, ochre and rust and purple in striated layers, each stone sharp-edged and waiting, the spaces between them home to scorpions and the quick lizards that hunt them"

### Desert Landscape
The desert as a vast, alive, and deadly environment.

**Template:**
> Vast expanse of [desert name with character—e.g., "the Anvil, where empires go to die and gods go to forget"]. [Terrain with detail—e.g., "rolling dunes stretching to the horizon in every direction, each crest a blade of gold in the morning light, the troughs between them in deep purple shadow; occasional outcrops of dark volcanic rock jutting through the sand like the bones of buried giants"]. [Heat and light—e.g., "the sun a white disc in a sky bleached to near-colorlessness, the light so intense that shadows are almost black, the heat shimmer turning the middle distance into a wavering curtain of liquid air"]. [Signs of life—e.g., "the tracks of some night-wandering creature visible in the near dunes, already filling with wind-blown sand; a vulture circling high on the thermals, patient as only desert dwellers can be; in the far distance, the dark line of an acacia grove marking water somewhere below"]. [Scale and emptiness—e.g., "a human figure would be barely visible in this vastness, a mote against the dunes; the silence so complete that one's own heartbeat seems loud; the absence of landmark or shade or mercy"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the air dry enough to crack lips in hours, carrying the faint smell of baked stone and distant cedar smoke, dust rising from the dune crests in long streamers"]. [Time of day—e.g., "early morning when the desert is briefly gentle, long shadows providing the illusion of coolness, the sands not yet burning—the only hour when travel is wise"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on sand and rock, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy desert wasteland illustration" or "Fantasy dune sea landscape"].

**Prompt:**


### Oasis or Settlement
Life persisting in the desert—the precious exceptions.

**Template:**
> [Location with significance—e.g., "the Oasis of Seven Palms, waystation for caravans crossing the Burning Reach, fought over for three thousand years"]. [Water feature—e.g., "the spring bubbling up through white sand, spreading into a pool perhaps twenty feet across, impossibly clear, impossibly precious—the water that has made and broken fortunes, worth more than gold in this place"]. [Vegetation—e.g., "date palms rising around the pool like protective parents, their fronds rustling in a breeze that doesn't reach the desert floor, casting the only natural shade for fifty miles; beneath them oleander and tamarisk, and the impossible green of grass at the water's edge"]. [Human presence—e.g., "the caravanserai walls of mud-brick and palm-log, rebuilt a hundred times over the centuries, always in the same spot because the water dictates; travelers resting in the shade, their camels kneeling and drinking with the measured patience of animals who know thirst; a merchant checking his goods while a water-carrier fills goatskins"]. [Contrast—e.g., "beyond the circle of green, the desert waiting—dunes beginning where the palms end, the sand already encroaching on the eastern buildings, the eternal battle between life and desolation"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular quality of oasis air, still hot but somehow kinder, carrying the scent of water and green things and cooking food; the sound of birds and human voices after miles of wind and silence"]. [Lighting—e.g., "afternoon light filtering through the palms, dappled shadows on the pool, the desert beyond a blinding glare that makes the oasis feel like a dream"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on sand and rock, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy desert oasis refuge illustration"].
