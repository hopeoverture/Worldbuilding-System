> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a dungeon, create a dangerous adventure site with logical layout, coherent inhabitants, and meaningful treasure. Consider why the dungeon was built, who uses it now, and what challenges adventurers will face. Dungeons should tell a story through their design, with encounters that escalate appropriately and rewards that justify the risks.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this dungeon's identity—its type, current inhabitants, reputation, and what draws adventurers to risk its dangers.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on stonework and dungeon architecture, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this dungeon, include:
- **Architectural style:** Construction techniques, materials, decoration matching the builders
- **State of decay:** How time has treated the structure—collapse, overgrowth, recent use
- **Light and shadow:** The contest between illumination and darkness, pool of light in vast dark
- **Signs of inhabitants:** Fresh or ancient, predator or victim, organized or chaotic
- **Danger indicators:** Traps visible or hinted, damage from past conflicts, warning signs
- **Scale and oppression:** Low ceilings, vast halls, the weight of stone above

### Dungeon Integration (Dungeons Tell Stories)
Every element should suggest history, purpose, and the current threat:
- *Don't write:* "stone corridor" → *Write:* "a corridor cut from living rock with tools of precision long forgotten, the walls dressed smooth and carved with reliefs that once told stories now obscured by soot and time; the floor worn in the center where countless feet have passed"
- *Don't write:* "torchlight" → *Write:* "torchlight pushing back the darkness in a sphere of uncertain safety, catching details in the stonework—a face here, a symbol there—leaving everything beyond in darkness that seems to press back against the light"
- *Don't write:* "old bones" → *Write:* "bones scattered against the wall, still partially armored, the arrangement suggesting a last stand against something that came from deeper in; a sword rusted into uselessness nearby, shield splintered by tremendous force"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Dungeons
- **Builder evidence:** tool marks, architectural choices, decorative motifs, inscriptions in dead languages
- **Decay patterns:** selective collapse, water damage, root intrusion, areas mysteriously preserved
- **Occupant signs:** fresh torches in old sconces, new writing over old, makeshift repairs, sleeping areas
- **Danger hints:** blood stains old and new, claw marks, acid damage, the remains of previous explorers
- **Atmosphere builders:** dripping water, distant sounds, drafts suggesting passages, the smell of age and death

### Dungeon Interior
A chamber or corridor showing architecture, decay, and the threat of the unknown.

**Template:**
> [Location within dungeon—e.g., "the Processional Hall of the Tomb of the Hollow King, where priests once walked and now only the dead keep watch"]. [Architecture—e.g., "a corridor forty feet wide and twice that high, the ceiling lost in darkness above the reach of torchlight; massive columns carved as bound prisoners line both sides, their stone faces worn smooth by millennia but still expressing anguish; the floor a mosaic depicting a journey into the afterlife, most tiles still intact"]. [State of decay—e.g., "water damage has claimed the east wall, mineral deposits covering the carvings like frozen tears; the west wall remains pristine, protected by some quality of the stone or perhaps something else; dust thick enough to show footprints—not all of them human"]. [Light—e.g., "torchlight from the party catching the moisture on stone, creating reflections that suggest movement in peripheral vision; beyond the light, darkness so complete it seems to have substance, pressing in against the illumination"]. [Danger signs—e.g., "bones scattered in an alcove, too many to be one person, arranged in a pattern that might be ritual; a trap trigger visible in the floor tiles if one knows to look; scratches on a column at shoulder height, deep and parallel"]. [Current occupants—e.g., "cobwebs spanning the upper darkness speaking of spiders, but also of paths the spiders don't cross; a gnawed bone too fresh to have been here centuries; the sense of being watched from the darkness ahead and behind"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "cold air moving from somewhere deeper, carrying the smell of dust and incense and something that died recently; sound behaving strangely, echoing from unexpected directions; the weight of stone and age pressing down"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on stonework and dungeon architecture, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy ancient tomb corridor illustration" or "Fantasy dungeon exploration scene illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Entrance
The threshold of the dungeon—where the surface world ends and danger begins.

**Template:**
> [Entrance type and setting—e.g., "the main gates of the Fortress of Shadows, built into a cliff face where the mountains meet the wastes"]. [Physical form—e.g., "massive bronze doors green with verdigris, one hanging askew on ruined hinges, the other closed but not barred; the archway above carved with warnings in three languages, the stone itself seeming to recoil from whatever waits within"]. [Architectural details—e.g., "flanking towers crumbled to stumps, murder holes above the entrance long unused, the portcullis rusted open; the craftsmanship evident in what remains—this was built by masters, for defense against armies"]. [Signs of the dungeon's nature—e.g., "old bones scattered on the approach, picked clean and bleached; scorch marks on the stones around the entrance; more recent graffiti warning travelers away in several hands—and the scratches of something departing the dungeon, not entering"]. [Surrounding terrain—e.g., "the cliff rising above, the wasteland stretching away below, the ancient road that once led here now barely visible; no birds singing, no insects buzzing, the unnatural silence of a shunned place"]. [Weather and time—e.g., "storm clouds gathering overhead as if the dungeon summons them, the light dim and threatening, a cold wind blowing outward from the entrance as if the fortress exhales"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular dread of a threshold—safety behind, danger ahead, the point of commitment; the sense that whatever waits within is aware of visitors at the gate"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on stonework and dungeon architecture, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy fortress dungeon entrance illustration" or "Fantasy ancient tomb gateway illustration"].
