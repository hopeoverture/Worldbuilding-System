> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating hills, create rolling terrain that breaks the monotony of flatlands without the severity of mountains. Include the valleys between, the villages that dot the slopes, and the resources hidden within. Hills should feel pastoral or wild, depending on settlement—gentle country or bandit-haunted wilderness.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this hill region's character—its extent, the feel of the landscape, and what makes it notable.
