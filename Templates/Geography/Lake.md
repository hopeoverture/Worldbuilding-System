> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a lake, create a body of freshwater with its own character and significance. Include its shores, the settlements around it, the life within, and any mysteries it holds. Lakes should feel like focal points—centers of communities, sources of life, or places of hidden depths.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this lake's character—its size, the communities around it, and what makes it notable.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on water reflections and shores, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this lake, include:
- **Water character:** Stillness, reflections, color shifts with depth, surface disturbances
- **Shore relationship:** How land meets water, vegetation at the edge, beach or rock
- **Reflection quality:** Mirror-perfect or wind-rippled, what reflects and how
- **Depth suggestions:** Color changes, visible bottom or dark mystery
- **Surrounding landscape:** Mountains, forests, or plains framing the water
- **Human presence:** Boats, docks, settlements, fishing activity

### Lake Integration (Lakes Are Mirrors and Mysteries)
Every element should suggest the lake's character—its stillness, hidden depths, and role as focal point:
- *Don't write:* "calm water" → *Write:* "water so still it seems solid, a perfect mirror holding the inverted mountains and sky, the only movement the spreading rings where fish rise to insects, each ripple a violation of the perfect reflection that heals in seconds"
- *Don't write:* "dark water" → *Write:* "the shallows clear enough to see smooth stones on the bottom, but the color deepening from jade to emerald to near-black as the lakebed drops away, the depths as mysterious as the night sky"
- *Don't write:* "mist on the lake" → *Write:* "morning mist rising from water warmer than the air, soft white veils drifting across the surface, obscuring the far shore, parting around a rowboat to reveal and hide the fisherman in turns"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Lakes
- **Mirror effects:** perfect reflections at dawn, inverted landscapes, sky visible both above and below
- **Depth mystery:** dark water over unknown depths, color gradation revealing bottom contours, shadows of underwater features
- **Life signs:** fish jumping, ripples from unseen movement, herons frozen in the shallows, ducks in formation
- **Atmospheric moments:** mist rising, storm approaching across the water, first light or last light on the surface
- **Shore character:** rocky beaches, reedy margins, sandy coves, dock pilings, boats beached or moored

### Lake Vista
The lake in its landscape, showing scale, reflections, and the meeting of water and land.

**Template:**
> [Lake name with character—e.g., "the Mirror of Heaven, so called because on still days the gods might mistake it for the sky"]. [Water state—e.g., "the surface barely disturbed, the slightest breath of wind creating cat's-paw ripples that race across and die, the water itself shifting from pale blue in the shallows to deep green and finally to a mysterious darkness where the lake plunges to unsounded depths"]. [Reflections—e.g., "the surrounding mountains reflected so perfectly the image seems more real than reality, every snow-capped peak and dark pine inverted and trembling slightly with the water's breathing, clouds drifting through the underwater sky"]. [Shore detail—e.g., "near shore the water crystal clear over rounded stones worn smooth by centuries, reeds growing in sheltered coves, a narrow beach of pale sand where fishermen have drawn up their boats for generations"]. [Far shore—e.g., "the opposite bank a dark line of forest rising directly from the water two miles distant, a single column of smoke marking an invisible village, mountains rising beyond into morning haze"]. [Life—e.g., "a heron motionless in the shallows, fish breaking the surface with soft plops that send circular ripples expanding outward, the cry of a loon echoing off the surrounding heights"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular stillness of lakeland, sound carrying strangely across the water, the air fresh with the scent of water and pine"]. [Time and light—e.g., "first light catching the eastern peaks and painting them gold while the lake still holds the last blue of night, the boundary of day and shadow marching slowly across the water"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on water reflections and shores, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy mountain lake landscape illustration" or "Fantasy serene lake vista illustration"].

### Lakeside Scene
Human presence on the lake—settlements, activity, the life that water draws.

**Template:**
> [Location with specifics—e.g., "the fishing village of Deepwater nestled in the only natural harbor on the lake's eastern shore"]. [Architecture—e.g., "houses built on pilings extending over the water, their foundations wet at high water, docks jutting out like fingers reaching for the lake; smoke rising from cooking fires as the evening meal prepares; nets drying on frames, the tools of the lake-life everywhere"]. [Activity—e.g., "boats returning with the afternoon's catch, fishermen calling to children on the docks, a woman mending nets in the last good light, the day's rhythm winding toward rest"]. [Lake presence—e.g., "the water stretching away beyond the village, vast and patient, the far shore invisible in evening haze, the lake dwarfing the human settlement clinging to its edge"]. [Water interaction—e.g., "small waves lapping against pier posts, the reflection of lamplight beginning to appear as dusk deepens, a child throwing stones and watching the ripples spread"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular quality of lakeside evening, sound carrying clearly, the smell of fish and woodsmoke, the first stars appearing in both sky and water"]. [Lighting—e.g., "the golden hour making everything warm, long shadows stretching across the water, the western sky a palette of orange and purple reflected below"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on water reflections and shores, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy lakeside fishing village illustration" or "Fantasy lake settlement at dusk illustration"].
