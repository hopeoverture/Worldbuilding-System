> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a mountain range, create a dramatic natural barrier with distinct peaks, passes, and character. Include the geology, the peoples who live in or near the mountains, and the dangers they contain. Mountain ranges should feel imposing and consequential—shaping weather, trade, and politics.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on rock faces and snow, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this mountain range, include:
- **Scale:** Reference elements showing massive size (tiny trees, distant settlements)
- **Geology:** Specific rock types, formation patterns, erosion features
- **Weather:** Altitude-appropriate conditions (wind effects, cloud interactions)
- **Elevation zones:** Vegetation changes, snowline, treeline
- **Atmosphere:** Air quality at altitude (clarity, haze, thin air effects)
- **Time of day:** Alpenglow, shadow patterns, dramatic lighting angles

### Landscape Character Integration (Mountains Have Personality)
Every geological feature should suggest the mountain's nature and history:
- *Don't write:* "jagged peaks" → *Write:* "peaks thrust upward like broken teeth, the younger eastern range still sharp and defiant, the older western summits worn smooth by ten thousand years of wind and ice—geology as history"
- *Don't write:* "snow-capped" → *Write:* "eternal snowfields clinging to the upper reaches, wind-sculpted into impossible cornices and frozen waves, the lower edges stained grey with rockfall and the passage of time"
- *Don't write:* "mountain passes" → *Write:* "the ancient pass cutting through like a wound in the stone, the walls rising sheer on either side showing striations of colored rock—each layer a million years of patient accumulation, now exposed by the violence of uplift"

### Mountain Panorama
Vast landscape establishing the mountain range's character and scale.

**Template:**
> Dramatic panorama of [mountain range name with character—e.g., "the Spine of the World, an unbroken wall of stone that has divided civilizations since before recorded history"]. [Peak descriptions with variety—e.g., "the central massif rising higher than the rest, its three summits eternally crowned with snow, flanked by lesser peaks that would be mountains anywhere else; the eastern ridge dropping away in a series of shattered steps where ancient earthquakes tore the range apart"]. [Snow and ice—e.g., "eternal snowfields caught in the high cirques and couloirs, glaciers grinding slowly down the northern faces, their blue-white ice scarred with crevasses"]. [Weather—e.g., "cloud banners streaming from the highest peaks where the wind never rests, the sky above a blue so deep it hints at the void beyond"]. [Rock detail—e.g., "bare rock faces of grey granite and darker basalt, the striations of ancient geology visible even at this distance, scree fields spreading below the cliffs like frozen rivers of stone"]. [Vegetation zones—e.g., "the treeline visible as a ragged boundary, hardy conifers giving way to alpine meadows, then bare rock, then snow"]. [Scale reference—e.g., "in the middle distance, a fortress clings to a shoulder of rock, its towers barely visible, emphasizing the terrifying scale of the peaks behind"]. [Time and light—e.g., "late afternoon light catching the western faces in gold and rose, long purple shadows already filling the eastern valleys"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the air itself visible in the depth of the image, crystal clear in the foreground fading to blue haze in the distance"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on rock faces and snow, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy mountain range panorama"].

**Prompt:**


### Mountain Pass or Settlement
Human presence in the mountains, showing interaction with the landscape.

**Template:**
> [Location with specifics—e.g., "the High Gate, the only passage through the northern peaks for three hundred miles"]. [Setting—e.g., "a narrow pass cutting between towering cliffs, the path worn smooth by ten thousand years of travelers"]. [Architecture responding to environment—e.g., "a watchfort built directly into the eastern cliff face, its towers looking organic, as if the mountain had grown them"]. [Weather and altitude—e.g., "thin mountain air visible in the clarity of distant peaks, a cutting wind carrying snow horizontally across the pass"]. [Human activity—e.g., "a caravan halted at the fortress gates, weary horses steaming in the cold, guards in heavy furs checking cargo"]. [Environmental details—e.g., "ice clinging to the cliff faces where springs have frozen mid-flow, prayer flags strung across the gap snapping in the wind"]. [Scale—e.g., "the cliffs rising five hundred feet on either side, the peaks above lost in cloud"]. [Lighting—e.g., "weak winter sun providing flat light, the pass itself in shadow while the peaks above glow with morning color"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on rock faces and snow, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy mountain fortress illustration"].
