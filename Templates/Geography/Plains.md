> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating plains, create a vast open landscape that stretches to the horizon. Include the grasslands and their seasonal changes, the peoples who roam or farm them, and the sense of endless space. Plains should feel like places of freedom and exposure—nowhere to hide, but room to breathe.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this plains' character—their extent, the peoples who inhabit them, and what makes them significant.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on grasses and sky, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for these plains, include:
- **Scale and emptiness:** The vast horizontal expanse, the dominant sky, the humbling openness
- **Grass character:** Species, height, color, movement in wind, seasonal state
- **Sky presence:** Often half or more of the image, weather visible for miles
- **Light quality:** Unobstructed sun, long shadows, storm drama, sunset immensity
- **Life signs:** Grazing herds, birds of prey, dust trails, smoke columns
- **Atmosphere:** Wind effects, heat shimmer, dust, the clarity of clean air

### Plains Integration (Plains Are Skyscapes)
Every element should emphasize the overwhelming horizontal and the dominance of weather:
- *Don't write:* "grassland" → *Write:* "an ocean of grass stretching to every horizon, each blade bending together in the wind like waves rolling toward some invisible shore, the green deepening to gold where the summer sun has touched longest"
- *Don't write:* "big sky" → *Write:* "a sky that dwarfs the land beneath it, clouds building in towers miles tall, their shadows racing across the grass like the footprints of giants, the blue so deep overhead it hurts to look at"
- *Don't write:* "herd of animals" → *Write:* "a dark mass on the horizon that resolves into thousands of bison moving as one, their passage raising a dust cloud visible for ten miles, the earth trembling with their collective weight"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Plains
- **Weather drama:** storm walls visible from fifty miles, lightning walking across distant grassland, the green-yellow light before tornadoes, rain visible as grey curtains sweeping in
- **Scale elements:** a lone tree visible for miles, a rider smaller than the grass they pass through, settlements dwarfed by sky
- **Grass states:** spring green, summer gold, autumn rust, winter brown, wildflower carpets in season
- **Movement:** wind visible in the grass waves, dust devils spinning, smoke from distant fires leaning
- **Inhabitant signs:** paths worn by hooves, circles where camps were made, the distant flash of lance points or wagon metal

### Plains Vista
The endless grassland showing scale, sky, and the particular emptiness of open land.

**Template:**
> [Plains name with character—e.g., "the Sea of Grass, where the horizon is the same distance in every direction and a man can walk for a month without touching stone"]. [Grass in detail—e.g., "waist-high grass in late summer gold, each stem heavy with seed, the whole surface moving in the wind like something breathing—waves rolling from the far distance in patterns that never repeat"]. [Sky dominance—e.g., "the sky taking up two-thirds of the world, a blue vault so vast it makes the land seem incidental; clouds building in the west in towers of white and grey, their shadows already racing across the grass miles ahead of them"]. [Weather visible—e.g., "rain falling on distant grassland perhaps twenty miles north, the grey curtain moving slowly east, while here the sun still blazes and the grass stays dry"]. [Life—e.g., "a herd of wild horses visible in the middle distance, their shapes dark against the golden grass, dust rising from their movement; hawks circling on the thermals, patient dots against the blue"]. [Scale reference—e.g., "a single rider on the ancient track, horse and human together barely visible above the grass, utterly dwarfed by the landscape and sky—a reminder that here, nothing is large but the land itself"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the wind constant, carrying the smell of grass and dry earth and distant rain, the silence broken only by the rustle of stems and the cry of unseen birds"]. [Time and light—e.g., "late afternoon light turning everything to gold, long shadows stretching east from every grass clump and distant hillock, the western sky beginning to color with the first hints of sunset"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on grasses and sky, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy endless grassland landscape illustration" or "Fantasy great plains vista illustration"].

### Plains Settlement or Activity
Human presence on the plains—adaptation to life without shelter or boundary.

**Template:**
> [Settlement or activity—e.g., "a nomad encampment of the Horse People, their felt tents arranged in the traditional circle on a rare rise in the otherwise flat land"]. [Architecture adapted—e.g., "yurts of white and grey felt, each with smoke rising from the central hole, horse-lines stretching downwind, the whole camp moveable in an hour because nothing permanent survives here"]. [Human activity—e.g., "riders returning with the day's hunt, women working hides, children racing horses, the constant work of a people who move with the grass and the seasons"]. [Integration with land—e.g., "the camp barely visible until you're upon it, colors chosen to blend with the grass, no mark on the land that won't disappear in a season"]. [Plains context—e.g., "the grassland stretching away in every direction, the horizon the same whether you look north, south, east, or west, the camp a tiny island of humanity in an ocean of grass"]. [Weather relationship—e.g., "the tents oriented to the wind, windbreaks of stacked dung, the wisdom of a thousand years of living where the sky rules"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "smoke from cooking fires bent horizontal by the evening wind, the smell of horse and grass and roasting meat, the sounds of a temporary home that will be gone tomorrow or next week"]. [Lighting—e.g., "sunset light washing the camp in gold and orange, long shadows stretching east, the first stars appearing in the purple eastern sky while the west still burns"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on grasses and sky, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy nomad camp on plains illustration" or "Fantasy steppe settlement illustration"].
