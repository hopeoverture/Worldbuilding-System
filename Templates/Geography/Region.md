### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on landscapes and atmospheric effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this region, include:
- **Unified character:** The terrain, vegetation, and weather that make this region distinct
- **Human presence:** How inhabitants have shaped and been shaped by this land
- **Boundaries suggested:** The natural or political edges that define the region
- **Cultural markers:** Architecture, cultivation patterns, road networks that show regional identity
- **Environmental mood:** The particular atmosphere—welcoming, harsh, mysterious—that travelers remember
- **Scale appropriate:** Large enough to show regional character, detailed enough to feel real

### Region Integration (Regions Have Personality)
Every element should convey the region's distinct character and identity:
- *Don't write:* "hilly farmland" → *Write:* "the particular landscape of the Dales—steep-sided valleys and rounded hilltops, fields climbing impossible slopes, villages tucked into hollows, the patchwork of pasture and cultivation that generations have carved from the wild land"
- *Don't write:* "regional style" → *Write:* "whitewashed walls and steep slate roofs wherever you look, the local stone a distinctive grey-blue, every village church with its square tower—the architecture that tells you instantly where you are"
- *Don't write:* "distinct climate" → *Write:* "the mist that rises from the valleys most mornings, the particular soft rain that settles in for days, the brief brilliant summers and long grey winters that have shaped the character of the people"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Regions
- **Terrain signature:** The particular landforms that define the region, visible from every high point
- **Cultivation patterns:** How humans have worked the land—terracing, enclosure, irrigation, the shapes of fields
- **Architecture consistency:** The building materials and styles that mark everything from cottages to castles
- **Weather personality:** The characteristic light, the way seasons feel, the storms or calms that visitors remember
- **Transition zones:** Where this region becomes another, the boundaries natural and cultural

### Regional Overview
The region's character captured in a single sweeping view.

**Template:**
> [Region name with character—e.g., "the Northern Marches, frontier between civilization and the wild"]. [Defining terrain—e.g., "a landscape of contrasts—the dark wall of the Great Forest on the northern horizon, the fertile farmland of the river valley spreading south, the fortified towns on their hills watching in both directions"]. [Regional character—e.g., "the particular atmosphere of borderland, neither fully tamed nor fully wild; fields and pastures carefully maintained, but the forest always visible, always watching; the people hardy and watchful"]. [Settlements—e.g., "walled towns visible on the larger hills, their watchtowers facing north; smaller villages clustered in the safer valleys; the smoke of a hundred hearths rising in the morning air"]. [Cultivation—e.g., "the patchwork of small fields in the valleys, strip farms climbing the lower slopes, sheep-cropped pasture on the higher ground, the careful husbandry of people who know hungry seasons"]. [Natural features—e.g., "streams cutting through every valley, feeding the river that is the region's lifeline; scattered woodlots of oak and ash spared from the axe; the occasional standing stone marking older faiths"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "autumn light slanting golden across the valley, woodsmoke drifting from every chimney, the harvest in but winter on the wind—the particular melancholy beauty of the northern lands"]. [Scale—e.g., "the view stretching perhaps twenty miles, showing the regional character repeated in hills and valleys beyond, the sense of coherent identity that makes this region distinct from its neighbors"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on landscapes and atmospheric effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy borderland region landscape illustration" or "Fantasy settled frontier illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Iconic Location
A specific place that embodies regional character.

**Template:**
> [Location with regional significance—e.g., "the market town of Fordwatch, largest settlement in the Northern Marches"]. [Architecture—e.g., "the town built on a river-bend hill, walls of local grey stone surrounding red-tiled roofs, the keep on the summit flying the Duke's banner; the typical architecture of the Marches writ large"]. [Setting in region—e.g., "the river below the walls where boats bring goods from the south; the bridge that gives the town its name and its purpose; the road continuing north toward the Forest Gates"]. [Regional character—e.g., "everything practical and defensive—no building outside the walls, the watchtowers manned even in peacetime, the garrison mixing with merchants in the streets"]. [Activity—e.g., "market day filling the central square, farmers from the surrounding valleys trading with merchants from the south; smiths and leatherworkers doing steady business with the garrison; the sound of hammer and commerce"]. [Details—e.g., "the particular dress of the Marchers visible, heavier and darker than southern fashion; the weapons worn openly that would be strange elsewhere; the mix of local dialect and common tongue in the marketplace voices"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the bustle of a town that is both trading center and military outpost, the uneasy mixture of commerce and vigilance that defines the frontier"]. [Lighting—e.g., "midday sun casting sharp shadows, the town's height catching breezes that keep the summer heat bearable, flags and banners snapping in the wind"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on landscapes and atmospheric effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy frontier market town illustration" or "Fantasy regional capital illustration"].
