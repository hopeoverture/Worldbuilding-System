# {{title}}

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating steppes, create vast semi-arid grasslands—too dry for forests, too wet for desert. Include the nomadic peoples who dominate this terrain, the horse cultures, and the endless horizons. Steppes should feel like the domain of horsemen and herders, where empires rise from the saddle.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this steppe's character—its extent, the peoples who roam it, and its historical significance.
