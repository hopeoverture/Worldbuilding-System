> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a tundra, create a frozen landscape of harsh beauty—permafrost beneath, brief summers, and endless winters. Include the hardy life that survives here, the peoples adapted to the cold, and the dangers of the frozen wastes. Tundras should feel isolated and unforgiving yet hauntingly beautiful.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this tundra's character—its extent, the severity of its climate, and what makes it notable.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on snow, ice, and frozen landscapes, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this tundra, include:
- **Cold made visible:** Ice crystals in air, frost on everything, the particular quality of frozen light
- **Color palette:** The surprising colors beneath white—blues, purples, subtle greens, the brief summer bloom
- **Low-angle light:** The sun never high, long shadows, the particular gold of arctic dawn/dusk
- **Sparse life:** Low vegetation, adapted animals, the tenacity of survival in extreme cold
- **Permafrost landscape:** Polygon patterns, ice-wedge features, frost heaves, the architecture of frozen ground
- **Sky phenomena:** Aurora, sun dogs, ice halos, the particular vastness of polar sky

### Tundra Integration (Tundra Is Beautiful Death)
Every element should convey the harsh beauty and unforgiving nature of the frozen land:
- *Don't write:* "frozen landscape" → *Write:* "a world of white and pale blue stretching to a horizon that seems unnaturally far in the clear air, the snow sculpted by wind into frozen waves, the surface glittering with ice crystals that catch the low sun like scattered diamonds"
- *Don't write:* "cold climate" → *Write:* "cold beyond what southerners can imagine—cold that freezes exposed skin in minutes, that turns breath to ice crystals that fall tinkling to the snow, that demands every moment of attention or claims your life"
- *Don't write:* "sparse vegetation" → *Write:* "life reduced to its most tenacious forms—lichen crusting every south-facing rock in shades of orange and grey, moss in sheltered hollows, dwarf willows barely ankle-high representing a century of growth"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Tundra
- **Ice and snow forms:** sastrugi (wind-carved snow), frost flowers, ice fog, the blue interior of crevasses
- **Brief summer:** the explosion of wildflowers in the short warm season, meltwater lakes, the constant light
- **Adapted life:** caribou herds, arctic foxes in winter white, musk oxen hunched against wind, birds that migrate thousands of miles
- **Sky phenomena:** northern lights in curtains and pillars, the midnight sun, the months of darkness, ice halos and sun dogs
- **Human survival:** the signs of people who know how to live here, fur clothing, snow shelters, the mastery of cold

### Tundra Landscape
The frozen expanse showing the stark beauty and unforgiving nature of polar lands.

**Template:**
> [Tundra name with character—e.g., "the Breathless Waste, where the wind never stops and the cold kills the unwary in hours"]. [Terrain—e.g., "an endless plain of snow-covered permafrost rolling to the horizon, the surface shaped by wind into frozen waves and ridges, the white broken only by occasional outcrops of dark rock that have shed their snow cover to the constant gales"]. [Color—e.g., "the snow not simply white but holding every shade of pale blue and violet in its shadows, pink where the low sun catches it, the exposed ice a deeper blue that speaks of depth and age"]. [Sky—e.g., "a vast dome of pale blue deepening toward the zenith, the sun hanging low on the southern horizon even at midday, casting shadows that stretch for miles; the horizon where land meets sky indistinct in the glare of reflected light"]. [Sparse life—e.g., "lichen crusting the exposed rocks in patches of rust and sage, a distant line of caribou visible only by their movement, a white fox crossing the snow with the patient trot of a survivor"]. [Cold made visible—e.g., "ice crystals suspended in the air catching the light, breath freezing instantly into tiny diamonds that fall tinkling, the cold an almost visible presence pressing against any source of warmth"]. [Scale—e.g., "no tree, no building, nothing vertical to break the overwhelming horizontal, the land and sky merging at the edges, a human figure here barely a dot against the immensity"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the silence of cold—too cold for insects, for flowing water, for most of the sounds of life; the wind the only voice, the crunch of snow under foot unnaturally loud"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on snow, ice, and frozen landscapes, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy arctic tundra landscape illustration" or "Fantasy frozen wasteland illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Settlement or Camp
Human survival in the frozen lands—the knowledge that makes life possible.

**Template:**
> [Settlement—e.g., "a winter camp of the ice-hunters, sheltered in a hollow where the wind passes overhead"]. [Shelters—e.g., "igloos built with the skill of generations, their domed shapes perfect for shedding wind, the snow walls glowing faintly from the seal-oil lamps within; a larger snow-house for gatherings connected by low tunnels"]. [Survival infrastructure—e.g., "sled dogs curled in the snow, their breath rising in frosty clouds, their thick fur proof against cold that would kill an unprotected human; sleds upended against the wind, meat cached on high platforms away from predators"]. [Human presence—e.g., "hunters in furs emerging from the shelters, their faces barely visible within their hoods, clothing that represents generations of knowledge about surviving the cold; children playing, their shouts carrying strangely in the frozen air"]. [Warmth signs—e.g., "steam rising from the igloos' vent holes, the seal-oil lamps within visible as a faint glow through the snow walls, the contrast between the killing cold outside and the warmth humans have carved from it"]. [Tundra surrounding—e.g., "the frozen landscape stretching away in every direction, the camp a tiny island of warmth in an ocean of ice, the dark line of the distant hills the only break in the white"]. [Sky—e.g., "the aurora beginning to appear in the deepening dusk, green curtains rippling across the northern sky, the first stars emerging as the brief daylight fades"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the sounds of survival—dogs barking, children's voices, the crackle of ice underfoot—small sounds against the vast silence"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on snow, ice, and frozen landscapes, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy arctic camp illustration" or "Fantasy tundra survival settlement illustration"].
