### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on scenes of destruction and human emotion, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this tragedy, include:
- **Human cost made visible:** Faces showing shock, grief, desperation, and the particular blankness of catastrophe
- **Scale of destruction:** The scope of damage appropriate to the tragedy's magnitude—personal loss or communal devastation
- **Environmental truth:** The physical reality of the disaster—fire, water, collapse, disease, violence, made tangible and present
- **Rescue and response:** The helpers, the hopeful, and the hopeless—those trying to save what can be saved
- **Before and after:** Visual echoes of what was lost—the intact beside the destroyed, the whole beside the broken
- **Time of disaster:** Light and weather that either caused, worsened, or simply witnessed the catastrophe

### Tragedy Integration (Tragedies Are Loss Made Unforgettable)
Every element should express the tragedy's horror, its cost, and its mark on memory:
- *Don't write:* "fire in the city" → *Write:* "the night the merchant quarter burned—the flames visible from leagues away, the screaming audible over the roar of fire consuming a century of prosperity, the bucket brigades fighting what they couldn't stop, the faces of those who escaped lit by the destruction of everything they owned, the faces of those who couldn't escape lit the same way from within"
- *Don't write:* "plague victims" → *Write:* "the fever that took one in three before it was done—the cart making its rounds in a city too overwhelmed for proper burial, the bells that stopped ringing because the bell-ringers were all dead, the survivors' eyes hollow not from sickness but from watching everyone they loved die in the same weeks"
- *Don't write:* "collapsed building" → *Write:* "the moment the great hall fell during the king's feast—stone and timber and lives coming down together, the dust cloud still rising, the survivors clawing at rubble that weighs more than hope, the screaming from beneath that grows quieter with each hour, the knowledge that half the nobility of the realm is buried under what was supposed to be their celebration"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Tragedies
- **Destruction patterns:** The specific shapes of ruin—burn marks, waterlines, collapse profiles, decay progression
- **Survivor behavior:** Flight, fight, freeze, help—the range of responses to catastrophe
- **Rescue evidence:** Buckets, tools, bandages, and the improvised equipment of desperate aid
- **Loss markers:** The personal belongings, the half-destroyed homes, the abandoned positions that speak of lives interrupted
- **Environmental aftermath:** Smoke, water, dust, silence—the atmosphere of disaster
- **Light and shadow:** The illumination of catastrophe—firelight, stormlight, or the terrible clarity of morning after

### The Tragedy
The disaster in motion—catastrophe as it happens.

**Template:**
> [Tragedy unfolding—e.g., "the instant the dam broke above the valley, the moment when thirty villages discovered their doom falling toward them as a wall of water"]. [The catastrophe—e.g., "the water visible as a vertical cliff coming down the valley, taller than the tallest building in its path, carrying trees and boulders and everything it has already destroyed, the roar of it audible before it arrives—the last sound many will hear"]. [Victims—e.g., "the villages in its path, people running who cannot possibly outrun what's coming, parents carrying children toward hills that some will reach and some won't, the particular frozen postures of those who can see what's happening but cannot move"]. [Rescue attempts—e.g., "the riders who reached the lower villages in time to give warning, the bridges already packed with fleeing people, the boats launching that will save dozens while hundreds die"]. [Environmental reality—e.g., "the valley that was farmland and villages and centuries of building about to become a scoured channel, the sun still shining because nature does not care, the birds fleeing ahead of the flood that taught them what fear was"]. [Emotional weight—e.g., "the faces of those who know they will not escape, the faces of those who might, the particular horror of watching death approach at walking speed"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on scenes of destruction and human emotion, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy flood disaster illustration" or "Fantasy catastrophe scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Memorial/Aftermath
The tragedy remembered—loss preserved in stone and ceremony.

**Template:**
> [Memorial with meaning—e.g., "the monument at the head of the valley where thirty villages used to be, where the survivors' descendants still gather each year on the anniversary to remember what was lost"]. [Design—e.g., "the great stone carved with the names of every village, every family, every individual who died—names that cover every surface because there were so many, the stone worn smooth where generations of mourners have touched the names of their ancestors"]. [Setting—e.g., "the valley itself visible below, returned to farmland now but with the shapes of old villages still visible in how the land lies, the new settlements built higher on the slopes where the water didn't reach"]. [Visitors—e.g., "the descendants gathered for the commemoration, families tracing names on the stone, children learning the story their great-grandparents survived, the old priest speaking the words spoken every year since the flood"]. [Offerings—e.g., "flowers at the monument's base, the traditional offerings of bread and water that represent what the valley lost, the small boats placed there by those who still dream of the drowned"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular grief of an anniversary, the living connection to loss three generations old, the morning light on the monument that has become a place of pilgrimage"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on scenes of destruction and human emotion, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy tragedy memorial illustration" or "Fantasy disaster commemoration scene"].
