### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on diplomatic scenes and period elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this treaty, include:
- **Power dynamics visible:** The winner and loser, the dominant and submissive, shown in posture, position, and expression
- **Diplomatic ceremony:** The formal rituals that transform agreement into binding commitment—the performance of peace
- **Document as actor:** The treaty itself as significant object—prepared, sealed, signed, and preserved
- **Witnesses as legitimacy:** The observers whose presence makes the agreement binding and remembered
- **Cultural collision:** Different traditions, dress codes, and diplomatic styles meeting at the negotiating table
- **Aftermath shadows:** The terms visible in faces—the concessions that pain, the victories that satisfy

### Treaty Integration (Treaties Are Peace Made Permanent)
Every element should express the agreement's significance, its cost, and its hope:
- *Don't write:* "peace treaty signing" → *Write:* "the moment the Succession War ended with a quill stroke—the king's hand finishing his signature on terms that cost him a third of his grandfather's kingdom but kept him his throne, the pretender watching with the expression of a man who won the war but lost the peace"
- *Don't write:* "diplomatic negotiation" → *Write:* "the tenth hour of negotiations that will either end a century of border wars or restart them—the maps covered with rejected proposals, the ambassadors' clothing rumpled from days without rest, the wine untouched because no one trusts enough to drink"
- *Don't write:* "alliance ceremony" → *Write:* "the marriage of convenience between former enemies—the new queen visible in the gown of her natal country while accepting the crown of another, the court behind her frozen between welcome and old hatred"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Treaties
- **Seating politics:** Who sits where, who stands, who holds the quill—hierarchy made visible
- **Document materials:** The vellum, ink, seals, and ribbons that distinguish a treaty from common paper
- **Cultural dress:** The formal attire of different traditions meeting in compromise
- **Emotional truth:** Faces showing the real feelings beneath diplomatic masks—relief, resentment, calculation
- **Temporal markers:** The time of day, season of year, and era visible in setting and costume
- **Witness hierarchy:** The officials, nobles, priests, and functionaries whose presence legitimizes the agreement

### Signing Ceremony
The treaty made—war ending, peace beginning.

**Template:**
> [Ceremony with weight—e.g., "the moment the great seal touched the treaty that ended thirty years of border war, when two kingdoms finally admitted what their soldiers had known for years"]. [The signatories—e.g., "the old king of the eastern realm, his hand steady despite age because he has waited half his life for this moment, the young queen of the west who inherited her mother's war and chose her own peace"]. [The document—e.g., "the treaty spread between them, the terms visible in beautiful script, the space for signatures still empty, the seals waiting in their boxes"]. [The witnesses—e.g., "both courts in formal attendance, the generals who fought each other now standing behind their sovereigns, the ambassadors watching their work become history"]. [The setting—e.g., "the neutral temple chosen for sacred ground status, the banners of both realms hanging together for the first time"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular tension of hope and mistrust mixed, the silence before the scratching of quills"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on diplomatic scenes and period elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy peace treaty illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Treaty Document
The agreement preserved—words binding nations.

**Template:**
> [Treaty as artifact—e.g., "the original document of the Peace of Thornfield, the paper that holds the promise of every sovereign who has signed it since the war ended"]. [Document details—e.g., "calfskin vellum that will last longer than any kingdom, text in formal diplomatic script, illuminated initial letters showing the arms of signatories"]. [Seals and signatures—e.g., "the great seals of both kingdoms in wax of heraldic colors, ribbons faded but intact, the signatures of the original king and queen and their successors who renewed the treaty"]. [Age and preservation—e.g., "the vellum darkened with centuries but ink still legible, careful repairs where the document was damaged and restored"]. [Display context—e.g., "mounted in the treaty room of the royal archive, light controlled to prevent fading, other documents visible nearby"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular reverence of a document that changed history, the silence of the archive, time collapsed in the fresh signatures and dust of hands"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on diplomatic scenes and period elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy historical treaty document illustration"].
