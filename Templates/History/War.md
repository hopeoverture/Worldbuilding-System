### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on military elements and battlefield scenes, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this war, include:
- **Scale of suffering:** Wars consume nations—show the weight of armies, the extent of destruction, the faces of those who bear the cost
- **Factional identity:** Banners, uniforms, and equipment that distinguish sides and announce allegiances
- **Strategic landscape:** Terrain that explains tactics—the hill that was worth dying for, the river that divided forces, the city that anchored lines
- **Human cost visible:** Not just the glory but the exhaustion, fear, wounds, and loss that make war real
- **Leadership burden:** Commanders carrying the weight of lives in their decisions
- **Time of war:** The season, weather, and hour that shape combat—winter campaigns, night attacks, morning charges

### War Integration (Wars Are History Written in Blood)
Every element should express the conflict's nature, its cost, and its reshaping of the world:
- *Don't write:* "medieval battle" → *Write:* "the clash that would decide which dynasty ruled for the next three centuries—two armies meeting on the plain that had already drunk blood in wars their grandfathers fought, the banners of falcon and serpent visible above formations that have been marching toward this moment for months, the dust of their collision visible for miles"
- *Don't write:* "siege warfare" → *Write:* "the siege that has starved a city for seven months—the walls still holding but the defenders visible on them thin as scarecrows, the besieging army's camps grown into a temporary city of their own, the siege engines prepared for the assault everyone knows is coming"
- *Don't write:* "war council" → *Write:* "the council where three kings must decide whether to continue a war their fathers started—the maps showing territory gained and lost across two generations, the generals aging under the weight of campaigns they've fought since boyhood, the young heirs listening and learning"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Wars
- **Factional markings:** Heraldry, colors, and symbols that identify sides at a glance
- **Exhaustion evidence:** The wear on soldiers, equipment, and landscape that accumulates through campaigns
- **Command perspective:** The vantage from which leaders make decisions—hilltops, command tents, castle walls
- **Supply realities:** The wagons, camps, and logistics that make armies possible
- **Civilian presence:** Refugees, camp followers, and non-combatants caught in the conflict
- **Weather as participant:** Rain, snow, heat, and mud that shape battles and campaigns

### Battle Scene
War in action—nations colliding, futures being determined.

**Template:**
> [Battle with stakes—e.g., "the field of Ashford where the succession was finally decided, where two claimants' armies met after years of maneuvering"]. [The clash—e.g., "the moment the lines meet, the cavalry charge opening on the flank, the infantry pushing in the center where the royal standards mark command positions, the whole field alive with history being made"]. [Factional identity—e.g., "the silver gryphon on blue of the eastern claimant visible on every shield, the black tower on gold of the western pretender answering across the bloody ground between, each soldier fighting for a crown they will never wear"]. [Terrain as factor—e.g., "the ridge that gives the eastern host the high ground, the stream that slows the western cavalry, the village burning where neither side can claim it"]. [Human reality—e.g., "faces visible in the chaos—a knight whose helm has been lost, a bannerman holding his lord's colors while bleeding, the dead accumulating where the fighting has been fiercest"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "afternoon light struggling through the dust and smoke, the particular chaos of a battle where everything is being decided"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on military elements and battlefield scenes, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy succession war battle illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### War Council/Treaty
War directed—the decisions that move armies.

**Template:**
> [Council with weight—e.g., "the command council on the eve of the battle that will end the war one way or another, generals who have fought together for years facing the map"]. [Setting—e.g., "the command tent that has been home for the campaign season, the map table showing terrain and forces, the candles burning late because no one will sleep tonight"]. [Participants—e.g., "the king who started this war for vengeance and has learned to want only its ending, the general whose strategies have kept them alive, the cavalry commander whose decision tomorrow will turn the battle"]. [Documents and tools—e.g., "maps annotated with troop positions, letters from enemy commanders offering terms refused, casualty lists that grow longer each day"]. [Tension visible—e.g., "the disagreement between aggressive and cautious plans visible in stances, the weight of decision pressing on shoulders that have carried it for months"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "candlelight and shadow, the smell of canvas and armor oil, the night before battle when everything can still go either way"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on military elements and battlefield scenes, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy war council illustration"].
