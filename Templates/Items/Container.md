### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on materials and craftsmanship, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this container, include:
- **Purpose in design:** The form shaped by function—how it opens, carries, protects what it holds
- **Material honesty:** The leather, wood, metal, or fabric visible and authentic in texture and wear
- **Security evidence:** The locks, clasps, seals, or wards that protect the contents
- **Travel marks:** The scuffs, stains, and wear patterns that tell of journeys taken
- **Craft tradition:** The style and techniques that identify maker and origin
- **Promise of contents:** The suggestion of what might be within, the reason for the container's existence

### Container Integration (Containers Are Protection Made Portable)
Every element should express the container's purpose and the value of what it guards:
- *Don't write:* "leather satchel" → *Write:* "a courier's bag that's crossed the kingdom a hundred times, the leather dark with road dust and rain that's been oiled away, the brass fittings green with age but the lock still true, the shoulder strap worn thin where it's rubbed against a hundred different cloaks—the kind of bag that's trusted with messages worth killing for"
- *Don't write:* "treasure chest" → *Write:* "an ironbound chest that's older than the dynasty it was made to serve, the oak so old it's turned the color of iron, the bands showing the hammer marks of the smith who forged them, the lock a puzzle that's claimed three lockpicks' fingers, the whole thing heavy enough to need two strong people to lift—and whatever's inside is worth that weight in gold"
- *Don't write:* "magical bag" → *Write:* "a bag that weighs the same empty or full, the leather soft as shadow and twice as dark, the interior deeper than the exterior suggests—far deeper, impossibly deeper, a throat into somewhere else that accepts whatever's fed to it and returns it on command, the clasp warm to touch as if the bag itself is alive"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Containers
- **Wear archaeology:** The scuffs, stains, and repairs that map the container's history
- **Security theater:** The locks, seals, and wards that advertise protection
- **Carrying adaptations:** Handles, straps, and grips shaped by use
- **Interior organization:** Compartments, padding, and structure designed for specific contents
- **Material aging:** How leather darkens, wood weathers, metal patinas with time
- **Magic markers:** For enchanted containers, the impossible properties made visual—wrong shadows, strange weight, extradimensional hints

### Closed View
The container sealed—protection evident, contents mysterious.

**Template:**
> [Container with purpose—e.g., "the war chest of the Valdren mercenary company, carried through seventeen campaigns and trusted with the payroll that keeps soldiers loyal"]. [Construction—e.g., "ironbound oak with corners reinforced for rough handling, the bands bearing the dents of sword-strikes from the battle where it almost fell into enemy hands, the wood dark with the smoke of a hundred campfires, the brass lock plate showing the company's wolf-head emblem"]. [Security—e.g., "triple-locked with mechanisms of increasing complexity, the outermost for speed, the second for serious protection, the third a puzzle lock that requires knowledge rather than keys—the whole system designed by a paranoid paymaster who died rich"]. [Travel evidence—e.g., "the carrying handles wrapped in leather worn smooth by hands, the bottom showing the scratches of a hundred different floors, the rope loops for pack-horse transport still attached though fraying"]. [Condition—e.g., "battered but intact, every dent a story of survival, maintained with the care soldiers give things they depend on—oiled leather, polished brass, the lock mechanism regularly tested"]. [Setting—e.g., "resting in the company's current quarters, the captain's seal on the outer lock fresh, the guards visible at the door's edge, the particular security of temporary safety"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on materials and craftsmanship, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy war chest illustration" or "Fantasy military strongbox portrait"].

**Prompt:**


### Open/Interior View
The container revealed—contents glimpsed, purpose fulfilled.

**Template:**
> [Container opened—e.g., "the alchemist's traveling case, opened on her workbench to reveal the organization of a lifetime's practice"]. [Interior design—e.g., "compartments fitted for specific vials and tools, each space shaped for exactly one thing, the velvet lining stained with old spills in colors that suggest dangerous work, the lid's interior bearing a mirror for precise applications and notes in a personal shorthand"]. [Contents visible—e.g., "vials of graduated sizes in their racks, each labeled in the same careful hand, reagent pouches in the lid pocket, the mortar and pestle nested together, the silver knife in its sheath—everything a traveling alchemist needs, nothing more"]. [Craftsmanship—e.g., "the case itself made by someone who understood the work, the hinges positioned so they don't block access, the lock recessed so it can't spill into the contents, the handle balanced for comfortable carrying even when full"]. [Use evidence—e.g., "some vials empty or nearly so, the mortar bearing traces of recent grinding, the notes showing additions in fresher ink, the case of someone in the middle of their work rather than displaying a collection"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "workbench light catching the glass vials, the particular intimacy of someone's essential tools laid open, the trust implicit in showing this to an observer"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on materials and craftsmanship, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy alchemist's case illustration" or "Fantasy professional toolkit interior"].
