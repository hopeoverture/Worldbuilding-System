> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a cursed item, create an object whose benefits come with a hidden or delayed cost. The curse should feel thematically connected to the item's power or history—not arbitrary malice. Consider why the curse exists: divine punishment, failed enchantment, bound entity, or deliberate trap. The best cursed items tempt users with genuine power while creating interesting complications.
>
> **Curse Severity Levels:**

## Image Prompts

### Art Style
**Dark fantasy digital art, ominous atmosphere, subtle wrongness, beautiful yet unsettling, rich textures with hints of corruption, dramatic lighting with deep shadows, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### The Temptation
The item as it first appears—beautiful, powerful, desirable, with only subtle hints of danger.

**Template:**
> [Desirable presentation—e.g., "an elegant silver ring displayed on black velvet, the band wrought with delicate filigree, a perfect sapphire catching light like captured starlight"]. [Quality and craftsmanship—e.g., "elven silverwork of the highest order, the kind of piece that adorns queens, the metal untarnished despite obvious age"]. [Subtle wrongness—e.g., "yet the reflection in the gemstone shows a room that doesn't quite match the one it sits in, the shadows inside the sapphire moving when shadows outside are still"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the velvet around it seeming to absorb light, the air above it carrying a faint chill"]. Dark fantasy digital art, beautiful yet unsettling, dramatic lighting, rich textures, 8K quality. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy cursed ring illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### The Truth
The item as it truly is, or as it appears to those suffering its curse—the beauty stripped away or twisted.

**Template:**
> [Revealed nature—e.g., "the same ring now worn on a withered hand, the silver band seeming to have grown into the flesh, the skin around it grey and mottled"]. [Corruption visible—e.g., "the sapphire no longer reflects light but drinks it, the depths of the gem showing something that might be an eye, might be a void"]. [Victim's state—e.g., "the hand that wears it trembling, fingers unable to straighten, veins visible and darkened beneath papery skin"]. [Atmosphere of dread—e.g., "shadows clustering around the ring as if drawn to it, the air rippling with cold"]. Dark fantasy horror art, unsettling, dramatic lighting, visceral detail, 8K quality. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy cursed ring horror illustration"].
