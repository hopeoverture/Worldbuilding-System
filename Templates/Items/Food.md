### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this food, include:
- **Culinary identity:** The dish's cultural origins visible in ingredients, presentation, and serving vessel
- **Sensory invitation:** Textures, colors, and steam that communicate taste and aroma through vision alone
- **Preparation evidence:** The craft visible in the cooking—proper searing, careful arrangement, intentional garnish
- **Context authenticity:** The setting matching the food's class—peasant fare on rough boards, noble dishes on silver
- **Ingredient story:** The components visible and identifiable, each bringing its flavor and origin to the whole
- **Moment captured:** The perfect temperature, the ideal presentation, the instant before enjoyment

### Food Integration (Food Is Culture Made Edible)
Every element should express the dish's origins, preparation, and the pleasure it offers:
- *Don't write:* "roasted meat on plate" → *Write:* "a haunch of venison that's been turning on the spit since morning, the fat rendered down to a crackling crust of rosemary and salt, the meat sliced to show the gradient from well-done edge to pink center, resting on a wooden trencher dark with the juices of a hundred previous meals—steam still rising, carrying the smell of the forest it came from"
- *Don't write:* "bowl of stew" → *Write:* "a traveler's stew in the style of the eastern reaches, the broth the deep amber of proper stock reduction, chunks of root vegetables soft enough to cut with a spoon, scraps of meat from whatever the hunter brought that morning, a heel of dark bread balanced on the rim—the bowl itself rough ceramic, chipped and honest, the kind that's warmed a thousand cold travelers"
- *Don't write:* "fancy dessert" → *Write:* "a nobleman's folly—a tower of spun sugar and cream, the pastry layers thin enough to shatter at a touch, exotic fruits arranged in deliberate asymmetry, the whole thing dusted with gold that's edible but serves no purpose except to demonstrate wealth, presented on porcelain so fine the light passes through it"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Food
- **Cooking evidence:** The crust, the caramelization, the char marks, the glaze that speaks of technique
- **Temperature indicators:** Steam rising, frost forming, the visible heat or cold of the dish
- **Cultural signifiers:** Serving vessels, garnish styles, presentation traditions that identify origin
- **Ingredient visibility:** Components distinct and identifiable, their quality evident
- **Consumption context:** The table setting, the other dishes, the hands reaching or utensils waiting
- **Moment of perfection:** The brief window when everything is exactly right

### Plated Dish
The food revealed—culinary craft awaiting appreciation.

**Template:**
> [Dish with identity—e.g., "the roasted boar that's been the centerpiece of Valdren feasts for three centuries, prepared in the style that the founding lord's cook invented and every heir has demanded since"]. [Cooking evidence—e.g., "the skin crackling and amber where proper slow roasting rendered the fat, the meat beneath still pink and glistening with juice, carved tableside so each slice shows the graduation from crisp exterior to tender heart"]. [Presentation—e.g., "presented on the silver platter that's older than the current dynasty, surrounded by the roasted apples and preserved cherries that tradition demands, the herbs scattered not randomly but in the pattern that's become heraldic"]. [Accompaniments—e.g., "the sauce boat beside it steaming with the reduction that takes three days to make properly, the bread basket with the seven-grain loaf that's been baked to match, the goblets of the red wine that complements the meat's richness"]. [Temperature and freshness—e.g., "steam still rising from the first cut, the aroma visible in how nearby candles flicker with the heat currents, the moment captured between kitchen and consumption"]. [Setting—e.g., "the high table of the great hall visible behind, the silver and crystal of a formal feast, the expectant silence before the first slice is served"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on food textures and presentation, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy feast centerpiece illustration" or "Fantasy noble cuisine portrait"].

[Setting—e.g., "the village square at dawn, the baker's oven built into the communal wall, the women gathering with their baskets, the smell of fresh bread competing with salt air and fish, the particular energy of a community that starts its day together"]. [The food itself—e.g., "round loaves dark with rye and speckled with seed, the crusts cracked in the pattern that means proper rising, sized to feed a family for a day, steam escaping through the baker's cloth as she transfers them to waiting baskets"]. [Cultural elements—e.g., "the traditional exchange—a coin and a blessing, the loaves marked with each family's sign so there's no confusion, the children waiting for the broken ones that are their right as witnesses"]. [Activity—e.g., "the baker's hands flour-dusted and capable, working without thought after thirty years of practice, the rhythm of community visible in how everyone knows their place and time"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "morning light catching the steam and flour dust, the particular warmth of a place where food and community interweave, the smell that means home to everyone who grew up within it"].
