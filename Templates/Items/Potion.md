### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on glass, liquid, and magical effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this potion, include:
- **Liquid behavior:** How the potion moves, settles, and reacts—natural liquids don't glow from within or defy gravity
- **Container craft:** The glass or crystal that contains it, from crude adventurer's vials to master alchemist's vessels
- **Ingredient echoes:** Hints of what went into the brewing—a floating leaf, suspended crystals, swirling color layers
- **Effect suggestion:** Visual cues that hint at what the potion does—healing potions warm and vital, poisons cold and sharp
- **Alchemical tradition:** The school or culture evident in presentation—dwarven potions in metal flasks, elvish in living crystal
- **Consumption evidence:** Whether sealed and pristine or partially drunk, the state that tells its story

### Potion Integration (Potions Are Transformation Made Drinkable)
Every element should express the potion's power and the craft that created it:
- *Don't write:* "red healing potion" → *Write:* "a healing potion glowing with the warm crimson of oxygenated blood, tiny motes of golden light rising through the liquid like bubbles in champagne, the whole flask radiating the gentle warmth of a mother's touch—the cork sealed with wax stamped by the Temple's blessing, the glass etched with prayers too small to read"
- *Don't write:* "poison vial" → *Write:* "a vial of something that refuses to be a proper color, shifting between green and purple as the angle changes, the liquid too thick and too thin at once, leaving trails on the glass that shouldn't exist—no label, no seal, just a cork that seems fused to the neck as if the vial knows what it contains and fears release"
- *Don't write:* "potion of invisibility" → *Write:* "a flask that appears empty until moved, the liquid catching light only in motion, the refraction revealing something that's there but not there—the glass itself seeming uncertain of whether it contains anything, the weight wrong for an empty vessel, the stopper warm to touch despite the contents having no temperature at all"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Potions
- **Luminescence source:** Where the glow comes from—suspended particles, the liquid itself, a reaction with light
- **Movement patterns:** How the potion behaves—layers that never mix, spirals that never settle, particles that rise against gravity
- **Temperature evidence:** Frost on the glass, steam escaping the cork, the visible cold or heat of magical transformation
- **Ingredient archaeology:** The visible remnants of what went into the brewing, suspended in eternal dissolution
- **Container personality:** The vessel that holds it—mass-produced adventurer's vials versus master-crafted presentation flasks
- **Consumption marks:** The residue on glass where the liquid has been drunk, the evidence of doses taken

### Potion Portrait
The potion revealed—liquid magic awaiting consumption.

**Template:**
> [Potion with character—e.g., "a potion of giant's strength in its standard adventurer's flask, the kind sold by the dozen but containing power that could level a wall"]. [Liquid behavior—e.g., "the liquid the deep amber of autumn ale but shot through with veins of gold that pulse slowly like a sleeping heartbeat, the whole solution too thick to be natural, clinging to the glass in ways that suggest reluctance to be poured"]. [Container craft—e.g., "a standard alchemist's flask of the Northern Kingdoms style, the glass thick and practical, the cork waxed with the red seal of the Brewmaster's Guild—competent craft rather than art, a tool meant to be used rather than admired"]. [Magical manifestation—e.g., "light passing through the liquid emerging slightly bent, as if strength itself had weight that curved the rays, the flask casting a shadow larger than it should, denser than the light would suggest"]. [Ingredient traces—e.g., "suspended in the amber, visible at certain angles, a fragment of something that might be claw or horn, slowly dissolving over years, the source of the strength it will convey"]. [Setting—e.g., "resting on a merchant's counter, one of seven in a padded case, the casual presentation belying the battlefield value of what each flask contains"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "candlelight setting the amber glowing, the shadows on the wall showing the flask's shape but somehow larger, as if the potion's potential cast its own shadow"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on glass, liquid, and magical effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy strength potion illustration" or "Fantasy magical elixir portrait"].

**Prompt:**


### Brewing/Context
The potion in its creation or use—alchemy in action.

**Template:**
> [Context with purpose—e.g., "the moment of completion in Master Theron's laboratory, when a month of careful work condenses into a single flask of perfect brewing"]. [The potion—e.g., "the just-finished elixir still warm from the final distillation, the color settling from chaotic swirl to the proper amber as the magical reaction stabilizes, the last golden motes finding their orbits within the liquid"]. [Alchemist's space—e.g., "the laboratory around it a controlled chaos of thirty years' practice—alembics and retorts in active use, ingredient jars labeled in personal shorthand no one else can read, reference books open to pages marked by decades of annotations"]. [Process evidence—e.g., "the distillation apparatus still dripping the last drops, the measuring instruments laid out in the order of use, the ingredient containers open with their contributions visible—the giant's toe, the hill-beast's bile, the cave moss that grows only in perfect darkness"]. [Craft atmosphere—e.g., "the air thick with aromatics that would be nauseating individually but combine to something almost pleasant, the heat from multiple flame sources, the condensation on cold glassware, the particular intensity of creation at its crucial moment"]. [The alchemist—e.g., "Master Theron's hands visible at the frame's edge, stained with the colors of a thousand brews, steady despite age, holding the final flask up to candlelight to check the color against memory and experience"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the moment of success, the culmination of expertise, the particular satisfaction of craft perfected—the potion ready to change someone's fate, the alchemist ready to begin again"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on glass, liquid, and magical effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy alchemy laboratory illustration" or "Fantasy potion brewing scene"].
