> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a vehicle, create a conveyance with distinct character, practical statistics, and interesting history. Consider how it moves, what makes it special, who operates it, and what stories it has been part of. Vehicles should feel like more than transportation—they're settings for adventure, symbols of status, and characters in their own right.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this vehicle's identity—what type it is, what makes it notable, who operates it, and its reputation.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on construction and maritime/vehicle elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this vehicle, include:
- **Engineering character:** The construction revealing its maker—dwarven precision, elvish elegance, human practicality
- **Journey evidence:** The wear patterns, repairs, and modifications that map voyages taken
- **Crew presence:** The hands that operate it, the stations designed for specific tasks, the human scale within the machine
- **Element relationship:** How the vehicle interacts with its medium—cutting through water, riding wind, rolling over terrain
- **Identity marks:** The name, figurehead, colors, or symbols that distinguish this vessel from others
- **Purpose expression:** Cargo vessels built for capacity, warships for combat, pleasure craft for comfort

### Vehicle Integration (Vehicles Are Journey Made Possible)
Every element should express the vehicle's purpose, history, and the adventures it enables:
- *Don't write:* "sailing ship at dock" → *Write:* "a three-masted trader resting in harbor, her hull showing the salt-stains of a hundred crossings, the wood patched where storms tested her, the figurehead—a woman with arms outstretched—worn smooth by spray and touched by sailors for luck, her name painted fresh on the stern because captains believe a clear name keeps a ship found"
- *Don't write:* "carriage on road" → *Write:* "a noble's traveling coach that's seen both coronation parades and midnight escapes, the lacquer still bright where servants polish it, the springs squeaking with the particular complaint of well-used quality, the interior visible through windows that have shown passengers both triumph and exile—the family crest on the door speaking of lineage older than the current king"
- *Don't write:* "airship in flight" → *Write:* "a cloudclipper riding the thermals above the mountains, her envelope patched with a dozen different fabrics from emergency repairs across the trading routes, the gondola hanging beneath like a spider on silk, the propellers turning with the particular rhythm of dwarf-made mechanisms, the whole impossible contraption held aloft by magic and engineering in equal measure"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Vehicles
- **Voyage archaeology:** Repairs from specific incidents, salt-staining patterns, the wear map of use
- **Crew domestication:** Personal touches, mascots, the modifications that make a vehicle home
- **Engineering identity:** The building tradition visible in design—how different cultures solve the same problems differently
- **Movement evidence:** Wake, wheel ruts, or atmospheric disturbance that shows how the vehicle travels
- **Cargo traces:** Stains, dents, and wear from what's been carried
- **Identity proclamation:** Names, colors, figureheads, and flags that announce ownership and purpose

### Vehicle Portrait
The vehicle at rest—engineering made visible, journeys implicit.

**Template:**
> [Vehicle with identity—e.g., "the Valdren's Pride, flagship of the merchant fleet that's made the family fortune across six generations, named for the founder who first saw that trade needed fast ships rather than large ones"]. [Construction—e.g., "a caravel built for speed over cargo, the hull narrow and deep, the masts raked back in the style that's become the Valdren signature, every line optimized for the wind—she can outrun anything that can outfight her"]. [Distinctive features—e.g., "the figurehead carved as the first Valdren, arm pointing toward the horizon, the wood replaced three times but always to the same design; the hull painted the distinctive sea-green that marks all Valdren ships; the brass fittings polished bright enough to signal in sunlight"]. [Journey evidence—e.g., "the hull patched at the waterline where she scraped a reef two winters past, the rigging replaced entirely after the storm that claimed the previous flagship, the rail worn smooth where three generations of sailors have leaned watching for land"]. [Current condition—e.g., "riding at anchor in the family's home port, sails furled but ready, crew visible making her ready for the season's first voyage, the particular energy of a ship about to wake from winter rest"]. [Setting—e.g., "the harbor visible around her, other Valdren ships at nearby moorings, the family's countinghouse on the dock where the fortune she's helped build is managed"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on construction and maritime/vehicle elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy merchant ship illustration" or "Fantasy sailing vessel portrait"].

**Prompt:**


### In Motion
The vehicle in its element—purpose fulfilled, journey in progress.

**Template:**
> [Vehicle in action—e.g., "the Valdren's Pride running before a following wind, driving toward a landfall that means profit and safety after a month at sea"]. [Movement evidence—e.g., "every sail full and drawing, the ship heeling slightly to starboard as she rides the swells, her wake stretching behind her in the white-foam line that marks a vessel making way, the bow spray catching rainbows in the afternoon light"]. [Crew at work—e.g., "sailors visible in the rigging making final adjustments to catch every breath of wind, the captain at the helm reading the weather, the lookout in the crow's nest watching for the harbor markers, everyone in their place in the choreography of arrival"]. [Environment interaction—e.g., "the sea around her the deep blue of open water giving way to the green of shallowing approach, gulls appearing from ahead as the first sign of land, the smell of shore reaching the sailors before they can see it"]. [Condition in motion—e.g., "the rigging singing in the wind, the timbers creaking with the particular music of a ship working, the hull rising and falling with the swells in the rhythm that becomes second nature to sailors"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "late afternoon light painting the sails gold, the satisfaction of voyage nearly complete, the particular beauty of a vessel doing what she was built to do"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy ship under sail illustration" or "Fantasy naval vessel in motion scene"].
