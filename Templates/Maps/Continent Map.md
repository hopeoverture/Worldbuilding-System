> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a continent map, create a detailed top-down view of a single landmass showing its regions, nations, terrain, and major settlements. The map should provide enough detail for campaign planning while maintaining readability. Include political boundaries, trade routes, and geographic features with consistent iconography throughout.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences describing this continent map's purpose, the landmass it depicts, and its intended use (regional reference, political overview, travel planning, etc.).
