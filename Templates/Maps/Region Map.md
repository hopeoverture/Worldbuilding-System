> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a region map, create a detailed top-down view of a specific area showing all settlements, terrain features, roads, and points of interest at a scale useful for adventure planning. The map should show enough detail to plan overland travel, identify encounter locations, and understand the relationships between settlements. Include travel distances, terrain obstacles, and adventure hooks visible in the geography.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences describing this region map's purpose, the area it depicts, and its intended use (travel reference, adventure planning, local campaign setting, etc.).
