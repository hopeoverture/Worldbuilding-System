### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on commercial settings and goods, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this business, include:
- **Commercial purpose:** The space designed for commerce, the flow from entrance to browse to transaction
- **Quality expression:** The condition and presentation of goods communicating price point and target customer
- **Proprietor presence:** The owner as heart of the business, their expertise and approach visible in how they engage
- **Transaction infrastructure:** Counters, scales, strongboxes—the mechanisms of buying and selling
- **Customer relationship:** The dynamic between seller and buyer, the negotiation or the smooth sale
- **Business identity:** What distinguishes this enterprise from competitors, the specialization that creates value

### Business Integration (Commerce Is Value Made Visible)
Every element should express the business's trade, reputation, and the value it creates:
- *Don't write:* "shop with merchandise" → *Write:* "a trading house where wealth from three continents passes through every week, the showroom displaying samples of goods that fill warehouses along the docks—silks from the east in every color, spices from the south in sealed jars, northern furs stacked to show quality grades, everything arranged to tempt the eye of merchants who buy wholesale"
- *Don't write:* "merchant at counter" → *Write:* "the factor behind his desk of exotic hardwood, ledgers open before him showing accounts in a dozen currencies, his dress modest enough to seem trustworthy yet fine enough to demonstrate success, his eyes assessing every customer with the calculation of forty years in the trade"
- *Don't write:* "customers shopping" → *Write:* "a noble's steward examining silk samples with the knowing touch of someone who will answer for a bad purchase, a merchant comparing prices with figures from a competitor, a factor from a distant city negotiating terms that will bind both parties across a thousand miles of sea"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Businesses
- **Trade markers:** The goods that define the business, displayed to best advantage, quality evident
- **Transaction spaces:** Counters for negotiation, private rooms for significant deals, the choreography of commerce
- **Proprietor authority:** The position from which the owner commands the space, their expertise visible in arrangement and approach
- **Financial infrastructure:** The strongbox, the scales, the ledgers—the mechanisms of money
- **Quality stratification:** Different goods for different customers, the hierarchy of price and prestige
- **Reputation evidence:** Testimonials, famous clients, the signs of a business with a name worth protecting

### Storefront/Interior
The business in its commercial space—where value changes hands.

**Template:**
> [Business with identity—e.g., "the counting house of the Valdoran Trading Company, where fortunes are made and broken over cups of coffee and handshakes"]. [Commercial space—e.g., "a room designed for serious negotiation, the walls paneled in exotic woods from the company's trade routes, maps showing shipping lanes and caravan routes, the company seal in brass above the door that reminds everyone what reputation backs every deal"]. [Trade evidence—e.g., "samples of the company's goods in glass cases along the walls—the finest spices in crystal jars, fabric swatches showing the quality that bears the Valdoran stamp, a single bar of silver from the company's mining interests displayed as both sample and intimidation"]. [The proprietor—e.g., "the senior factor at his desk, a man who has built wealth for others for forty years, his modest clothing belied by the quality of his chair, his sharp eyes assessing visitors before they've finished entering, a ledger open before him that could tell the story of a kingdom's economy"]. [Transaction in progress—e.g., "a merchant from the coast presenting letters of introduction, his factor counting samples, the delicate dance of first-time dealing where reputation and terms must be established"]. [Commercial atmosphere—e.g., "the smell of coffee from the pot that's always ready for negotiations, the rustle of parchment contracts, the clink of sample coins being tested, the particular intensity of a room where decisions create wealth or ruin"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on commercial settings and goods, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy trading house interior illustration" or "Fantasy merchant company scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Business Transaction
The moment of commerce—where buyer and seller negotiate value.

**Template:**
> [Transaction with stakes—e.g., "the negotiation that will determine whether the southern spice shipment goes to the Valdoran Company or their rivals"]. [Participants—e.g., "the company factor facing the ship captain across a table strewn with samples and documents, the factor's experience evident in his patient posture, the captain's desperation visible in his forward lean and the sweat at his temples"]. [Goods at stake—e.g., "between them the samples that represent the hold of a ship three weeks from harbor—saffron that could be worth its weight in gold if the quality is true, pepper in sealed jars, cinnamon sticks arranged for inspection, the smell of fortune filling the room"]. [Negotiation elements—e.g., "the factor's hand resting on a purse of silver, not yet offered; the captain's papers showing the ship's manifest; the scales that will settle any dispute about weight; the contract waiting for signatures that will bind both parties"]. [Power dynamics—e.g., "the factor having the power of cash and patience, the captain having the power of cargo and alternatives, both knowing the other's position well enough that the negotiation is ritual more than combat"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular tension of a deal reaching conclusion, the world narrowed to this room and these numbers, the awareness that the stroke of a pen will determine months of profit or loss"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on commercial settings and goods, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy merchant negotiation illustration" or "Fantasy business transaction scene"].
