> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a criminal organization, create an underworld group that operates outside the law for profit, power, or ideology. Include their criminal enterprises, organizational structure, territory, and relationship with both law enforcement and legitimate society. Criminal organizations should feel dangerous but also understandable—people don't join for no reason.

## Overview
