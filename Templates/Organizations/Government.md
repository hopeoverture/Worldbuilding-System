### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on architecture, heraldry, and ceremonial elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this government, include:
- **Authority architecture:** Spaces designed to awe and humble, to make visitors feel the weight of power, to elevate those who wield it
- **Legitimacy symbols:** The heraldry, seals, and standards that claim the right to rule, the visual language of sovereignty
- **Power mechanics:** The throne, the council table, the positions where decisions are made and orders given
- **Institutional continuity:** The portraits of predecessors, the ancient laws, the weight of tradition made visible
- **Ceremony and procedure:** The rituals that make power legitimate, the formal spaces where law is enacted
- **Guard and enforcement:** The visible reminder that power is backed by steel, the military aspect of governance

### Government Integration (Power Is Performance)
Every element should express the authority's legitimacy, history, and mechanisms of control:
- *Don't write:* "throne room" → *Write:* "the great hall where the dynasty has received subjects for six hundred years, the throne raised on a dais seven steps above the floor so every petitioner must look up, the walls hung with the victories of dead kings and the heraldry of vassal houses, the geometry of power made stone and gold"
- *Don't write:* "guards at the door" → *Write:* "the royal guard in ceremonial armor that is also perfectly functional, standing at positions unchanged since the hall was built, their presence reminding every visitor that the beauty conceals steel, that the ceremony rests on force"
- *Don't write:* "official in robes" → *Write:* "the chancellor in robes of office that cost a village's yearly income, the chain of state around her neck bearing the seals of three kings, her position at the throne's right hand marking her as the voice that carries royal will to the waiting kingdom"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Governments
- **Elevation hierarchy:** The ruler raised above all, advisors on lesser steps, petitioners below, the vertical organization of power
- **Historical presence:** Portraits of predecessors, battle standards from ancient victories, the throne that has held twenty kings
- **Legitimacy display:** The crown and regalia, the charter of founding, the symbols that prove the right to rule
- **Administrative reality:** Clerks and scribes, seals and documents, the bureaucracy that makes orders into action
- **Guard presence:** The military aspect of power, the reminder that authority is ultimately backed by force
- **Petitioner's journey:** The long approach, the waiting, the ritual of access that reinforces the power of those who grant it

### Seat of Power
The throne room, council chamber, or government hall where authority is exercised and displayed.

**Template:**
> [Space with meaning—e.g., "the Throne Hall of the High King, where the realm's fate has been decided since the dynasty's founding five centuries ago"]. [Architectural authority—e.g., "a chamber one hundred feet long and half as wide, the ceiling vaulted in stone that seems to float, the walls alternating between windows of colored glass and panels painted with the realm's history—a space designed to diminish those who enter and exalt the throne"]. [The seat of power—e.g., "the Iron Throne rising at the hall's far end, seven steps above the floor so every petitioner must look up, the ancient wood and iron carved with the deeds of kings, the crown cushion where sixty monarchs have sat in judgment; behind it the great banner of the realm, larger than a house, the lion and sun that every subject knows"]. [Supporting authority—e.g., "the council lords in their lesser chairs along the dais, each position marking rank, the chancellor at the throne's right hand, the high marshal at the left; below them the court in ranked rows, nobles and officials arrayed in the precedence their families have guarded for generations"]. [Guard presence—e.g., "the royal guard in armor of silver and gold lining the walls at attention, their ceremonial appearance concealing weapons that have drawn blood, their positions unchanged since the hall was first used for audience"]. [Ceremony in progress—e.g., "a delegation approaching down the long carpet, their steps measured by protocol, gifts carried before them, the herald's voice echoing as he announces their purpose to a hall that falls silent at the throne's slightest gesture"]. [Light and atmosphere—e.g., "morning light through the eastern windows casting the throne in radiance, the petitioners in their own shadow, the gold and crimson of the decoration warm as blood, the particular hush of power contemplating those who seek its favor"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on architecture, heraldry, and ceremonial elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy throne room illustration" or "Fantasy royal court audience scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Heraldry/Symbol
The coat of arms, seal, or banner that represents the government's authority.

**Template:**
> [Symbol with weight—e.g., "the Great Seal of the Kingdom, the mark that makes a law binding and a command unquestionable"]. [Physical form—e.g., "the seal cast in gold and silver, the size of a man's palm, mounted in ebony and kept in the chancellor's possession at all times; its impression in red wax appears on every royal decree, every noble patent, every treaty that binds the realm"]. [Design elements—e.g., "the crowned lion rampant on a field divided between sun and star, the border of oak leaves for strength, the motto 'Justice and Valor' in the ancient tongue around the edge—every element debated by heralds five centuries ago and unchanged since"]. [Craftsmanship—e.g., "the fine detail that only master goldsmiths could achieve, every hair of the lion's mane distinct, every leaf of the border precise, the letters sharp enough to impress clearly through wax and parchment"]. [History visible—e.g., "the wear on the handle where a thousand chancellors have held it, the slight variations where the seal has been repaired after attempts to steal or counterfeit it, the scratches that record the physical history of the kingdom's authority"]. [Context of use—e.g., "the seal pressed into hot wax on a parchment of state, the chancellor's hands visible performing the ritual that transforms paper into law, the ribbon of royal crimson binding the document, the witness marks of lords who will enforce what the seal commands"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on metalwork and heraldry, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy royal seal illustration" or "Fantasy kingdom heraldry close-up"].
