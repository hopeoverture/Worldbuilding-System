### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on armor, weapons, and banners, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this military force, include:
- **Unit cohesion:** Uniform equipment, coordinated movement, the visible bonds forged by training and battle
- **Martial discipline:** Formations that speak of drill, equipment maintained to standard, the order that military life demands
- **Warrior identity:** The symbols, colors, and equipment that mark this force as distinct, pride expressed in posture and display
- **Battle readiness:** Weapons accessible, armor worn properly, the constant preparation for violence
- **Hierarchy visible:** Officers distinguished by insignia and position, the chain of command made physical
- **History carried:** Worn equipment that has seen campaigns, battle honors displayed, the dead remembered on standards

### Military Integration (Armies Are Violence Organized)
Every element should express the force's purpose, discipline, and martial culture:
- *Don't write:* "soldiers in formation" → *Write:* "the line standing in ranks three deep, each man an arm's length from the next, shields overlapping in the wall that has broken charges from the Greymarsh to the Iron Coast—the formation drilled until it's instinct, until movement becomes collective, until the unit is a single organism"
- *Don't write:* "commander on horseback" → *Write:* "the general on the white mare that officers of the Third have ridden for six generations, her position at the ridge crest placing her in view of every soldier, banner-bearer at her shoulder so the standard catches the wind, her mere presence meaning stand fast, hold the line, victory is coming"
- *Don't write:* "banners and standards" → *Write:* "the regimental colors streaming in the morning wind, the golden lion on crimson field embroidered by the widows of fallen soldiers, battle honors stitched below in thread of silver—Blackwater Ford, the Siege of Thornhold, the Defense of the Pass—every man willing to die before seeing them fall"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Military Forces
- **Equipment uniformity:** Matching arms and armor that identify the unit, standardization that speaks of resources and discipline
- **Martial posture:** The stance of trained warriors, the patience of professionals, the controlled aggression of those waiting for orders
- **Unit pride:** Distinctive elements that mark elite status, campaign decorations, the trophies of victory
- **Command presence:** Officers positioned for visibility and control, the geometry of command made physical
- **Battle damage:** Scarred shields, dented helms, the evidence of conflicts survived
- **Logistical reality:** Supply wagons, camp followers, the infrastructure that keeps armies in the field

### Formation/Unit
The military force assembled—whether on parade, in camp, or ready for battle.

**Template:**
> [Unit with identity—e.g., "the Iron Guard of Valdris, the heavy infantry that has held the border for three generations"]. [Formation with purpose—e.g., "formed in the line of battle on the training field, three ranks of armored soldiers stretching the length of the parade ground, each man in his assigned position, the formation tight enough that their shields touch, loose enough that weapons can swing"]. [Equipment with uniformity—e.g., "half-plate armor blackened to prevent glare, helms with the lion crest of Valdris, tower shields emblazoned with the silver sun, spears held vertical in perfect alignment—the equipment of a unit that takes pride in standards"]. [Officers visible—e.g., "the captain at the line's center, her plume of white marking her position, mounted officers at either flank ready to relay commands, sergeants positioned behind each section to correct any flaw in formation"]. [Standards and identity—e.g., "the regiment's colors carried at the center, the battle-worn fabric showing three years of campaign, the battle honors visible even at distance, smaller pennons marking each company"]. [Discipline shown—e.g., "absolute stillness except for breathing, eyes forward, the particular patience of professionals who have learned to wait, the tension of controlled readiness"]. [Setting and atmosphere—e.g., "morning mist burning off the training field, the fortress walls rising behind, the sun catching the metal in a forest of gleaming points, the ground trembling slightly as the horses of the officer corps shift their weight"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on armor, weapons, and banners, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy heavy infantry formation illustration" or "Fantasy military unit parade scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Banner/Standard
The symbol that men follow into battle and die to protect.

**Template:**
> [Standard with history—e.g., "the colors of the Iron Guard, carried into every battle the regiment has fought for two hundred years"]. [Physical form—e.g., "a banner of crimson silk six feet tall and four wide, mounted on a staff of ironwood capped with the silver sun of Valdris, the fabric heavy with embroidery and the weight of history"]. [Design elements—e.g., "the golden lion rampant on crimson field, the beast's claws and teeth picked out in silver thread, the border of oak leaves representing the forest homeland, the motto 'Hold Until Death' in gold letters along the bottom"]. [Battle honors—e.g., "below the main device, the names of battles where the regiment distinguished itself, each stitched by the widows of the fallen—twelve names in silver thread, the oldest faded nearly illegible, the newest still bright"]. [Campaign wear—e.g., "the silk showing the tears and stains of three years' campaign, patches visible where holes have been repaired, a dark stain at one corner that veterans say is the blood of the color-bearer at Thornhold who died rather than let it fall"]. [Context—e.g., "the banner carried at the head of a marching column, the bearer a sergeant chosen for the honor, two guards flanking with drawn swords, the standard catching the wind and streaming out so every man behind can see what he fights for"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on fabric and embroidery, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy military standard illustration" or "Fantasy regiment colors battle scene"].
