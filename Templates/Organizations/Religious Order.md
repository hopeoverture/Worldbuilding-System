> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a religious order, create an organized faith institution with clear doctrine, hierarchy, and purpose. Include the beliefs that drive members, the rituals that bind them, and the worldly power they wield. Religious orders should feel like living traditions with internal debates, political entanglements, and genuine spiritual dimension.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this order's identity—what deity or principle they serve, their role in society, and what makes them distinctive among religious institutions.
