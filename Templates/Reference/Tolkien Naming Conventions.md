# Tolkien Naming Conventions

> [!info] Reference Guide
> Linguistic patterns inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's constructed languages for high fantasy naming. These patterns create authentic-feeling names for elves, dwarves, places, and artifacts.

## Overview

Tolkien created multiple languages with distinct phonetic rules. The main languages useful for fantasy naming are:

| Language | Used For | Feel |
|----------|----------|------|
| Sindarin | Grey Elves, most elven names | Flowing, Welsh-like |
| Quenya | High Elves, ancient/formal names | Majestic, Latin/Finnish-like |
| Khuzdul | Dwarves | Semitic, secret, harsh |
| Black Speech | Orcs, evil places | Harsh, ugly, threatening |
| Westron | Hobbits, common folk | Old English, familiar |
| Rohirric | Horse-lords, warriors | Anglo-Saxon, strong |
| Adunaic | Numenoreans, ancient humans | Egyptian/Babylonian feel |

## Construction Tips

1. **Layer meanings:** Tolkien names often have 2-3 elements with meaning
2. **Sound matters:** Names should "sound right" for their culture
3. **Consistency:** All names from one culture should share phonetic patterns
4. **Evolution:** Names can be adapted between languages (Barad-dur = Lugburz)
5. **Simplify for use:** Create pronounceable versions for the table
6. **Honor the source:** Follow the linguistic rules, don't just mash syllables
