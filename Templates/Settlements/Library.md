> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a library, create a repository of knowledge with distinct character, valuable collections, and interesting politics. Consider who maintains it, what treasures it holds, who can access it, and what secrets lie within its stacks. Libraries should feel like places where knowledge has power—institutions with their own cultures, rivalries, and hidden depths.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this library's identity—its collection focus, reputation, accessibility, and what makes it significant to scholars and adventurers.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on books, shelves, and architectural elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this library, include:
- **Knowledge accumulation visible:** Books and scrolls in quantity that suggests lifetimes of collection, organized systems for retrieval, the weight of preserved wisdom
- **Architectural reverence:** Spaces designed to honor knowledge—reading rooms like temples, vaulted ceilings, light treated as sacred
- **Temporal depth:** Different eras of books visible, older sections different from newer, the library as archaeological record
- **Working institution:** Scholars at study, librarians at cataloging, the constant process of preservation and access
- **Light as tool:** Reading light carefully managed, protected from sun damage, the balance between visibility and preservation
- **Silence made visible:** The hushed atmosphere, absorbed sound, the particular quality of space where knowledge is consumed

### Library Integration (Libraries Are Time Made Accessible)
Every element should suggest the vast accumulation and careful preservation of knowledge:
- *Don't write:* "bookshelves to the ceiling" → *Write:* "shelves rising forty feet, the upper reaches accessible only by brass-railed galleries and wheeled ladders, the books at the top showing less wear because fewer scholars make the climb—the restricted texts, the dangerous knowledge, the works that reward persistence"
- *Don't write:* "scholars reading" → *Write:* "scholars hunched over ancient texts with magnifying glasses and note-taking slates, the particular posture of deep concentration, some surrounded by piles of referenced works, others frozen mid-page with the look of discovery or confusion"
- *Don't write:* "old books" → *Write:* "leather bindings cracked with age, gilt titles worn to whispers, some volumes chained to their shelves against theft, others locked behind glass against time itself—the smell of old paper and preservation oils, the dust that accumulates between rare consultations"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Libraries
- **Collection variety:** Massive tomes, delicate scrolls, tablet collections, map cases, curiosity cabinets, specimen jars containing things scholars need to see
- **Access infrastructure:** Reading desks with built-in book rests, special lighting for manuscript work, standing desks for map consultation, private carrels for sensitive research
- **Preservation evidence:** Climate control (magical or mechanical), restoration workshops visible, damaged texts carefully stored, the ongoing battle against decay
- **Organization systems:** Card catalogs, shelf marks, color coding, chained sections, locked cases, the visible logic of retrieval
- **Scholar life:** Coffee cups and sandwich remnants, blankets for cold evenings, favorite seats worn by repeated use, notes left in margins
- **Power structures:** Librarian stations commanding views, restricted area barriers, the hierarchy of access made physical

### Reading Room
The public face of the library—the grand space where scholars access the collection and knowledge is consumed.

**Template:**
> [Space with character—e.g., "the Great Reading Room of the Astral Library, where the accumulated knowledge of three civilizations sits waiting for those patient enough to find it"]. [Architectural presence—e.g., "a domed chamber sixty feet across, the walls lined with books from floor to the gallery level, then from gallery to the clerestory, then from clerestory to the dome itself—each level accessible by spiral stairs, the upper reaches reserved for those with the credentials to climb"]. [Light management—e.g., "the dome's oculus admitting a controlled shaft of daylight that moves across the room with the hours, supplemented by brass reading lamps at each desk, the light warm enough for reading but soft enough for preservation"]. [Furniture and function—e.g., "desks of dark oak arranged in concentric circles around the central catalog station, each desk equipped with a brass lamp, a book rest, and a bell to summon the page; the leather chairs worn to perfect comfort by generations of scholarly posteriors"]. [Scholars at work—e.g., "a dozen readers scattered through the room, some surrounded by piles of referenced works, others staring at a single page with the intensity of revelation, one sleeping with his face on an open book, drool threatening the margin"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular silence of concentrated study, broken only by the turn of pages, the scratch of pens, the distant sound of cart wheels in the stacks; dust motes drifting in the shaft of light from above"]. [Details—e.g., "the busts of famous scholars gazing down from niches, the memorial plaques on endowed desks, the collection boxes for the maintenance fund"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on books, shelves, and architectural elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy grand library reading room illustration" or "Fantasy repository of knowledge illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Archives/Stacks
The deep collection—the endless rows where knowledge waits for seekers.

**Template:**
> [Location in the depths—e.g., "the third level of the Restricted Stacks, where the texts require special permission and the knowledge grows increasingly dangerous with each step down"]. [Shelf immensity—e.g., "rows of shelves stretching beyond the reach of the light, the aisles narrow enough that two scholars cannot pass, the shelves rising to a ceiling lost in shadow—the visible fraction of a collection that would take lifetimes to read"]. [Book variety—e.g., "ancient codices bound in leather cracked with age sharing shelf space with newer printed volumes, scroll cases in honeycomb racks, oversized folios stored flat, tiny books of hours chained to their shelves against theft"]. [Lighting conditions—e.g., "brass lanterns mounted every ten feet, their light adequate for finding but not reading, forcing scholars to carry their finds to the reading desks; the darkness between lamps deep enough to hide anything"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the smell of old paper and leather and the particular must of books that haven't been opened in decades, the silence so complete that one's own heartbeat seems loud, the occasional rustle that might be a page settling or might be something else"]. [Signs of use and neglect—e.g., "some sections clearly browsed often, others thick with dust where the catalog says volumes wait that no one has requested in a generation; a book left on a return cart, forgotten; a ladder left mid-row by a departed scholar"]. [Sense of mystery—e.g., "the awareness that somewhere in these stacks lies knowledge that could change everything, hidden by nothing more than the overwhelming quantity of what must be searched to find it"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on books, shelves, and architectural elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy library deep stacks illustration" or "Fantasy archive labyrinth illustration"].
