> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a library, create a repository of knowledge with distinct character, valuable collections, and interesting politics. Consider who maintains it, what treasures it holds, who can access it, and what secrets lie within its stacks. Libraries should feel like places where knowledge has power—institutions with their own cultures, rivalries, and hidden depths.

## Overview
