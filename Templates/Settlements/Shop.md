### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on merchandise and craftsmanship, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this shop, include:
- **Trade specialty visible:** Merchandise that instantly communicates what's sold here—weapons for an armorer, potions for an apothecary, bolts of cloth for a tailor
- **Quality indicators:** The condition of goods, the care in display, the materials of fixtures—all expressing the shop's tier
- **Craft evidence:** Tools of the trade visible, works in progress, the marks of making things by hand
- **Proprietor presence:** The owner or staff as center of the space, their expertise implied by their confidence and positioning
- **Customer journey:** The flow from entrance to browse to consultation to purchase, the shop designed for commerce
- **Accumulated character:** Years of trade leaving marks—worn counters, favorite spots, displays that have evolved with fashion

### Shop Integration (Shops Are Craft Made Visible)
Every element should express the trade practiced and the proprietor's relationship with their goods:
- *Don't write:* "shelves of merchandise" → *Write:* "shelves displaying the armourer's art in steel and iron—finished helms arranged by style and size, breastplates hanging on wooden forms, shields propped in a row showing different heraldic patterns, each piece positioned to catch the light and tempt the eye of a warrior with coin to spend"
- *Don't write:* "merchant behind the counter" → *Write:* "the proprietor behind her counter like a captain on her quarterdeck, hands resting on the worn oak where a thousand transactions have polished the wood smooth, eyes tracking every customer with the assessment of someone who knows the difference between browsers and buyers"
- *Don't write:* "work area in the back" → *Write:* "the workshop glimpsed through the doorway behind the counter—the forge still glowing, the anvil with a half-finished blade waiting, the tools arranged by a lifetime of habit, the smell of metal and oil and honest work drifting into the selling space"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Shops
- **Trade markers:** Tools of the craft on display, raw materials visible, works in progress that invite questions
- **Display craft:** How goods are arranged—by price, by quality, by type, by customer segment—the strategy made visible
- **Security measures:** Valuable items behind glass or counter, the strongbox visible, the way staff watch browsers
- **Customer comfort:** Seats for waiting, mirrors for trying, good light for examining, the conveniences that encourage purchase
- **Negotiation spaces:** The counter where deals are struck, private rooms for significant transactions, the physical choreography of commerce
- **Proprietor personality:** Framed credentials, personal touches, the arrangement reflecting taste and philosophy

### Shop Interior
The sales floor where craft meets commerce—the merchandise displayed, the proprietor ready.

**Template:**
> [Shop type with character—e.g., "the showroom of Master Aldric's Armory, where three generations of smiths have equipped the city's guards and nobles alike"]. [Merchandise display—e.g., "walls hung with the armorer's art—finished helms on wooden heads arranged by style and price, breastplates on stands showing different designs from practical to ceremonial, shields propped in rows, weapons locked in glass cases with the keys on the master's belt"]. [Quality evidence—e.g., "the steel gleaming from careful maintenance, not a spot of rust on any piece, the leather straps supple with regular oiling, the display forms of polished wood—everything speaking of care that extends from making to selling"]. [Proprietor or staff—e.g., "Master Aldric himself behind the oak counter, hands resting on wood worn smooth by a century of transactions, appraising each customer with the eye of someone who knows exactly what they need before they speak"]. [Workshop connection—e.g., "the doorway to the forge behind the counter, the glow of the fire visible, the sound of hammer on metal as an apprentice works, the smell of hot iron and quenching oil drifting into the showroom"]. [Light and atmosphere—e.g., "daylight through the front windows supplemented by brass lamps positioned to catch the gleam of polished steel, the space warm from the forge, dust motes drifting in the light shafts"]. [Customer presence—e.g., "a young knight examining the helms with poorly concealed anxiety, a merchant's guard waiting while his commission is finished, a woman testing the balance of a rapier with suspiciously practiced ease"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on merchandise and craftsmanship, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy armorer shop interior illustration" or "Fantasy blacksmith showroom illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Storefront
The shop as seen from the street—the public face of the trade.

**Template:**
> [Shop in street context—e.g., "the storefront of Master Aldric's Armory on Smiths' Row, where the sound of hammering and the smell of hot metal define the district"]. [Building character—e.g., "a solid timber-framed structure wider than it is tall, the ground floor open to the street in good weather, iron shutters folded back to display the wares, the upper floors leaning out over the street in the old style"]. [Signage—e.g., "the great sign of a crossed sword and hammer, forged iron not painted wood, creaking on chains thick enough to moor a ship—a sign that is itself advertisement for the smith's skill"]. [Window display—e.g., "the best pieces in the front window, a ceremonial helm that catches every passing eye, a breastplate engraved with the city's arms, weapons that promise quality to any customer with the price"]. [Street activity—e.g., "a customer emerging with a wrapped package, a delivery boy struggling with a crate of raw steel, the neighboring shops showing their own wares—the leather worker, the sword-sharpener, the whole economy of violence on display"]. [Trade district atmosphere—e.g., "the sound of hammering from a dozen forges, the smell of metal and coal smoke, the particular bustle of craftsmen and customers, the guards who patrol this wealthy street"]. [Time and light—e.g., "midday sun catching the displayed steel, the shadows of the overhanging upper floors, the warmth of a summer day when the forge heat makes the shop interior almost unbearable"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy armorer storefront illustration" or "Fantasy craft shop street scene"].
