### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on wood grain, metalwork, and atmospheric effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this tavern, include:
- **Warmth and welcome:** The tavern as refuge from the road or the weather, light and heat spilling outward, the promise of food and drink and company
- **Lived-in character:** Furniture worn by use, walls darkened by smoke, the accumulation of years of stories and spilled drinks
- **Social layering:** Different groups in their customary spots, the regulars' corner, the strangers' table, the serving paths between
- **Sensory richness:** Food and drink visible, smoke and steam in the air, the visual suggestion of smell and taste and sound
- **Proprietor presence:** The bar as command center, the innkeeper's personality expressed in decor and arrangement
- **Story potential:** The corner where deals are made, the table where strangers eye each other, the dark booth where secrets pass

### Tavern Integration (Taverns Are Stories Waiting to Happen)
Every element should suggest the social dynamics and narrative potential of the space:
- *Don't write:* "wooden tables and chairs" → *Write:* "tables scarred by a thousand knife games and carved with the initials of patrons long dead, chairs whose legs have been shortened and balanced so many times each one sits differently, the furniture a record of every celebration and brawl the tavern has hosted"
- *Don't write:* "fire in the hearth" → *Write:* "the great fireplace that is the tavern's heart, flames dancing on logs as thick as a man's thigh, the stone blackened by generations of fires, the warmth reaching every corner of the room while the regulars guard the seats closest to the blaze like territories"
- *Don't write:* "bar with drinks" → *Write:* "the bar of oak planks worn smooth by elbows, the array of bottles and kegs behind it a map of the innkeeper's sources and ambitions, the tap handles each with their own story, the regulars' tankards hanging from hooks with names burned into the wood"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Taverns
- **Character markers:** Hunting trophies on walls, weapons from old fights, the portrait of the founder, the stain where someone famous bled
- **Trade equipment:** The bar itself, the tap system, the bottle collection, the serving tools, the coin box and weights
- **Gathering infrastructure:** The tables arranged for different group sizes, the private booths, the common benches, the bard's corner
- **Atmospheric elements:** Smoke in the rafters, steam from the kitchen, candlelight on faces, the glow from the fire
- **Story evidence:** The notch in the bar from a thrown axe, the table that's always empty, the corner where the locals say a ghost sits
- **Hospitality signs:** Food coming from the kitchen, drinks being poured, the innkeeper's attention, the serving staff in motion

### Common Room Interior
The heart of the tavern—where travelers meet, deals are made, and adventures begin.

**Template:**
> [Establishment with character—e.g., "the common room of the Broken Drum, where half the city's adventuring stories have begun and at least as many have ended in blood or laughter"]. [Spatial arrangement—e.g., "a low-ceilinged room of smoke-darkened beams and stone walls, the great fireplace dominating the north wall, tables scattered without pattern across the uneven flagstone floor, the bar running along the west side where the innkeeper can watch everything while appearing to focus on her pour"]. [Furniture with history—e.g., "tables of different sizes and ages, some scarred by knife games and carved with initials, others clearly replacements for furniture that didn't survive the last brawl; chairs that each sit at a slightly different height; benches along the walls worn smooth by sitting"]. [The fire—e.g., "flames dancing on logs as thick as a man's leg, the warmth reaching the far corners, the regulars occupying the choice seats nearest the hearth, their tankards kept filled by serving girls who know their names and orders"]. [The bar—e.g., "oak planks worn smooth by generations of elbows, the brass rail at foot level polished by boots, the back bar an array of kegs and bottles that speak to the innkeeper's connections and ambitions"]. [Patrons—e.g., "a mix of regulars and travelers, the locals obvious by their territorial certainty, the strangers obvious by their watchfulness; a party of adventurers taking a corner table and speaking too quietly for the topic to be honest; a lone man nursing a drink that's been refilled too many times"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "smoke drifting in the rafters, the smell of roasting meat and spilled ale and wet wool drying, the sound of a dozen conversations and the occasional burst of laughter, the particular warmth that only exists in public houses on cold nights"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on wood grain, metalwork, and atmospheric effects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy tavern common room illustration" or "Fantasy inn interior scene"].

**Prompt:**


### Exterior View
The tavern as seen from the street—the promise of warmth, drink, and company.

**Template:**
> [Tavern in context—e.g., "the Broken Drum on a winter evening, when the light from the windows is more welcoming than any sign"]. [Building character—e.g., "a building that has settled into its foundations over two centuries of hospitality, the timber frame slightly bowed, the thatch patched in a dozen places, the walls whitewashed over plaster over stone—the structure expressing its age in every line while remaining somehow welcoming"]. [The sign—e.g., "the painted sign creaking on its iron bracket, a cracked drum that hasn't been repainted in anyone's memory, the image faded but still readable by the light of the lantern hung beside the door"]. [Light and warmth—e.g., "warm light spilling from the windows onto the cobblestones, casting golden rectangles that promise heat and company; smoke rising from the chimney, carrying the smell of roasting meat"]. [Activity—e.g., "a patron pushing through the door, releasing a gust of warm air and the sound of laughter; a couple emerging arm in arm; horses tied to the rail outside, their breath steaming"]. [Street context—e.g., "neighboring buildings dark and shuttered for the night, the tavern the only point of light and life on the winter street, the street lamps struggling against the cold while the tavern windows blaze"]. [Weather and time—e.g., "snow beginning to dust the thatch and cobbles, the early darkness of winter, the particular quality of evening when the choice between warmth and cold becomes pressing"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy tavern exterior winter scene" or "Fantasy inn street view illustration"].
