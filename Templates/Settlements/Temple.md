Temples should feel like living religious institutions with daily rhythms, political influence, and spiritual significance.

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on religious architecture and sacred objects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this temple, include:
- **Sacred architecture:** Structures designed to inspire awe and humility, proportions that make mortals feel small before the divine
- **Deity reflection:** Every element expressing the nature of the god served—war temples massive and martial, death temples shadowed and solemn, life temples filled with light and growing things
- **Ritual focus:** The altar as spiritual center, sight lines drawing the eye to sacred objects, processional spaces, clergy domains
- **Light as theology:** Illumination as divine presence—stained glass painting worshippers in colored light, candles as prayers made visible, darkness as mystery or fear
- **Accumulated devotion:** Centuries of offerings, worn stone where pilgrims kneel, incense smoke staining ceilings, the weight of countless prayers
- **Living practice:** Clergy in vestments, worshippers at devotion, the temple as a working institution not a museum

### Temple Integration (Temples Are Faith Made Stone)
Every architectural and decorative element should express the deity's nature and the congregation's devotion:
- *Don't write:* "altar with candles" → *Write:* "the high altar of black marble veined with gold, rising from the sanctuary floor like a dark wave frozen at the moment of breaking, a hundred candles burning on its stepped surface—each flame a prayer carried heavenward in smoke that has stained the ceiling above for three centuries of devotion"
- *Don't write:* "stained glass windows" → *Write:* "windows telling the god's story in glass and light—the birth of the faith in the east window catching the morning sun, the martyrdom of the saints in the north window glowing blood-red at noon, the promise of paradise in the west window set ablaze each sunset"
- *Don't write:* "religious statues" → *Write:* "the goddess rising twenty feet from the sanctuary floor, carved from a single block of white marble dragged from mountains three hundred miles distant, her face serene yet terrible, her hands raised in blessing or warning depending on where you stand, gold leaf on her robes worn thin by the touch of pilgrims' hands over generations"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Temples
- **Divine presence markers:** Eternal flames, sacred springs, relics in crystal, altars stained by centuries of offering, spaces where the air feels different
- **Devotional infrastructure:** Kneeling stones worn smooth, offering boxes overflowing, votive tablets covering walls, pilgrims' graffiti carved into columns
- **Ritual equipment:** Censers trailing smoke, chalices and patens on display, vestments in cases, processional items in alcoves
- **Hierarchical spaces:** Common worship areas giving way to restricted sanctuaries, clergy-only doors, hidden chambers for mysteries
- **Temporal markers:** Morning light designed to strike the altar, seasonal alignments with windows, festival decorations or absence thereof
- **Sound design:** Acoustic spaces that amplify chanting, bells visible in towers, silence zones, echo chambers

### Temple Interior
The sanctuary and worship spaces where mortals encounter the divine.

**Template:**
> [Location with spiritual weight—e.g., "the sanctuary of the Temple of the Radiant Dawn, where the morning sun has struck the high altar for a thousand years without fail"]. [Architectural scale—e.g., "a nave that rises sixty feet to a vaulted ceiling, the stone ribs meeting at carved bosses showing the sun in every phase, the proportions designed to make every worshipper feel small before the divine—and yet welcomed, protected, embraced by the faith"]. [Sacred focus—e.g., "the altar of gold-leafed marble at the sanctuary's heart, the eternal flame burning in its bronze basin, smoke rising to join the centuries of soot that has darkened the dome above—three thousand years of prayers made visible"]. [Light and illumination—e.g., "the great rose window filling the eastern wall, its glass depicting the god's triumph over darkness, the morning light streaming through in shafts of gold and rose that move across the nave floor as the sun rises, reaching the altar at the moment of the dawn prayer"]. [Devotional elements—e.g., "side chapels dark with candle smoke, votive offerings piled on secondary altars, pilgrims' tablets covering every inch of wall space not claimed by frescos faded with age"]. [Human presence—e.g., "a priest in gold-embroidered vestments preparing the altar for morning service, a penitent kneeling alone in a side chapel, the echo of distant chanting from the chapter house"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the smell of incense and old stone and candle wax, the particular quality of light that exists only in sacred spaces, the silence that seems to deepen rather than simply exist"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on religious architecture and sacred objects, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy sun temple interior illustration" or "Fantasy sacred sanctuary illustration"].

**Prompt:**


### Temple Exterior
The temple rising from its surroundings, declaring faith through architecture.

**Template:**
> [Temple in context—e.g., "the Temple of the Radiant Dawn rising above the rooftops of Thronehold, its golden dome visible for miles, the beacon that has guided travelers and reminded the city of divine presence for ten generations"]. [Architectural presence—e.g., "the temple complex covering three city blocks, the main sanctuary a cruciform of white marble and gold leaf, the dome rising two hundred feet and surmounted by a bronze sun that catches the light at dawn and dusk"]. [Sacred geometry—e.g., "the building aligned precisely east-west so that the rising sun enters through the great doors on the holiest days, the spires at each corner marking the cardinal points, every proportion expressing divine mathematics"]. [Approach and grounds—e.g., "the wide steps where pilgrims gather for dawn prayers, the courtyard fountains where the faithful wash before entering, gardens of sacred herbs tended by acolytes, the wall that separates holy ground from the secular city"]. [Religious activity—e.g., "worshippers ascending the steps for morning service, a wedding party emerging through the great doors, a funeral procession approaching from the north gate, priests in white robes moving between buildings"]. [Surroundings—e.g., "the city pressing close on three sides, buildings kept low by ancient decree so nothing may overshadow the temple, the palace visible in the distance but clearly subordinate in height and grandeur"]. [Light and atmosphere—e.g., "the first light of dawn turning the dome to fire, long shadows stretching west, the particular quality of early morning when the sacred and mundane have not yet separated"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy temple complex establishing shot" or "Fantasy cathedral exterior illustration"].
