### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate architectural and environmental detail, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Guidelines
When generating AI art for this village, include:
- **Landscape integration:** Buildings that belong to their environment, using local materials, shaped by local weather, part of the terrain rather than imposed upon it
- **Economy visible:** Fields or pastures, fishing boats, logging operations, mines—whatever feeds and justifies the village's existence
- **Generational permanence:** Buildings that have been repaired rather than replaced, trees that were planted by grandparents, paths worn by daily use over decades
- **Community scale:** Small enough that everyone knows everyone, large enough to sustain essential services, intimate rather than anonymous
- **Life rhythms:** Time of day reflected in activity—morning work, midday rest, evening gathering
- **Weather and season:** Climate effects on buildings and people, seasonal activities visible, the village responding to its environment

### Village Integration (Villages Are Landscapes Made Human)
Every element should suggest the village's organic relationship with its land and people:
- *Don't write:* "thatched cottages" → *Write:* "cottages that seem to grow from the land itself, their walls of local stone and cob, roofs of thatch harvested from the same fields the villagers farm, each one slightly different because each was built by its owner's hands with help from neighbors now long buried"
- *Don't write:* "village green" → *Write:* "the common ground that has been the village's heart since the founding, the grass worn bare where children play and markets gather, the old oak at its center providing shade for gossip and judgment, the well that serves as excuse and destination for every daily conversation"
- *Don't write:* "farmland around the village" → *Write:* "fields that have been carved from the forest over generations, each stone wall representing a year's clearing work, the strips following the land's contours in patterns that make sense only to those who work them, the boundary between human order and wild nature always visible at the forest's edge"

### Distinctive Feature Ideas for Villages
- **Material honesty:** Buildings of whatever the land provides—stone in hills, timber in forests, cob and thatch where nothing else grows
- **Organic layout:** Buildings clustered by logic of terrain, paths following desire lines, no grid or plan, growth by accretion
- **Life evidence:** Smoke rising, laundry drying, animals wandering, gardens behind cottages, tools leaning against walls
- **Community markers:** The well, the green, the old tree, the shrine, the tavern—places that gather people
- **Work visible:** Fields, pastures, boats, nets, lumber, forges—the economy that justifies existence
- **Age and repair:** Nothing new, everything maintained, patches visible, adaptations to changing needs

### Exterior (Wide Shot)
Establishing shot showing the full village in its landscape, capturing its intimate scale and relationship to the land.

**Template:**
> [Village in landscape—e.g., "the village of Millbrook seen from the hill road, tucked into the valley where the stream bends and the forest gives way to cleared land"]. [Building description—e.g., "two dozen cottages of grey stone and golden thatch clustered around the village green, each one built by the hands of ancestors using stones cleared from the same fields that now feed the village"]. [Central feature—e.g., "the ancient oak at the green's heart, its spreading branches shading the well and the worn stone where the village has gathered for judgments and celebrations since before memory"]. [Economy visible—e.g., "fields striping the valley floor in the last green of summer, sheep dotting the hillside pasture, the mill wheel turning in the stream where the village gets its name"]. [Life signs—e.g., "smoke rising from chimneys where the midday meal is being prepared, a child chasing geese across the green, a cart returning from the fields with the day's cut"]. [Surroundings—e.g., "the forest a dark wall on three sides, the road a pale thread winding down from the hills, the stream glittering through the watermeadows"]. [Time and atmosphere—e.g., "golden afternoon light warming the thatch to honey, long shadows beginning to stretch from the western hills, the particular peace of a day's work nearly done"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate architectural and environmental detail, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy rural village landscape illustration" or "Fantasy pastoral settlement establishing shot"].

**Prompt:**


### Interior (Street Level)
Ground-level view immersed in the village center, showing the intimate scale and daily rhythms of rural life.

**Template:**
> [Location specifics—e.g., "the village green of Millbrook at the hour when the day's work pauses for the midday meal"]. [Architectural intimacy—e.g., "cottages facing the green with doors standing open to catch the breeze, each one different yet all clearly kin—stone walls whitewashed or bare, thatch new on some and mossy on others, small windows with real glass here and wooden shutters there"]. [Central feature—e.g., "the oak tree that has shaded this spot since the village's founding, its trunk wide enough that three men couldn't link hands around it, its roots humping through the grass that children use as seats and elders use as backrests"]. [Village life—e.g., "a goodwife carrying a bucket from the well, pausing to exchange words with the smith's wife; an old man dozing on the bench outside the tavern; chickens scratching in the dust of the path; a dog sleeping in a patch of sun"]. [Detail texture—e.g., "the worn stones of the well curb polished by a thousand hands, the path between cottages packed smooth by daily feet, gardens behind fences of woven willow, herbs drying in bunches under eaves"]. [Economy hints—e.g., "the smell of baking bread from the cottage with the larger chimney, farm tools leaning against walls waiting for the afternoon's work, a fishing net spread for mending"]. [Atmosphere—e.g., "the particular quiet of midday when work pauses, the drone of bees in the cottage gardens, the distant bleat of sheep on the hillside, peace that has been earned by the morning's labor"]. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate architectural and environmental detail, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. [Thematic tag—e.g., "Fantasy village green scene illustration" or "Fantasy rural community life illustration"].
