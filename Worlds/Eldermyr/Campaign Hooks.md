# Eldermyr Campaign Hooks

Adventure starters for parties entering Eldermyr. Organized by theme, level range, and faction involvement.

## Starting Scenarios

### The Heir's Shadow (Levels 1-5)
**Hook:** The party is hired by [[Lord Varic Valdren]] to escort a "merchant's son" through bandit-infested roads to [[Thornhall]]. The boy is quiet, guarded, and watches everything. Halfway there, assassins attack—professional ones, not bandits.

**Revelation:** The "merchant's son" is [[Edric Valdren]], traveling in secret to assess threats outside the capital. Someone knew the route.

**Faction:** Valdren (patron), unknown (enemy)
**Themes:** Protection, intrigue, trust
**Escalation:** Who leaked the route? Was it Thorne, Karath, or someone inside Valdren's household?

---

### The Grey Warden's Request (Levels 3-7)
**Hook:** [[Ser Aldric Cole]], Knight-Commander of [[The Grey Wardens]], sends word to adventurers he's heard of: the order needs help. Their forward outpost in [[The Karath Reach]] has gone silent. He needs someone expendable to investigate.

**Revelation:** The outpost fell to the Risen—not destroyed, but converted. The Wardens there now wear [[The Blackened Crown]]'s mark.

**Faction:** Grey Wardens (patron), The Unnamed (enemy)
**Themes:** Horror, sacrifice, corruption
**Escalation:** Can corrupted Wardens be saved? What did they learn before they fell?

---

### The Thorne Inheritance (Levels 1-5)
**Hook:** One of the party members receives word: a distant relative has died, leaving them property in [[House Thorne]] territory. It's a minor estate, but it comes with a title—and enemies.

**Revelation:** The "inheritance" is a trap. The previous owner was investigating something [[Lady Margret Thorne]] wanted buried. Now the party owns the evidence.

**Faction:** Thorne (antagonist)
**Themes:** Land, secrets, political danger
**Escalation:** What did the previous owner discover? Why did Thorne want them dead?

---

### The Karath Whispers (Levels 5-10)
**Hook:** Refugees from [[The Karath Reach]] are flooding into [[Crossford]]. Among them is a woman who claims to have escaped [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s inner circle. She'll trade what she knows for protection from what's following her.

**Revelation:** She's [[Yelena Karath]]'s former handmaiden. She knows [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] serves [[The Unnamed]] willingly—and that something is being built in the mass graves.

**Faction:** Karath (enemy), potentially all others (interested)
**Themes:** Refugees, intelligence, dark secrets
**Escalation:** Is the woman telling the truth? Or is she a plant by Yelena to spread disinformation?

---

## Faction Missions

### For House Valdren
- **Silence a Witness:** Someone in [[Port Corsair]] knows how [[High King Aldric II]] really died. Make sure they don't talk.
- **Marriage Games:** Escort a Valdren daughter to meet a potential husband from a neutral house. Ensure no "accidents."
- **The Heir's Education:** Accompany [[Edric Valdren]] on his first official tour. Protect him—and report what he says in private.

- **The Orc Question:** Thorne's orc mercenaries are getting restless. Investigate what's making them nervous in the mountains.
- **Dwarf Diplomacy:** Travel to [[Hammerhall]] and ensure [[Grimhild the Smith]] prioritizes Thorne's commissions.

### For House Karath
- **Recover the Relic:** An artifact from before [[The Great War]] lies in a Valdren estate. Retrieve it without starting a war. Yet.
- **Contact the Dead:** Bring a medium to [[The Ashen Fields]]. [[Lord Draven Karath]] wants to speak with his fallen soldiers.
- **Silence the Rumors:** Investigate the stories about Risen in Karath lands. Make the investigation conclude nothing is wrong.

### For The Faith of the Three
- **Heretic Hunt:** [[High Confessor Maren]] has identified a nest of demon-worshippers. Cleanse it. Don't ask too many questions.
- **Divine Signs:** Escort a vision-touched priest to [[The Ashen Fields]]. Record everything he sees.

## Horror Scenarios

### The Village That Woke (Levels 5-10)
A village in [[The Karath Reach]] stopped sending tax payments. When investigators arrived, everyone was dead—then got back up. Now the Risen villagers continue their daily routines: farming, trading, marrying. They don't seem to know they're dead.

**Objective:** Discover what happened. Determine if they can be saved—or if they must be destroyed.

---

### The Crown in Dreams (Levels 7-12)
Party members begin sharing the same dream: a field of corpses, a figure with a crown of blackened iron, and a voice asking what they would sacrifice for power. Each night, the dreams grow more vivid. Each night, the figure comes closer.

**Objective:** Discover why they're being contacted. Find a way to block the dreams—or confront what sends them.

---

### The Wedding of the Dead (Levels 5-8)
Invitation arrives for a wedding in a remote Karath estate. The invitation is old—dated from before [[The Great War]]. When the party arrives, they find a celebration in progress: guests in rotting finery, musicians playing silent instruments, a bride and groom who died twenty-three years ago finally completing their interrupted ceremony.

**Objective:** Survive the celebration. Learn what binds these souls. Decide whether to end it or let them have their wedding.

---

## Political Scenarios

### The Neutral House (Levels 3-7)
A minor house has declared strict neutrality—and everyone hates them for it. They're hiring adventurers for protection. But their neutrality hides a secret: they know something about [[High King Aldric II]]'s death that implicates multiple factions.

**Objective:** Protect the family. Decide what to do with their knowledge.

---

### The Tournament of Succession (Levels 5-10)
To delay war, the factions agree to a tournament. Champions will compete; the winner's house gains political advantage. The party is recruited as champions—or as saboteurs.

**Objective:** Win (or ensure your patron wins). Navigate assassination attempts, bribery, and romance subplots.

---

### The Marriage Alliance (Levels 3-7)
Two houses are negotiating a marriage to bind their alliance. The party is hired to escort the bride. But the bride doesn't want this marriage—and she's not helpless.

**Objective:** Fulfill your contract or help her escape. Both choices have consequences.

---

## Exploration Scenarios

### The Mad King's Vault (Levels 7-12)
[[The Mad King]] built something beneath [[Thornhall]] before his death—a vault no one has been able to open. Now, with his grandson on the throne, the wards are weakening. What did he hide?

**Objective:** Enter the vault. Survive its guardians. Discover what Valdus I thought was worth dying to protect.

---

### The Elven Archives (Levels 5-10)
The elves of [[Myrkvid]] know ancient secrets about [[The Unnamed]]. They won't share freely. But there might be other ways into their archives—ways that don't require permission.

**Objective:** Learn what the elves know. Don't start an interspecies incident.

---

### The Dwarf-Hold Deep (Levels 8-13)
[[Hammerhall]]'s deepest levels were sealed after something was found. [[Grimhild the Smith]] needs materials from those depths to forge her legendary blade. She needs people crazy enough to go down there.

**Objective:** Retrieve the materials. Survive what made the dwarves seal those tunnels.
