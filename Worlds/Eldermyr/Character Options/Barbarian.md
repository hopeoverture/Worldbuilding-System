# Barbarian

> [!info] Class Summary
> Barbarians are fierce warriors fueled by primal rage. In Eldermyr, they hail from the wild places—the frozen [[Northlands]], the mountain tribes of the [[Greycrowns]], and the orc clans of the [[Eastern March]]. Their battle fury makes them devastating frontline fighters.

## Overview

Barbarians channel raw, primal fury into devastating combat prowess. Where fighters train their skills through discipline, barbarians draw power from something deeper—ancestral spirits, primal rage, or an unbreakable connection to the wild. In battle, they become nearly unstoppable juggernauts capable of absorbing punishment that would fell lesser warriors.

## Barbarians in Eldermyr

### Cultural Origins

**The Northlands Berserkers**
The [[Northlands]] produce Eldermyr's most feared barbarians. Tribes worship the Old Ways and believe rage is a gift from the wild spirits. The most legendary berserkers enter a battle-trance called the *Úlfheðinn*—the wolf-fury—where they become one with their ancestral spirit animal. These warriors paint themselves with woad and ash before battle, calling upon the spirits of wolf, bear, and raven.

**Orc Fury-Born**
The [[Orcs]] of the [[Eastern March]] have their own tradition of rage warriors. The Thorne Compact brought orc barbarians into the realm's defense, and they've proven invaluable at [[Ostmark Pass]]. Orc barbarians believe rage comes from *Grahz*, the burning blood—a gift from their ancestors who survived impossible hardships. They are especially devastating against the risen dead, showing no fear against the horrors from [[The Ashen Fields]].

**Goliath Storm-Kin**
[[Goliaths]] of the [[Greycrowns]] and [[Ostmark Range]] produce barbarians who draw power from the mountain storms. They call their rage *Thunarak*—the thunder-walk—and believe they channel lightning itself. Goliath barbarians often follow the Path of the World Tree, viewing the mountains as branches of a great cosmic tree.

**Human Reavers**
The [[Western Shore]] once suffered raids from human barbarians of the outer islands. While most have been absorbed into civilization, some families maintain the old ways. [[Port Corsair]] harbors descendants of these reavers, and desperate times have seen their traditions revived.

### Training Traditions

**The Hunt-Trials**
Northlands barbarians earn their rage through dangerous trials—hunting dire wolves alone, surviving a week in [[Myrkvid]] without supplies, or climbing the highest Greycrown peaks in winter. Those who survive discover their rage awakening.

**The Blood-Oaths**
Orc barbarians undergo the Grahzak ritual, where they're wounded and must channel their pain into fury. Elder orcs judge when the young warrior has truly found their rage. Many orc barbarians serve [[House Thorne]] after completing this rite.

**The Storm-Vigil**
Goliath barbarians climb to the highest peaks during storms and stand in the lightning. Survivors are considered chosen by the mountains themselves.

### Role in the Current Crisis

The succession war has created unprecedented demand for barbarian warriors:

- **Northlands mercenaries** sell their axes to whoever pays, though they favor the [[Grey Wardens]] who respect the Old Ways
- **Orc fury-born** remain loyal to [[House Thorne]], defending the eastern border against threats both living and undead
- **Goliath storm-kin** have begun descending from the mountains, concerned about the rising dead reaching their high valleys
- **Path of the Zealot** barbarians have appeared, claiming divine mandate from [[The Faith of the Three]] to destroy the risen dead

### Social Standing

Barbarians occupy a complex place in Eldermyr society:

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [[The Crown Lands]] | Feared, marginalized, occasionally hired |
| [[The Northlands]] | Honored warriors, cultural heroes |
| [[The Eastern March]] | Respected allies (orcs), valued mercenaries |
| [[The Western Shore]] | Distrusted, associated with piracy |
| [[The Karath Reach]] | Desperately needed against the risen |

The [[Faith of the Three]] technically disapproves of rage as "surrendering reason," but pragmatism has forced acceptance. Some clerics now bless barbarians before battle, calling their fury "righteous wrath."

## Organizations

### The Úlfheðnar Brotherhood
A loose confederation of Northlands barbarians who follow the Path of the Wild Heart. They gather at [[Vindrheim]] during the winter solstice to share tales and renew bonds. [[Ragnar One-Eye]], their informal leader, has been recruiting for the [[Grey Wardens]].

### The Grahzak Guard
Orc barbarians sworn to [[House Thorne]]. They hold [[Ostmark Pass]] with legendary ferocity. [[Warchief Mogra Skullsplitter]] commands them, answering only to [[Lady Margret Thorne]].

### The Storm Walkers
Goliath barbarians who wander between mountain settlements, serving as messengers, judges, and defenders. They've recently begun coordinating with lowland forces against the undead threat.

## Notable Barbarians

| Name | Path | Affiliation |
|------|------|-------------|
| Ragnar One-Eye | Wild Heart (Bear) | [[Grey Wardens]], Northlands |
| Warchief Mogra | Berserker | [[House Thorne]], Grahzak Guard |
| Thundra Peak-Born | World Tree | Storm Walkers, Greycrowns |
| Ylva the Red | Zealot | [[The Faith of the Three]] |
