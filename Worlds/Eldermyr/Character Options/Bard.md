# Bard

> [!info] Class Summary
> Bards weave magic through music, oration, and performance. In Eldermyr, they serve as court entertainers, traveling storytellers, spies, and keepers of history. Their magic comes from the power of words and sound—the same power the [[Faith of the Three]] claims created the world.

## Overview

Bards are versatile spellcasters who inspire allies, manipulate enemies, and possess unmatched breadth of knowledge. They learn fragments of magic from many sources, can talk their way into or out of almost anything, and serve as the party's face in social situations. More than entertainers, bards are lore-keepers, diplomats, and subtle manipulators of fate.

## Bards in Eldermyr

### Cultural Traditions

**The Skalds of the Northlands**
In the [[Northlands]], skalds are sacred figures who preserve the histories of clans and heroes. They follow the Old Ways and believe that words have literal power—a well-crafted poem can bless or curse. Skalds memorize thousands of verses and can recite lineages going back twenty generations. When a Northlands warrior dies, their skald composes their death-song, ensuring their deeds echo forever.

**Court Minstrels**
The noble courts of [[Aldersgate]], [[Porto Valdris]], and [[Stahlburg]] all maintain bards as entertainers, historians, and subtle advisors. Court bards are expected to compose songs celebrating their patron while quietly gathering information on rivals. The most skilled move between houses, collecting secrets and trading favors.

**The Songweaver Tradition**
The [[Arcane Academy]] teaches that bardic magic is a lesser but fascinating form of arcane manipulation. "Songweavers" study there to refine their talents, learning to blend music theory with magical principles. [[Archmagister Corwin Ashford]] himself began as a bard before transitioning to pure wizardry.

**Western Shore Chanteyers**
Sailors of the [[Western Shore]] have their own bardic tradition—work songs that genuinely help with labor, sea shanties that calm storms, and ballads that guide ships through fog. [[Captain Alonzo the Bold]] is said to employ a bard whose songs can summon favorable winds.

### Training Paths

**The Wanderer's Way**
Many bards learn by traveling, absorbing stories, songs, and magic from every culture they encounter. A bard might spend a year with Northlands skalds, another at the Arcane Academy, and a third among Western Shore sailors.

**Noble Patronage**
Wealthy families sponsor promising musicians, providing formal training in exchange for years of service. These bards receive education in etiquette, history, and magic alongside performance.

**The Old Tongues**
Some bards seek out ancient languages—the original tongue of the Three, the secret speech of druids, or the Black Tongue that [[The Unnamed]] supposedly whispered. Learning these grants power but carries risks.

### Role in the Current Crisis

Bards are invaluable during the succession conflict:

- **Propaganda artists** shape public opinion about claimants
- **Spies** move freely between courts as "mere entertainers"
- **Historians** research [[The Unnamed]] and how it was defeated before
- **Diplomats** negotiate between hostile factions
- **Chroniclers** record events for posterity

[[House Valdren]] employs the most bards, using them to maintain trade relationships and gather intelligence. [[House Thorne]] distrusts bardic "tricks" but employs a few trusted skalds. [[House Karath]] once had a strong bardic tradition, now corrupted into something darker.

### Social Standing

Bards enjoy unusual social mobility:

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Noble Courts | Respected servants, potential confidants |
| Common Folk | Beloved entertainers, news-bringers |
| The Church | Mixed—Word of the Three is sacred, but secular songs are suspect |
| Academics | Regarded as dilettantes with useful abilities |
| Military | Valued for morale and communication |

## Organizations

### The Lorekeeper's Circle
An informal network of bards dedicated to preserving history and uncovering lost knowledge. They maintain secret archives throughout Eldermyr and share information freely among members. During the current crisis, they've been researching [[The Unnamed]] and the original war.

### The Silver Tongues
A shadowy guild of bards who specialize in espionage and manipulation. Based in [[Porto Valdris]], they sell information and services to the highest bidder. Some whisper they serve a secret patron whose identity even members don't know.

### The College of [[Aldersgate]]
The formal bardic institution in the capital, training court entertainers and official historians. Currently struggling with divided loyalties as students and masters support different claimants.

### The Skald-Moot
The gathering of Northlands skalds, held three times yearly at [[Vindrheim]]. They share stories, settle disputes through song-contests, and preserve oral traditions. The Skald-Moot has declared neutrality in the succession but watches events closely.
