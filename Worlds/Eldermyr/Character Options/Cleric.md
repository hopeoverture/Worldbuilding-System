# Cleric

> [!info] Class Summary
> Clerics channel divine power through faith. In Eldermyr, they serve [[The Faith of the Three]]—the Shepherd (life), the Judge (death/justice), and the Architect (creation/knowledge). Each aspect grants different abilities, and the Church wields enormous political and spiritual power.

## Overview

Clerics are divine spellcasters who derive power from their faith. Unlike wizards who study magic or sorcerers who are born with it, clerics are granted power by a divine source in exchange for devotion and service. They are the primary healers in most parties but can fill many roles depending on their domain.

## Clerics in Eldermyr

### The Faith of the Three

All clerics in Eldermyr draw power from [[The Faith of the Three]], the dominant religion:

**The Shepherd** (Life Domain)
- Aspect of protection, healing, and guidance
- Clerics tend flocks, heal the sick, and guide souls
- Symbol: The Crook
- Primary temple: [[Thornhall]]

**The Judge** (Light, War, Trickery Domains)
- Aspect of justice, truth, and righteous punishment
- Three faces: The Radiant Judge (Light), the War-Bringer (War), the Hidden Judge (Trickery)
- Clerics serve as confessors, inquisitors, and executioners
- Symbol: The Scales
- Primary temple: [[Aldersgate]] Cathedral

**The Architect** (Knowledge variant, not in 2024 PHB)
- Aspect of creation, knowledge, and civilization
- Clerics build, teach, and preserve
- Symbol: The Compass
- Primary temple: The Foundation in [[Aldersgate]]

### Church Hierarchy

| Rank | Role |
|------|------|
| [[High Confessor Maren]] | Supreme leader of the Faith |
| Cardinal | Rules a region's faith |
| Bishop | Oversees a city's temples |
| Priest/Priestess | Leads a congregation |
| Acolyte | Clergy in training |

### Training Paths

**The Seminary Path**
Most clerics train at church-run seminaries, studying theology, liturgy, and divine magic. [[Thornhall]] houses the greatest seminary, where acolytes spend years in study before ordination.

**Divine Calling**
Some receive power directly—a vision, a near-death experience, or a moment of perfect faith. These "called" clerics are viewed with both awe and suspicion. The Church prefers trained clergy but cannot deny divine intervention.

**The Heresy Trials**
Clerics who stray from doctrine face investigation by the Inquisition. During the current crisis, [[High Confessor Maren]] has expanded the trials, ostensibly seeking those corrupted by [[The Unnamed]].

### Role in the Current Crisis

The Church stands at a crossroads:

- **The succession question**: The Faith traditionally crowns the High King, giving them enormous power in the current dispute
- **The Unnamed**: The risen dead challenge the Church's authority over death and the afterlife
- **Internal corruption**: Some believe [[High Confessor Maren]] may be compromised
- **Turn Undead**: Clerics are desperately needed to combat the risen dead

The [[Grey Wardens]] actively recruit clerics for their undead-hunting mission. Every patrol includes at least one priest capable of turning the dead.

### Social Standing

Clerics command respect throughout Eldermyr:

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Common Folk | Trusted healers, spiritual guides |
| Nobility | Political allies or rivals |
| [[Grey Wardens]] | Essential partners |
| The Arcane Academy | Respectful distance, theological disputes |
| Border Regions | Missionaries, sometimes resented |

## Organizations

### The Synod of [[Thornhall]]
The governing body of the Faith, comprising all Bishops and Cardinals. They advise the High Confessor and elect their successor. Currently deadlocked over succession.

### The Hospitallers
Life Domain clerics organized into a healing order. They operate infirmaries throughout Eldermyr and accompany armies as medics. Strictly neutral in political conflicts.

### The Inquisition
War and Light Domain clerics who investigate heresy and corruption. Led by Confessor Aldric Stern, they've become increasingly aggressive during the crisis.

### The Watchers
Trickery Domain clerics who serve as the Church's intelligence network. Officially they don't exist. In practice, they know everything.

### The Builders' Guild
Architect-focused clerics who design and construct temples, fortifications, and public works. They maintain the great cathedrals and have preserved construction techniques from before [[The Great War]].

## Notable Clerics

| Name | Domain | Affiliation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [[High Confessor Maren]] | Life (corrupted?) | Supreme leader |
| Confessor Aldric Stern | War | Inquisition leader |
| Mother Helena | Life | Hospitallers, [[Grey Wardens]] ally |
| Brother Silas | Trickery | The Watchers, [[Aldersgate]] |
| Father Gregorius | Light | [[Thornhall]] Seminary Dean |

## Playing a Cleric in Eldermyr

### Character Concepts
- A Life cleric questioning the Church's political involvement
- A War cleric who served in the heresy trials and regrets it
- A Light cleric hunting [[The Unnamed]]'s corruption in the Church
- A Trickery cleric spy torn between faith and orders
- A village priest whose congregation was killed by the risen dead

### Connections to the Crisis
- The risen dead mock the Church's authority over death
- [[High Confessor Maren]] may be serving [[The Unnamed]]
- The faithful look to clerics for answers that may not exist
- Ancient prayers from before [[The Great War]] may hold power against the ancient evil

### Domain Integration

| Life | The Shepherd's servants, Hospitallers |
| Light | The Judge's purifiers, truth-seekers |
| Trickery | Hidden Judge's agents, the Watchers |
| War | Righteous warriors, Inquisition |

### The Aasimar Question
[[Aasimar]] births are considered divine blessings—children touched by the Three. The Church claims authority over all aasimar, often taking them for training. Since [[The Unnamed]] began stirring, aasimar births have mysteriously declined.
