# Druid

> [!info] Class Summary
> Druids draw power from the natural world and the [[The Old Ways|Old Ways]]—ancient traditions that predate [[The Faith of the Three]]. They are shapeshifters, storm-callers, and guardians of wild places. In Eldermyr, they face persecution from the Church but remain vital to the land's balance.

## Overview

Druids are primal spellcasters who channel the power of nature itself. They can transform into animals, command the elements, and commune with the natural world. Unlike clerics who serve gods, druids serve the land—and the land has its own will.

## Druids in Eldermyr

### The Old Ways

Druidism represents the [[The Old Ways|Old Ways]]—spiritual practices that predate the [[Faith of the Three]] by millennia. While the Church claims the Three created nature, druids know the land existed before any gods took notice.

**Core Beliefs:**
- The land is alive and has its own will
- Balance must be maintained between civilization and wilderness
- The dead should return to the earth, not walk again
- Some places are sacred and must be protected

### Regional Traditions

**The Myrkvid Circle**
[[Myrkvid]], the Dark Wood, hosts Eldermyr's most powerful druid circle. They guard ancient secrets, including knowledge of [[The Unnamed]] from before the Faith existed. The Myrkvid druids are hostile to outsiders but may help those fighting the risen dead.

**The Greencloaks**
Druids of the [[King's Wood]] who serve as informal rangers for the [[Crown Lands]]. They tolerate the monarchy as "acceptable stewardship" and have helped protect the realm for generations. Currently torn between their duties and suspicion of [[House Valdren]].

**The Sea Shepherds**
Coastal druids of the [[Western Shore]] who calm storms, guide ships, and maintain the fishing grounds. They work alongside the fishing villages and have an uneasy truce with [[Porto Valdris]] merchants.

**The Stone Speakers**
Mountain druids of the [[Greycrowns]] and [[Ostmark Range]] who commune with the living rock. They know paths through the mountains that appear on no map and maintain ancient wards against something in the deep places.

**The Ash Wardens**
A new circle formed specifically to combat [[The Unnamed]]. Based near [[The Ashen Fields]], they work to heal the corrupted land and contain the spread of undeath.

### Training Paths

**The Seven-Year Walk**
Traditional druid training requires seven years of wandering, learning from the land itself. Initiates travel between sacred groves, learning from elder druids at each. The final test is a year alone in the wilderness.

**Circle Apprenticeship**
Some circles take apprentices directly, training them in that circle's specific traditions. Myrkvid druids rarely accept outsiders; Greencloaks actively recruit promising youths.

**Spontaneous Awakening**
The land sometimes chooses its champions directly. A farmer might suddenly hear the wheat speaking, or a child lost in the forest might be returned by wolves who've taught them Wild Shape.

### Relationship with the Church

The [[Faith of the Three]] officially condemns druidism as "nature worship" and "spiritual confusion." In practice, the relationship is complex:

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [[The Crown Lands]] | Tolerated if discreet |
| [[The Northlands]] | Openly practiced alongside Old Ways |
| [[The Eastern March]] | Quietly accepted, especially by [[House Thorne]] |
| [[The Western Shore]] | Sea Shepherds grudgingly respected |
| [[The Karath Reach]] | Druids driven out generations ago |

The current crisis has forced cooperation. The Church cannot deny that druidic magic effectively combats the risen dead, even if they won't admit why.

### Role in the Current Crisis

Druids are vital to fighting [[The Unnamed]]:

- **Land healing**: Only druids can cleanse corrupted ground
- **Ancient knowledge**: The Myrkvid Circle knows things about [[The Unnamed]] that predate Church records
- **Natural allies**: Animals and plants can sense undead, serving as early warning systems
- **Wild Shape**: Effective scouts in dangerous territory
- **Balance restoration**: The risen dead represent a fundamental violation of natural order

## Organizations

### The Grove Council
Representatives from all major circles who meet at the equinoxes and solstices. They've set aside traditional rivalries to coordinate against [[The Unnamed]].

### The Myrkvid Circle
The oldest and most secretive circle, led by Archdruid Thornweald. They guard pre-Faith knowledge and ancient wards that may be needed against [[The Unnamed]].

### The Greencloaks
Crown Lands druids who maintain the King's Wood and serve as informal royal advisors on natural matters. Led by Elder Iona Greenmantle.

### The Ash Wardens
A coalition circle formed after the risen dead appeared. They maintain camps near [[The Ashen Fields]], working to contain the corruption.

## Notable Druids

| Archdruid Thornweald | Myrkvid (Moon) | Ancient keeper, knows pre-Faith secrets |

| Wave-Speaker Maren | Sea Shepherds (Sea) | Coastal protector, storm-caller |
| Ashseeker Kira | Ash Wardens (Stars) | Corruption fighter, rising leader |
