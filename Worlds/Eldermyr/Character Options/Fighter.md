> [!info] Class Summary
> Fighters are supreme warriors trained in all forms of combat. In Eldermyr, they form the backbone of every army—from noble knights of the great houses to hardened soldiers of the [[Grey Wardens]]. Their discipline and versatility make them invaluable in every conflict.

## Overview

Fighters are masters of martial combat. They gain more attacks than any other class, can use any weapon or armor effectively, and develop specialized techniques that make them deadly in battle. While other classes may have flashier abilities, fighters win wars through skill, discipline, and endurance.

## Fighters in Eldermyr

### Military Traditions

**The Knightly Orders**
Eldermyr's nobility centers on mounted combat and codes of honor. Each great house maintains knights who serve as elite cavalry, personal guards, and champions. Knighthood requires years of training as a page, then squire, before earning spurs.

| House | Knightly Order | Specialty |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| [[House Valdren]] | Silver Sails | Naval combat, coastal defense |
| [[House Thorne]] | Iron Guard | Heavy cavalry, mountain warfare |
| [[House Karath]] | Ashen Knights (destroyed) | Once famous, now risen as enemies |

**The Standing Armies**
Below knights, professional soldiers form the backbone of each house's military. These fighters train in pike formations, crossbow volleys, and siege warfare. The [[Crown Lands]] maintains the largest standing army, currently split between loyalist factions.

**The Grey Wardens**
[[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]] commands the realm's premier undead-hunting force. Grey Warden fighters combine standard martial training with specialized techniques for fighting the risen—striking decayed joints, avoiding infectious bites, and maintaining formation against tireless enemies.

**The Mercenary Companies**
The succession crisis has spawned numerous mercenary bands. The most famous include:
- **The Bronze Shields**: Veterans of the eastern border wars
- **The Crimson Company**: Former soldiers from all houses
- **Thorne's Wolves**: Orc and human fighters loyal to whoever pays

### Training Paths

**The Squire's Way**
Noble fighters train from childhood. Pages learn courtesy and horsemanship; squires assist knights in combat; proven squires are knighted by their lord. This produces disciplined, well-equipped fighters bound by oaths of loyalty.

**The Soldier's Trade**
Common fighters learn in the ranks. Drill sergeants teach formation fighting, weapon maintenance, and survival. Promising soldiers may advance to sergeant, then captain. Some earn recognition and minor noble status.

**The Academy Method**
[[Stahlburg]] hosts a military academy where [[House Thorne]] trains officers. The curriculum emphasizes tactics, logistics, and battlefield command. Many Battle Master fighters study here.

**The Warden's Trial**
Joining the [[Grey Wardens]] requires surviving their training—a brutal combination of standard combat drills and practical undead-fighting experience. Many candidates fail. Those who pass become among Eldermyr's most respected warriors.

### Role in the Current Crisis

Fighters are central to every aspect of the succession war:

- **House armies** clash over territory and succession
- **Grey Wardens** desperately need reinforcements against the risen
- **Mercenaries** profit from the chaos while choosing sides
- **Knights** struggle with conflicting oaths and loyalties
- **Veteran soldiers** watch their comrades rise as enemies

The risen dead have changed warfare in Eldermyr. Casualties join the enemy. Traditional tactics fail against foes that feel no pain or fear. Fighters must adapt or die.

### Social Standing

Fighters enjoy the highest martial status:

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Nobility | Knights are respected peers |
| Military | Command structure and authority |
| Common Folk | Protectors or oppressors, depending |
| The Church | Holy knights honored, mercenaries suspect |
| [[Grey Wardens]] | Elite status, special privileges |

## Organizations

### The Grey Wardens
Eldermyr's undead-hunting military order. [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]] leads from [[The Warden's March]], the patrol route around [[The Ashen Fields]]. Grey Warden fighters represent the best of the realm's warriors.

### The Royal Guard
Elite fighters sworn to protect the throne. Currently in crisis—who do they serve when the throne is empty? Some support the Regent ([[Lord Darius Valdren]]), others remain at the palace awaiting a legitimate ruler.

### The Iron Guard of Thorne
[[House Thorne]]'s heavy cavalry, the realm's most feared mounted force. Their steel-clad charges have broken every enemy they've faced. [[Ser Aldric Thorne]] commands them.

### The Mercenary Guilds
Loose associations that provide contracts, arbitration, and standards for sellswords. The Goldport Guild and Porto Valdris Company are the largest.

## Notable Fighters

|------|-----------|-------------|
| [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]] | Champion | [[Grey Wardens]] |
