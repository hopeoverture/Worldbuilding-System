# Monk

> [!info] Class Summary
> Monks channel ki—inner spiritual energy—into supernatural martial arts. In Eldermyr, they are rare practitioners who train in isolated monasteries, serving various purposes from contemplation to assassination. The [[Faith of the Three]] views them with suspicion, but their abilities cannot be denied.

## Overview

Monks are martial artists who channel inner energy called ki to perform supernatural feats. They strike with devastating speed, move with preternatural grace, and eventually achieve mastery over body and mind that transcends normal limits. Monks require no weapons or armor, making them uniquely independent.

## Monks in Eldermyr

### The Contemplative Orders

Monasticism exists at the edges of Eldermyr society—not forbidden, but not truly understood.

**The Order of the Threefold Path**
The only monastic tradition sanctioned by [[The Faith of the Three]]. Based at the remote Monastery of Ascension in the [[Greycrowns]], they interpret ki as a form of divine grace. Threefold Path monks pursue spiritual purity through physical discipline, believing the body is a temple to be perfected.

**The Mountain Watchers**
[[Goliaths]] of the high peaks have their own martial tradition, ancient beyond memory. They call their ki *gorath*—mountain-breath—and believe they channel the strength of the stone itself. Mountain Watcher monks serve as guardians, judges, and protectors of sacred sites.

**The Shadow House**
A secretive order based somewhere in the [[Western Shore]], possibly [[Port Corsair]]. They train assassins, spies, and bodyguards whose ki manipulation allows them to become one with darkness. The Shadow House sells its services to anyone who can pay—and keep secrets.

**The Jade Fist**
Remnants of an eastern tradition that arrived via [[Western Shore]] trade routes generations ago. They maintain a small temple in [[Porto Valdris]] and teach Way of the Open Hand techniques to those deemed worthy. Their exotic fighting style is both admired and feared.

**The Ash Monks**
A new order formed after the rise of [[The Unnamed]]. Based near [[The Ashen Fields]], they combine contemplative discipline with undead-fighting techniques. Way of Mercy monks learn to feel the corruption in the risen dead and purify it with a touch.

### Training Paths

**The Seven Steps**
Traditional monastery training follows seven stages, each lasting years: Awakening, Foundation, Discipline, Flow, Mastery, Transcendence, and Perfection. Few complete all seven.

**The Hard Road**
Some discover ki without formal training—through trauma, near-death experiences, or extreme circumstances. These "wild monks" often struggle to control their abilities but may achieve unconventional mastery.

**The Shadow Contract**
The Shadow House trains disciples from childhood, taken (or bought) from families. Training is brutal and mortality is high. Survivors become formidable operatives.

### Relationship with Society

Monks exist outside normal social structures:

| Institution | Relationship |
|-------------|--------------|
| [[The Faith of the Three]] | Tolerates Threefold Path; suspicious of others |
| Nobility | Exotic curiosity; occasional bodyguards |
| Military | Respected but not integrated |
| Common Folk | Mysterious, sometimes feared |
| [[Arcane Academy]] | Academically curious about ki |

The current crisis has increased interest in monks. Their abilities to fight without weapons, sense corruption, and survive impossible odds make them valuable allies.

### Role in the Current Crisis

Monks serve specialized roles in the succession conflict:

- **Threefold Path monks** heal the wounded and fight the risen with divine-blessed strikes
- **Shadow House operatives** sell their services to all factions
- **Mountain Watchers** guard the high passes against undead incursion
- **Ash Monks** directly combat [[The Unnamed]]'s corruption
- **Individual monks** seek their own paths through the chaos

The risen dead present unique challenges—they feel no pain, so pressure points fail. Monks have developed new techniques targeting joints and decapitation.

## Organizations

### The Monastery of Ascension
The Threefold Path headquarters, high in the [[Greycrowns]]. Abbot Cornelius leads several hundred monks in contemplation and training.

### The Shadow House
Identity hidden, location secret. They train Way of Shadow monks and sell their services throughout Eldermyr. Contact is made through intermediaries in [[Port Corsair]] and [[Porto Valdris]].

### The Mountain Watchers
Not truly an organization—more a shared tradition among [[Goliaths]]. They recognize each other and cooperate when needed but maintain no formal structure.

### The Temple of the Jade Fist
A small monastery in [[Porto Valdris]] teaching Open Hand techniques. Master Chen leads perhaps thirty students of various species.

### The Ash Monastery
Founded five years ago near [[The Ashen Fields]]. Abbot Kira (formerly Ashseeker Kira of the Ash Wardens) combines druidic wisdom with monastic discipline.

## Notable Monks

| The Silent One | Shadow | Shadow House, identity unknown |
