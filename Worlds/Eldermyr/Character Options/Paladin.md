# Paladin

> [!info] Class Summary
> Paladins are holy warriors who swear sacred oaths that grant divine power. In Eldermyr, they serve [[The Faith of the Three]] as templars, champions, and divine enforcers. Their ability to smite evil and heal allies makes them invaluable against the risen dead.

## Overview

Paladins combine martial prowess with divine magic, powered not by worship of gods but by the strength of their oaths. A paladin who upholds their sacred vow channels divine energy into devastating smites, protective auras, and healing touch. Breaking their oath costs them their power.

## Paladins in Eldermyr

### The Sacred Oaths

In Eldermyr, paladin oaths are bound to aspects of [[The Faith of the Three]]:

**Oath of Devotion — The Shepherd's Shield**
The most common paladin oath, sworn to protect the innocent and uphold virtue. Devotion paladins serve as templars of the Shepherd aspect, guarding temples, escorting pilgrims, and defending the helpless. Their oath: *"I shall shield the flock from all wolves."*

**Oath of Vengeance — The Judge's Blade**
Sworn to punish the wicked without mercy. Vengeance paladins serve the Judge aspect, hunting heretics, criminals, and—increasingly—the servants of [[The Unnamed]]. Their oath: *"No evil shall escape justice."*

**Oath of Glory — The Champion's Creed**
Dedicated to heroic deeds that inspire others. Glory paladins believe their achievements honor the Architect by demonstrating mortal potential. Their oath: *"My victories shall light the way."*

**Oath of the Ancients — The Green Knight**
A rare oath that predates the Faith, sworn to protect the world itself. Ancients paladins bridge the [[Old Ways]] and the Faith, serving nature as much as any deity. The Church tolerates them reluctantly. Their oath: *"I stand where light meets shadow."*

### Training Paths

**The Templar's Trial**
Church-trained paladins undergo years of martial and theological education at [[Thornhall]]. The final test is the Vigil of Three—three days and nights of fasting, prayer, and contemplation before swearing their oath. Those who emerge receive their oath's blessing directly.

**The Battlefield Oath**
Some paladins swear their oaths in moments of crisis—a soldier who vows vengeance over their murdered family, a knight who pledges protection as enemies surround them. These "battlefield paladins" often struggle with formal Church hierarchy but possess undeniable divine power.

**The Green Investiture**
Ancients paladins are made, not trained. They undergo rituals in sacred groves, swearing oaths to the land itself. Druids and priests often disagree about the source of their power.

### The Templar Orders

| Order | Oath | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Order of the Silver Shield | Devotion | Temple guards, pilgrimage escorts |
| Order of the Burning Blade | Vengeance | Inquisition enforcers, heretic hunters |
| Order of the Golden Lion | Glory | Tournament champions, diplomatic escorts |
| Fellowship of the Green | Ancients | Nature protectors, Church-tolerated |

### Role in the Current Crisis

Paladins are desperately needed against [[The Unnamed]]:

- **Divine Smite** deals extra damage to undead, making paladins invaluable
- **Aura of Protection** keeps entire squads fighting
- **Lay on Hands** provides battlefield healing
- **Aura of Courage** prevents panic against horrifying undead

However, the succession crisis divides paladin loyalties:

- **Devotion paladins** struggle with which claimant to protect
- **Vengeance paladins** focus on [[The Unnamed]] as the true enemy
- **Glory paladins** seek heroic deeds regardless of politics
- **Ancients paladins** sense the land's corruption and prioritize healing it

Some paladins have begun to question [[High Confessor Maren]]'s orders, sensing corruption at the Faith's highest levels.

### Social Standing

Paladins command enormous respect:

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Church | Elite warriors, voice of the Three |
| Nobility | Honored knights, potential rivals |
| Military | Officers, morale anchors |
| Common Folk | Living saints, miracle workers |
| [[Grey Wardens]] | Natural allies, joint operations |

## Organizations

### The Order of the Silver Shield
Largest templar order, devoted to Devotion oaths. Grand Master Helena Brightward commands from [[Thornhall]], struggling to maintain neutrality in the succession.

### The Order of the Burning Blade
Vengeance paladins who serve the Inquisition. Lord Commander Tomas Ashford leads the hunt for heretics and [[The Unnamed]]'s servants.

### The Order of the Golden Lion
Glory paladins who serve as diplomatic champions and tournament knights. Lady Champion Isolde Valdren (yes, a Valdren) struggles with family versus oath loyalties.

### The Fellowship of the Green
Loose organization of Ancients paladins, meeting at sacred groves rather than temples. Elder Knight Thornwood, a half-elf, serves as informal leader.

### The Grey Templar
A special unit of paladins permanently attached to the [[Grey Wardens]]. They've developed specialized techniques for smiting undead efficiently.

## Notable Paladins

| Name | Oath | Affiliation |
|------|------|-------------|
| Grand Master Helena Brightward | Devotion | Order of the Silver Shield |
| Lord Commander Tomas Ashford | Vengeance | Burning Blade, Inquisition |
| Lady Isolde Valdren | Glory | Golden Lion, torn loyalties |
| Elder Knight Thornwood | Ancients | Fellowship of the Green |
| Sir Marcus Greymane | Vengeance | Grey Templar, undead hunter |

## Playing a Paladin in Eldermyr

|------|---------------------|
| Devotion | Silver Shield templars, Shepherd's servants |
| Vengeance | Burning Blade, Inquisition enforcers |
| Glory | Golden Lion champions, heroic tradition |
| Ancients | Fellowship of the Green, Old Ways bridge |

### Oathbreakers
Paladins who fall become oathbreakers—stripped of divine power unless they find darker patrons. [[The Unnamed]] has been corrupting fallen paladins, creating anti-paladins who wield necrotic smites against their former allies.
