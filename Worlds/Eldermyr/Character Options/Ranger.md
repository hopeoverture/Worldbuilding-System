## Rangers in Eldermyr

### Ranger Traditions

**The Grey Wardens**
The [[Grey Wardens]] represent Eldermyr's premier ranger organization—though they include fighters, clerics, and others, ranger traditions form their core. Grey Warden rangers specialize in hunting the risen dead, learning to track creatures that leave no warmth and feel no hunger.

**The King's Rangers**
Royal wardens who patrol the [[Crown Lands]], protecting travelers and maintaining order in the [[King's Wood]]. They answer to the throne—whoever sits on it—creating current tensions between rangers loyal to different claimants.

**The Border Scouts**
[[House Thorne]] maintains ranger units along the eastern frontier. These hardy souls watch [[Ostmark Pass]] and the mountain borders, often the first to encounter threats from beyond. Many are [[Orcs]] or work closely with orc warriors.

**The Sea Watchers**
Coastal rangers of the [[Western Shore]] who patrol for pirates, smugglers, and threats from the sea. They work closely with [[House Valdren]] and the merchant fleets.

**The Myrkvid Hunters**
Wild rangers of the [[Northlands]] who venture into [[Myrkvid]] where others fear to tread. They know the Dark Wood's secrets better than any and guard against what lurks within.

### Training Paths

**The Warden's Trial**
[[Grey Wardens]] put ranger recruits through grueling trials—tracking through hostile terrain, surviving alone in the wilds, and ultimately hunting undead under veteran supervision. The mortality rate is high, but survivors become legends.

**The Apprentice Way**
Traditional ranger training involves years shadowing an experienced warden. Apprentices learn tracking, herbalism, survival, and combat through practical experience rather than formal instruction.

**The Wild Awakening**
Some rangers discover their abilities through crisis—lost in the wilderness, they find primal magic awakening within them. Beast Master rangers often bond with their companions during such experiences.

**The Fey Touch**
Fey Wanderer rangers are made, not born—usually through an encounter with fey creatures in [[Myrkvid]] or similar wild places. They return changed, marked by the otherworld.

### Role in the Current Crisis

Rangers are essential to fighting [[The Unnamed]]:

- **Tracking undead** requires specialized skills—the risen don't leave normal signs
- **Scouting corrupted territory** demands ranger stealth and survival
- **Hunter's Mark** works on undead, making ranger damage reliable
- **Animal companions** can sense undead presence before humans can
- **Gloom Stalkers** excel at night operations when the dead are most active

The [[Grey Wardens]] have increased ranger recruitment dramatically. [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]] personally oversees training programs designed to produce undead-hunting specialists.

### Social Standing

Rangers occupy a unique niche:

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Rural Communities | Respected protectors |
| Cities | Rugged outsiders, occasionally useful |
| Military | Valued scouts and irregulars |
| [[Grey Wardens]] | Core identity of the order |
| Nobility | Useful servants, sometimes independent |

## Organizations

### The Grey Wardens
Eldermyr's undead-hunting order recruits heavily from ranger traditions. Rangers form the backbone of Warden patrols, serving as scouts, trackers, and specialized hunters.

### The King's Rangers
Crown Lands wardens, currently split between loyalist factions. Captain Roderick of Greenhollow tries to maintain neutrality, but pressure mounts.

### The Thornwood Scouts
[[House Thorne]]'s border rangers, led by Scout-Captain Kira Ironwood. They've been on high alert since the risen dead began appearing.

### The Myrkvid Brotherhood
Informal association of rangers who dare to enter the Dark Wood. Elder Hunter Fenris leads through respect rather than authority.

### The Sea Watch
Coastal ranger organization serving [[House Valdren]] and the [[Western Shore]] merchants.
