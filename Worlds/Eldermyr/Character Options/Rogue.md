## Rogues in Eldermyr

### Criminal Underworlds

Every major city in Eldermyr has its shadow economy:

**The Aldersgate Shadows**
The capital's thieves' guild operates beneath the city in ancient tunnels. They control pickpocketing, burglary, and fencing throughout the [[Crown Lands]]. Currently paralyzed by succession uncertainty—which claimant will they support?

**The Corsair Brotherhood**
[[Port Corsair]] exists as a de facto rogue haven. Pirates, smugglers, and thieves operate openly, protected by the city's independent status. The Brotherhood provides contracts, dispute resolution, and training.

**The Valdris Network**
[[House Valdren]] maintains a sophisticated spy network disguised as a trading company. These "merchants" gather intelligence across Eldermyr, reporting to the Valdren spymaster in [[Porto Valdris]].

**The Karath Whispers**
[[House Karath]]'s former spy network, now fragmented. Some serve [[Yelena Karath]] willingly, others were forced to continue through blackmail, and some have gone independent or defected.

### Professional Guilds

Not all rogues are criminals:

**The Locksmiths' Guild**
Legal specialists in locks, traps, and security. They design protection for the wealthy and—for the right price—assess weaknesses in others' security.

**The Information Brokers**
A loose network trading in secrets. Based in [[Porto Valdris]], they sell intelligence to anyone without political preference.

**The Shadow House Operatives**
The [[Monk]] assassin order employs rogues as support—scouts, infiltrators, and escape specialists who lack ki abilities but excel at mundane skills.

### Training Paths

**The Street Education**
Most rogues learn on the streets—picking pockets, running cons, and gradually developing more sophisticated skills. Survival teaches what mentors cannot.

**Guild Apprenticeship**
Established thieves' guilds train apprentices formally, teaching lockpicking, stealth, combat, and guild codes. Apprenticeship typically lasts three to five years.

**The Noble's Game**
Noble houses train their own intelligence operatives. These rogues learn etiquette alongside assassination, moving through high society while gathering secrets.

**The Arcane Path**
Arcane Tricksters combine [[Arcane Academy]] study with roguish skills. Most are self-taught mages who apply magic to criminal ends, but a few legitimate academy students take darker paths.

### Role in the Current Crisis

The succession war has made rogues invaluable:

- **Assassins** are in high demand from all factions
- **Spies** gather intelligence on rival houses
- **Thieves** steal documents, artifacts, and secrets
- **Scouts** infiltrate enemy positions
- **Information brokers** profit from chaos

Against [[The Unnamed]], rogues serve specialized roles:
- Scouting corrupted territory
- Stealing artifacts that might help defeat the ancient evil
- Eliminating [[House Karath]] agents serving the darkness
- Finding safe routes through dangerous areas

### Social Standing

Rogues occupy the margins:

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Criminal World | Respected for skills |
| Law Enforcement | Wanted criminals |
| Nobility | Useful but deniable |
| Military | Valuable scouts and saboteurs |
| Common Folk | Feared or romanticized |

## Organizations

### The Aldersgate Shadows
The capital's thieves' guild, led by the mysterious "Grandmother." They control crime in the Crown Lands through a combination of expertise, violence, and political connections.

### The Corsair Brotherhood
[[Port Corsair]]'s governing body—part guild, part government. Captain-Admiral Rosa Blacktide leads this organization of pirates, smugglers, and rogues.

### The Valdris Network
[[House Valdren]]'s intelligence service, disguised as the Golden Coin Trading Company. Master of Whispers (title, not name) coordinates operations.

### The Silent Coin
Assassin contractors operating out of [[Goldport]]. They accept contracts from anyone who can pay, maintaining strict neutrality in politics.

### The Locksmith's Guild
Professional security specialists with chapters in every major city. Guildmaster Theodric maintains strict ethics—they don't break locks, they ensure others can't.
