# Sorcerer

> [!info] Class Summary
> Sorcerers wield innate magical power—born with it rather than learning it. In Eldermyr, they are called "Spark-Born" or "Blood Mages," viewed with both awe and fear. The [[Arcane Academy]] studies them, the [[Faith of the Three]] watches them, and common folk whisper about them.

## Overview

Sorcerers possess magic in their blood, their souls, their very being. Unlike wizards who study or warlocks who bargain, sorcerers simply *are* magical. Their power manifests through Sorcery Points and Metamagic—the ability to twist and enhance spells in ways other casters cannot imagine.

## Core Mechanics

## Sorcerers in Eldermyr

### The Spark-Born Phenomenon

Sorcerous ability manifests seemingly at random, though certain bloodlines show higher incidence. Common folk call them "Spark-Born"—touched by magical fire in the womb. The [[Arcane Academy]] prefers "natural conduits," while the [[Faith of the Three]] whispers "marked souls."

### Sorcerous Origins in Eldermyr

**Draconic Bloodline**
The most accepted origin. Ancient pacts between dragons and mortal bloodlines created magical lineages that persist today. [[House Valdren]] claims draconic ancestry, and draconic sorcerers are common on the [[Western Shore]] near [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]].

**Wild Magic**
Feared throughout the realm. Wild Magic sorcerers are walking disasters—brilliant but unpredictable. Many trace their origin to [[Myrkvid]], where fey influence corrupts magical bloodlines. The Church considers them spiritually dangerous.

**Clockwork Soul**
Rare sorcerers touched by cosmic order. They appeared only recently, leading scholars to wonder what planar influence causes this origin. Some theorize connection to ancient divine machines.

**Aberrant Mind**
The most terrifying origin. Aberrant sorcerers possess psychic powers suggesting influence from entities beyond normal reality. The Inquisition watches them closely, and some whisper that [[The Unnamed]] creates such sorcerers.

### Social Standing

Sorcerers occupy a precarious position:

| Institution | View |
|-------------|------|
| [[Arcane Academy]] | Fascinating subjects, potential students |
| [[Faith of the Three]] | Dangerous, requiring oversight |
| Nobility | Valuable if controllable |
| Common Folk | Feared, sometimes worshipped |
| Military | Powerful assets, difficult to trust |

The Church insists sorcerers register with local temples and submit to periodic "spiritual assessment." In practice, many hide their abilities.

### Training and Control

**Academy Enrollment**
The [[Arcane Academy]] actively recruits sorcerers, offering training in exchange for study. Sorcerers learn to channel their power safely while academics observe their abilities. Many graduate as controlled, respected mages.

**Church Oversight**
The [[Faith of the Three]] requires sorcerers to register and maintains "guidance counselors" who monitor registered sorcerers. This ranges from supportive mentorship to barely-disguised surveillance.

**Wild Development**
Many sorcerers never receive formal training, developing control through trial and error. These "wild sorcerers" are both dangerous and powerful, unconstrained by academy caution.

**The Burned Ones**
Sorcerers whose powers emerged destructively—burning their homes, killing loved ones, destroying towns. Survivors carry tremendous guilt and often seek redemption or isolation.

### Role in the Current Crisis

Sorcerers are invaluable in the current conflict:

- **Raw power** exceeds most trained wizards
- **Metamagic** allows unprecedented spell flexibility
- **Quickened Spells** provide burst damage against undead hordes
- **Subtle Spells** enable covert operations
- **Wild Magic** could be either savior or disaster

However, fears persist:

- Could [[The Unnamed]] corrupt sorcerous bloodlines?
- Are Aberrant sorcerers already agents of the darkness?
- Might Wild Magic surges worsen the catastrophe?

[[Archmagister Corwin Ashford]] has called for increased sorcerer recruitment, while [[High Confessor Maren]] demands closer church oversight.

## Organizations

### The Academy Conduits
Sorcerers enrolled at the [[Arcane Academy]] form an informal society. They share techniques for control and support each other through the challenges of innate magic.

### The Dragonmarked
[[House Valdren]] sorcerers who claim draconic bloodline. They serve the house as magical assets and carry considerable prestige on the [[Western Shore]].

### The Free Sparks
An underground network of unregistered sorcerers who refuse church oversight. They meet in secret, share survival techniques, and protect members from Inquisition attention.

### The Storm Circle
Wild Magic sorcerers who've learned to embrace chaos rather than fear it. Based somewhere in the [[Northlands]], they believe their surges connect to primal forces older than the Faith.

## Notable Sorcerers

| Name | Origin | Affiliation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Lady Celeste Valdren | Draconic | [[House Valdren]], court mage |
| "Ember" | Wild Magic | Free Sparks leader, wanted |
| Master Reynard | Clockwork | [[Arcane Academy]] researcher |
| The Whispered One | Aberrant | Unknown, rumored Karath agent |
| Spark-Sister Mira | Draconic | Church-sanctioned, Hospitaller |
