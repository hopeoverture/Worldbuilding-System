# Warlock

> [!info] Class Summary
> Warlocks gain power through pacts with otherworldly entities. In Eldermyr, they are the most feared and persecuted spellcasters—the [[Faith of the Three]] considers all pacts heretical, and the Inquisition hunts pact-bound mages with particular fervor. Yet power demands sacrifice, and some pay willingly.

## Overview

Warlocks forge bargains with powerful beings—archfey, fiends, celestials, or entities beyond comprehension. In exchange for service (or something more precious), they receive magical power that replenishes quickly but operates differently from other casters. Their Eldritch Blast makes them consistent damage dealers, while Invocations customize their abilities.

## Core Mechanics

### Key Statistics
| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Hit Die** | d8 |
| **Primary Ability** | Charisma |
| **Saving Throws** | Wisdom, Charisma |
| **Armor** | Light |
| **Weapons** | Simple |

### Pact Magic
Few spell slots (max 4) that recharge on short rest. All cast at highest available level (up to 5th). Mystic Arcanum for 6th-9th level spells.

### Eldritch Invocations
Customizable abilities that enhance Eldritch Blast, grant at-will spells, or provide unique powers.

### Key Features
- **Pact Boon** (3rd): Blade, Chain, or Tome
- **Mystic Arcanum** (11th+): Higher-level spells
- **Eldritch Master** (20th): Restore all slots once per day

### Subclasses (Otherworldly Patrons)
| Patron | Theme |
|--------|-------|

| **Celestial** | Upper Planes, healing and radiance |
| **Fiend** | Demon/devil, fire and survival |
| **Great Old One** | Alien entity, psychic terror |

## Warlocks in Eldermyr

### The Forbidden Path

The [[Faith of the Three]] explicitly forbids pacts with otherworldly entities. According to Church doctrine:

- The Three created all that is good and true
- Entities offering pacts are either demons, deceptions, or worse
- Accepting such bargains corrupts the soul irredeemably
- All warlocks are heretics deserving punishment

In practice, warlocks exist throughout Eldermyr—hidden, hunted, and desperately powerful.

### Patron Types in Eldermyr

**Archfey Pacts**
The most "acceptable" warlock type—fey are natural, not demonic. Archfey warlocks typically encounter their patrons in [[Myrkvid]] or other wild places. Known fey lords who accept pacts include:
- The Thornqueen (demands aesthetic sacrifice)
- The Lord of the Wild Hunt (demands worthy prey)
- The Maiden of Moonlight (demands secrets)

**Celestial Pacts**
Theologically confusing for the Church. If celestials serve the Three, are celestial warlocks actually blessed? The Church says no—true divine servants grant power through faith (clerics/paladins), not bargains. Some theorize celestial warlocks commune with beings the Three have rejected.

**Fiend Pacts**
The classic heresy. Devils and demons offer power freely—and the price is always the soul eventually. Fiend warlocks are hunted relentlessly, executed publicly, and used as examples to frighten the faithful.

**Great Old One Pacts**
The most terrifying possibility. The Church refuses to acknowledge that entities exist beyond the Three's creation, but Great Old One warlocks prove otherwise. [[The Unnamed]] may be such an entity—raising the horrible possibility that some warlocks serve it directly.

### Training Paths

**The Desperate Bargain**
Most warlocks didn't seek power—they made a desperate deal in a moment of crisis. The soldier who sold their soul for vengeance. The dying parent who bargained for their child's life. The prisoner who accepted any escape.

**The Willing Seeker**
Some deliberately seek patrons, believing the power worth any price. They research summoning rituals, seek wild places where the veil thins, or follow rumors of entities willing to bargain.

**The Inherited Pact**
Certain bloodlines carry pact obligations across generations. A great-grandmother's bargain might bind her descendants to service. These "legacy warlocks" have no choice—the pact claimed them at birth.

**The Accidental Touch**
Occasionally, beings reach out unbidden. A dream, a whisper, a momentary contact that leaves power behind. These warlocks often don't understand their own abilities.

### Role in the Current Crisis

Warlocks occupy a dangerous position:

- **Fiend warlocks** might oppose [[The Unnamed]] (fiends don't like competition)
- **Great Old One warlocks** might serve it (or serve its enemies)
- **Archfey warlocks** have insights into ancient powers
- **Celestial warlocks** could be crucial—or corrupted
- **Any warlock** might be framed as an Unnamed servant

The Inquisition has increased persecution, using the crisis as justification for wider hunts. Innocent magic-users have been executed on suspicion of pact-making.

### Social Standing

Warlocks are outcasts:

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| The Church | Heretics, execution-worthy |
| Nobility | Dangerous secrets, deniable assets |
| Common Folk | Feared witches, sometimes sought for power |
| [[Arcane Academy]] | Academic curiosity, careful distance |
| Military | Forbidden but sometimes employed |

## Organizations

### The Hidden Court
Archfey warlocks who serve [[Myrkvid]]'s fey lords. They meet at solstices deep in the Dark Wood, owing allegiance to beings older than the Faith.

### The Infernal Lodge
A secret society of fiend warlocks who've learned to cooperate despite serving different diabolic masters. They believe unity provides some protection against Inquisition and patron alike.

### The Veiled
Warlocks of all types who've learned to hide their nature. They pose as sorcerers, eccentric scholars, or hedge witches. The Veiled share techniques for concealment and warn each other of Inquisition movements.

### The Willing
Those who embrace their pacts openly—living outside society, offering their services to those desperate enough to employ them. They operate in [[Port Corsair]] and the wilds beyond law.

## Notable Warlocks

| Name | Patron | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| "The Wolf of Myrkvid" | Archfey (Wild Hunt) | Hidden Court leader |
| Mother Ashgrove | Fiend | Veiled elder, secretly alive |
| Brother Illuminus | Celestial | Church prisoner, status unknown |
| The Whisperer | Great Old One | Rumored [[Karath]] agent |
| Captain Rosa Blacktide | Fiend | [[Port Corsair]] leader, open |

## Playing a Warlock in Eldermyr

### Character Concepts
- An archfey warlock trying to escape an impossible bargain
- A celestial warlock challenging Church doctrine about their nature
- A fiend warlock seeking redemption before collection day
- A Great Old One warlock fleeing the Inquisition—innocent of serving [[The Unnamed]]
- A legacy warlock resenting a pact they never chose

### Connections to the Crisis
- Great Old One patrons might have knowledge of [[The Unnamed]]
- The Inquisition's persecution creates false enemies
- [[House Karath]] actively recruits or corrupts warlocks
- Some patrons oppose the ancient evil rising

### Subclass Integration
| Patron | Eldermyr Connection |
|--------|---------------------|
| Archfey | Myrkvid fey lords, Old Ways adjacent |
| Celestial | Theological confusion, possible Church allies |
| Fiend | Maximum persecution, secret survival |
| Great Old One | Unnamed connection suspected |

### The Warlock's Dilemma
Every warlock faces an impossible question: Can they use their power for good despite its tainted source? The Church says no—the pact damns regardless of deeds. But facing [[The Unnamed]], warlock power might be necessary. Some believe redemption possible; others accept damnation and fight anyway.
