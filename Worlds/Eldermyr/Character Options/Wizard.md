# Wizard

> [!info] Class Summary
> Wizards master magic through study, discipline, and intellect. In Eldermyr, the [[Arcane Academy]] in [[Aldersgate]] represents the pinnacle of arcane learning. Wizards are respected scholars whose power comes from knowledge—making them both valued and feared throughout the realm.

## Overview

Wizards learn magic through rigorous study, recording spells in their spellbooks and preparing different magic each day. They have access to more spells than any other class and can copy new ones continuously, building vast repositories of arcane knowledge. What they lack in innate power, they make up for in versatility.

## Wizards in Eldermyr

### The Arcane Academy

The [[Arcane Academy]] in [[Aldersgate]] is Eldermyr's premier magical institution, founded during the reconstruction after [[The Great War]]. Under [[Archmagister Corwin Ashford]], it trains hundreds of wizards while conducting research into all aspects of the arcane.

**Academy Structure:**
| Rank | Role |
|------|------|
| Archmagister | Supreme authority |
| Magister | Senior faculty, researchers |
| Professor | Teaching faculty |
| Fellow | Advanced student, researcher |
| Scholar | Student, proven basic competency |
| Apprentice | Beginning student |

**The Eight Schools:**
While D&D recognizes four schools in 2024, the Academy maintains the traditional eight-school structure (Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, Transmutation). Each has a Master who oversees curriculum and research.

### Regional Variations

**Academy Orthodoxy**
The dominant tradition, emphasizing careful study, safety protocols, and theoretical understanding. Academy wizards are disciplined, systematic, and sometimes criticized as overly cautious.

**The Eastern Method**
[[House Thorne]] territory maintains a pragmatic tradition focused on battlefield magic. [[Stahlburg]]'s military academy includes basic arcane training. These "battle mages" prioritize evocation and abjuration.

**The Western Trade**
[[Porto Valdris]] wizards focus on practical magic—preserving goods, protecting ships, detecting counterfeit currency. Less prestigious but highly profitable.

**Hedge Wizardry**
Self-taught wizards who learned from found spellbooks, traveling teachers, or pure experimentation. The Academy dismisses them as dangerous amateurs; they counter that orthodox training stifles innovation.

### Training Paths

**Academy Admission**
The formal path requires passing entrance examinations, providing tuition (or scholarship), and committing to seven years of study. Graduates earn the title "Magister" and Academy privileges.

**Apprenticeship**
Traditional wizard training involves studying under a master for years. The apprentice manages household, assists with research, and gradually learns the master's spells. Many hedge wizards trained this way.

**Self-Teaching**
Rarely successful but historically significant. Some of history's greatest wizards taught themselves from recovered texts. The process is dangerous—many die to miscast spells.

**The Magical Inheritance**
Wizard families pass down spellbooks, creating magical lineages. These "legacy wizards" begin with significant advantages but face pressure to maintain family traditions.

### Role in the Current Crisis

Wizards are essential to fighting [[The Unnamed]]:

- **Research**: The Academy studies the ancient evil, seeking weaknesses
- **Combat**: Evocation wizards provide devastating magical firepower
- **Protection**: Abjurers ward camps and fortifications
- **Intelligence**: Diviners attempt to scry the enemy's movements
- **The Forbidden**: Necromancy might hold keys to defeating undeath

[[Archmagister Corwin Ashford]] has mobilized Academy resources for the war effort, sending graduates to support [[Grey Wardens]] and noble forces alike.

### Social Standing

Wizards enjoy considerable respect:

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Nobility | Valued advisors, court mages |
| Common Folk | Awe mixed with fear |
| [[Faith of the Three]] | Respectful distance, occasional tension |
| Military | Strategic assets |
| Other Mages | Intellectual superiors (in their view) |

## Organizations

### The Arcane Academy
Eldermyr's premier magical institution, led by [[Archmagister Corwin Ashford]]. Hundreds of wizards study and research under its auspices.

### The Council of Magisters
Senior Academy faculty who advise the Archmagister and set policy. Currently debating how deeply to involve the Academy in the succession conflict.

### The War College
[[Stahlburg]]'s military academy includes an arcane division training battle mages. Commandant Viktor Steelheart oversees practical combat magic instruction.

### The Merchant Mages Guild
[[Western Shore]] wizards who specialize in commercial applications. Based in [[Porto Valdris]], they provide magical services for trade.

### The Circle of Eight
Secret society of school masters who allegedly preserve dangerous knowledge too important to destroy but too risky to share openly.

## Notable Wizards

| Name | School | Affiliation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [[Archmagister Corwin Ashford]] | Divination | [[Arcane Academy]] leader |
| Master Seraphina Ashford | Illusion | Academy, secretly fey-touched |
| Battlemagister Klaus | Evocation | War College commander |
| Sage Wilhelmina | Abjuration | Academy, ancient wards expert |
| "The Unnamed's Bane" | Unknown | Legendary, possibly mythical |

## Playing a Wizard in Eldermyr

### Character Concepts
- An Academy graduate investigating corruption in the institution
- A battle mage questioning the ethics of magical warfare
- A hedge wizard proving themselves against Academy snobbery
- A necromancy student whose research became too personal
- A diviner who glimpsed [[The Unnamed]]'s true nature

### Connections to the Crisis
- Academy research may hold keys to defeating [[The Unnamed]]
- Forbidden necromantic knowledge becomes tempting
- Divination struggles to pierce the ancient evil's obscuring power
- Ancient spellbooks from before [[The Great War]] contain lost magic

### Subclass Integration
| School | Eldermyr Connection |
|--------|---------------------|
| Abjuration | Ward specialists, protection experts |
| Divination | Seers, intelligence gatherers |
| Evocation | Battle mages, military assets |
| Illusion | Court mages, subtle operatives |

### The Necromancy Question
The Academy officially condemns necromancy—raising the dead is the domain of [[The Unnamed]]. Unofficially, understanding undeath may be essential to defeating it. Some wizards study forbidden texts in secret; others believe any necromantic research aids the enemy.
