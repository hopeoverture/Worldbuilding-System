# Aleksei Karath

## Overview
Aleksei Karath is the sixteen-year-old son and heir of Lord Draven Karath. He has been raised in the shadow of his house's shame, taught to hate the families that destroyed his great-grandfather and humiliated his father. But unlike Draven, Aleksei is not yet consumed by bitterness. He stands at a crossroads: follow his father into darkness, or find another path. The realm's future may depend on which choice he makes.

## Personality

### The Conflict
Aleksei loves his father but fears what Draven is becoming. He has been raised on stories of Karath glory and Karath grievance, but he has also seen the suffering of the Reach's people. He wonders if revenge is worth the cost.

### The Intelligence
Aleksei is clever—perhaps too clever for his own good. He sees through his father's rationalizations, notices the changes in Draven's behavior, and suspects that something is deeply wrong. He lacks the power to act on his suspicions.

### The Loyalty
Despite his doubts, Aleksei is loyal to his family. He will not betray his father to outsiders. But he might try to save Draven from himself, even if Draven doesn't want to be saved.

## Role in the Crisis

### Father's Heir
As Draven's only son, Aleksei will inherit whatever House Karath becomes. If Draven achieves his goals, Aleksei will rule a restored Karath domain. If Draven fails, Aleksei may inherit only ashes.

### The Alternative
Some in the realm see Aleksei as an alternative to his father. If Draven goes too far, Aleksei could be supported as a more moderate Karath leader. This would require Aleksei to move against his own father—something he is not willing to do. Yet.

### The Dreams
Aleksei has begun having the same dreams his father has—visions of the Figure, whispers of power. The Unnamed is reaching for him too. So far, he has resisted. So far.

## Relationships

### With Draven
Aleksei loves and fears his father. He remembers the man Draven was before the dreams began—stern but fair, bitter but not cruel. He mourns the father he is losing to the darkness.

### With Yelena
His aunt Yelena is Aleksei's confidant. She shares his concerns about Draven. Together, they might be able to save their family—or at least survive its fall.

### With the Realm
Aleksei has met few people outside the Reach. His father keeps him close, perhaps fearing that exposure to the wider realm would weaken his resolve. Aleksei is curious about the world beyond his cursed homeland.

## Secrets

1. **He Knows About the Dreams.** Aleksei has overheard his father speaking to the Figure in his sleep. He knows Draven is in contact with something in the Ashen Fields. He is terrified.

2. **He Has a Plan.** If Draven cannot be saved, Aleksei has quietly begun preparing. He has hidden supplies, made contacts among the servants, and identified who might support him if the worst happens.

3. **The Unnamed Wants Him.** The thing beneath the Fields has noticed Aleksei's resistance. It sees him as a challenge—and a potential prize. If it cannot claim Draven, it will try for the son.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Reluctant Heir:** The party might be tasked with extracting Aleksei from Chernogrod before Draven goes too far. Or Aleksei might seek them out, looking for allies.

2. **Save the Father:** Aleksei asks the party to help him save Draven from the Unnamed's influence. This would require confronting whatever Draven has become.

3. **The Choice:** Aleksei must choose between family loyalty and the realm's survival. The party's actions might tip the balance.
