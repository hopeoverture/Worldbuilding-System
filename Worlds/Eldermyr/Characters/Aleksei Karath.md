# Aleksei Karath

## Overview
Aleksei Karath is the sixteen-year-old son and heir of [[Lord Draven Karath]]. He has been raised in the shadow of his house's shame, taught to hate the families that destroyed his great-grandfather and humiliated his father. But unlike [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]], Aleksei is not yet consumed by bitterness. He stands at a crossroads: follow his father into darkness, or find another path. The realm's future may depend on which choice he makes.

## Personality

### The Conflict
Aleksei loves his father but fears what [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] is becoming. He has been raised on stories of Karath glory and Karath grievance, but he has also seen the suffering of [[The Karath Reach|the Reach]]'s people. He wonders if revenge is worth the cost.

### The Intelligence
Aleksei is clever—perhaps too clever for his own good. He sees through his father's rationalizations, notices the changes in [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s behavior, and suspects that something is deeply wrong. He lacks [[Magic of Eldermyr|the power]] to act on his suspicions.

### The Loyalty
Despite his doubts, Aleksei is loyal to his family. He will not betray his father to outsiders. But he might try to save [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] from himself, even if [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] doesn't want to be saved.

## Role in the Crisis

### Father's Heir
As [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s only son, Aleksei will inherit whatever [[House Karath]] becomes. If [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] achieves his goals, Aleksei will rule a restored Karath domain. If [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] fails, Aleksei may inherit only ashes.

### The Alternative
Some in the realm see Aleksei as an alternative to his father. If [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] goes too far, Aleksei could be supported as a more moderate Karath leader. This would require Aleksei to move against his own father—something he is not willing to do. Yet.

### The Dreams
Aleksei has begun having the same dreams his father has—visions of [[The Mad King|the Figure]], whispers of power. [[The Unnamed]] is reaching for him too. So far, he has resisted. So far.

## Relationships

### With [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]
Aleksei loves and fears his father. He remembers the man [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] was before the dreams began—stern but fair, bitter but not cruel. He mourns the father he is losing to the darkness.

### With [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]]
His aunt [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] is Aleksei's confidant. She shares his concerns about [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]. Together, they might be able to save their family—or at least survive its fall.

### With the Realm
Aleksei has met few people outside [[The Karath Reach|the Reach]]. His father keeps him close, perhaps fearing that exposure to the wider realm would weaken his resolve. Aleksei is curious about the world beyond his cursed homeland.

## Secrets

1. **He Knows About the Dreams.** Aleksei has overheard his father speaking to [[The Mad King]] in his sleep. He knows [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] is in contact with something in [[The Ashen Fields]]. He is terrified.

2. **He Has a Plan.** If [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] cannot be saved, Aleksei has quietly begun preparing. He has hidden supplies, made contacts among the servants, and identified who might support him if the worst happens.

3. **[[The Unnamed]] Wants Him.** [[The Unnamed|The thing beneath]] the Fields has noticed Aleksei's resistance. It sees him as a challenge—and a potential prize. If it cannot claim [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]], it will try for the son.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Reluctant Heir:** The party might be tasked with extracting Aleksei from [[Chernogrod]] before [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] goes too far. Or Aleksei might seek them out, looking for allies.

2. **Save the Father:** Aleksei asks the party to help him save [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] from [[The Unnamed|the Unnamed]]'s influence. This would require confronting whatever [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has become.

3. **The Choice:** Aleksei must choose between family loyalty and the realm's survival. The party's actions might tip the balance.
