# Black Donal

## Overview
Black Donal is the man who makes the Valdren blockade a joke—the leader of the Dock Runners, a smuggling operation that moves contraband around, through, and under the naval cordon choking [[Eldoria]]. Bold, charismatic, and utterly without political loyalty, he sees the succession crisis as the business opportunity of a lifetime. The factions need goods the blockade prevents; Donal provides them. For a price.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Black Donal earned his name from his hair—a wild mane of jet-black curls that he wears long and unbound, defying the practical customs of sailors everywhere. He's forty-two years old, with the lean, weathered look of a man who's spent more time on water than land. His face is sharp-featured and tanned dark, with a twice-broken nose and a thin scar along his jaw. His eyes are dark brown and always laughing at some private joke—usually at someone else's expense. He moves with the easy confidence of a born sailor, rolling with whatever surface he's standing on.

### Attire
Donal dresses like the successful smuggler he is—expensive clothes worn carelessly, a mix of sailor's practicality and merchant's wealth. His coat is fine leather over a silk shirt that's usually half-unbuttoned. He wears a cutlass and two pistols (rare firearms he's enormously proud of) openly; concealed weapons are for people who aren't confident enough to fight openly.

## Personality

### Traits
1. He laughs at everything—danger, threats, death itself—finding life too absurd to take seriously
2. He's fanatically loyal to his crew; cross one of them, and you've crossed him

### Ideals
**Freedom Above All:** "Kings and lords fight over who gets to sit in a chair. I sail where I want, take what I want, and answer to no one. That's the only crown worth wearing."

### Bonds
His crew—the Dock Runners—are his family. He's built something with them, and he'll burn anyone who threatens it.

### Flaws
His contempt for authority makes him underestimate how dangerous the factions can be when sufficiently motivated. He's made enemies who don't share his sense of humor about being robbed.

### Demeanor
Donal presents himself as a charming rogue—all easy smiles and theatrical bows, the kind of man who makes crime look glamorous. But the charm is a weapon, and behind the laughing eyes is a man who's killed competitors, outmaneuvered navies, and built an empire on the water.

## Role

### Function
**Primary:** Smuggler Contact / Criminal Faction Leader

**Secondary:** Information Source (maritime)

### Expertise
- Smuggling routes around (and through) the blockade
- The Valdren naval patrol patterns
- Ship capabilities and captains for hire
- The underground economy of the Docks

### Availability
- Found at [[The Drowned Rat Tavern]] most evenings
- Has offices (such as they are) in a warehouse near the old sea wall
- Can be reached through any dock worker who knows the right questions
- Personally runs special jobs—he hasn't given up sailing entirely

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Sailor / Pirate

**Occupation:** Smuggler King

**Path:** Donal grew up on the docks, went to sea at fourteen, and discovered he had a gift for avoiding customs inspectors. By twenty, he was running his own boat; by thirty, a small fleet. The Valdren blockade should have ruined him—instead, he saw opportunity. He consolidated the independent smugglers into the Dock Runners and became the only reliable way to move goods in or out of [[Eldoria]].

### History with Protagonists
Adventurers who need something moved—or need to move themselves—will eventually hear Donal's name. He deals with anyone who has coin, asks few questions, and delivers what he promises.

### Current Situation
The blockade has made Donal richer than he ever imagined. Every faction needs goods the blockade prevents; refugees pay premium for passage out; information about the blockade's gaps sells for fortunes. He's playing all sides simultaneously, knowing that whoever wins, they'll still need smugglers.

### Combat Role
Donal fights like a swashbuckler—mobile, flashy, and surprisingly effective. He prefers one-on-one duels where his skills shine, and he's not above shooting first if numbers are against him. His crew fights as a unit; he fights as a distraction.

- Cunning Action
- Uncanny Dodge
- Swashbuckler: Fancy Footwork, Rakish Audacity, Panache

## Species Traits
- Human Versatility

## Feats
- Gunner (proficient with firearms, no disadvantage at close range)
- Mobile (+10 speed, no opportunity attacks after melee attack)

## Equipment

### Notable Items
- **The Black Cutlass:** His signature weapon, taken from a Valdren captain he defeated
- **The Twins:** A matched pair of flintlock pistols, engraved with sea serpents
- **Captain's Hat:** A wide-brimmed hat that's survived a dozen close calls
- **Donal's Map:** A coded chart of every smuggling route around the blockade

### Resources
- The Dock Runners (30+ smugglers, 6 boats)
- Network of contacts in every dock district
- Hidden caches of smuggled goods throughout [[Eldoria]]
- Enough coin to bribe most officials

## Relationships

### To Protagonists
A useful criminal contact who can move people and goods around the blockade. He's charming and generally reliable—as long as you pay him.

### Personal Life
- Never married—"Can't cage a bird like me"
- Has children in three port cities (that he knows of)
- Genuinely loves his crew; will avenge any of them
- Has a complicated arrangement with [[Saltbeard Pete]]—competitor and cooperator

### Enemies
- [[House Valdren]]'s navy (they'd love to hang him)
- [[Captain Helena Stern]] (keeps trying to catch him)
- [[The Rat King]] (territorial dispute)
- Various officials he's bribed who resent it

## Story Role

### Purpose
Black Donal represents the free-wheeling criminal element that thrives in chaos—no political loyalty, no ideological commitment, just profit and freedom. He's a source of smuggling services, maritime information, and the cynical perspective on the succession crisis.

### Arc
His arc involves the increasing pressure from all sides. The factions tolerate him because they need him, but that tolerance has limits. Eventually, someone will decide he knows too much or has too much power. He'll need to choose sides, disappear, or fight.

### Stakes
If Donal falls, the blockade becomes much more effective. Goods stop flowing; refugees can't escape; the factions lose a key resource. The Dock Runners would splinter without his leadership.

### Complications
- [[Saltbeard Pete]] is playing both sides, and Donal suspects but can't prove it
- He's been taking contracts from [[House Thorne]] without knowing about [[The Rat King]]'s connection
- The Valdren navy has been getting closer—someone is leaking patrol routes
- His second-in-command is getting ambitious

## Roleplay Notes

### Voice & Mannerisms
- Speaks with an easy, rolling accent that could be from anywhere
- Laughs frequently, even at threats
- Makes grand, theatrical gestures
- Calls everyone "friend" until they prove otherwise
- Quotes poetry at unexpected moments

### Topics of Interest
- Ships and sailing (his true love)
- The absurdity of politics
- The art of evading authority
- Freedom and what it means

### Conversation Hooks
- "Friend! You look like someone who needs something moved. Or someone who needs to move."
- "The blockade? A minor inconvenience. More of a premium, really."
- "I don't take sides in politics. I take coin from all of them."

### Sample Dialogue

> "Kings, lords, factions—they fight over chairs and titles. Me? I've got the sea, my ship, and my crew. That's all the kingdom I need."

> "Dangerous? Friend, everything's dangerous. The difference is whether you laugh about it or cry."

> "I've outrun Valdren patrol ships, bribed customs in six ports, and once talked my way out of a hanging. What do you think a little blockade is going to do?"

## Secrets

1. He's been running sensitive cargo for [[House Thorne]] without knowing the full extent of their operations—including supplies that have ended up supporting [[The Rat King]]'s guild.

2. He knows there's a traitor in his organization—someone leaking routes to the Valdren navy. He's been feeding different routes to different crew members to identify them.

3. His "legendary" duel with the Valdren captain where he won the Black Cutlass... wasn't quite a fair fight. The captain was poisoned by a mutual acquaintance. Donal has kept the secret for fifteen years.

### Portrait (Bust)
**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of Black Donal, smuggler king and leader of the Dock Runners, forty-two years old with the lean, weathered look of a man who has spent more time on water than land. A sharp-featured face tanned dark by sun and salt wind, with a twice-broken nose and a thin white scar along his jaw—the marks of a life spent in danger and loving it. Dark brown eyes that are always laughing at some private joke, usually at someone else's expense—eyes that have watched men drown and counted the profit. His most distinctive feature is his hair: a wild mane of jet-black curls worn long and unbound, defying the practical customs of sailors everywhere, as much a statement as a style. A mouth curved in the perpetual half-smile of a man who finds the world absurd and himself the only one in on the joke. Dressed in expensive clothes worn carelessly—a fine leather coat over a silk shirt that's half-unbuttoned, the wealth of successful crime displayed with rakish disregard. A captain's hat, wide-brimmed and weather-stained, cocked at an angle that suggests both style and practical shade. The hilts of a cutlass and two pistols visible—he carries his weapons openly, confident enough to advertise. Expression of charming menace, the look of someone who could sell you your own ship and make you thank him for it. The hint of steel behind the laughter, the calculation behind the charm. Background: the docks of Eldoria at dusk, ships at anchor and the gleam of water, the domain of a man who answers to no flag. Golden hour light catching the sea behind him and the gold in his smile. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on weathered sailor's features and fine clothing, dramatic atmosphere of maritime adventure, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy swashbuckler smuggler portrait illustration.

## Notes
Black Donal represents the romantic criminal—the charming rogue who makes crime look glamorous. He's useful for smuggling quests, maritime adventures, and the cynical perspective on the faction war. His eventual discovery that [[House Thorne]] has been using him connects the criminal elements to the political plot.
