# Captain Alonzo the Bold

## Overview
Captain Alonzo the Bold is the Admiral of the Valdren Fleet and the most famous sailor in Eldermyr. Born in [[Marevento]], he rose from common shipwright's son to command the most powerful navy on the Trader's Sea. His loyalty to [[House Valdren]] is absolute, but his concern for his hometown and crew sometimes conflicts with his lord's political ambitions. In the coming crisis, the fleet he commands may be the decisive force—or the final refuge.

## History

### Origins
Alonzo was born in [[Marevento]] to a family of shipwrights. He went to sea at fourteen, proved himself in battle against pirates at twenty, and earned his famous nickname by sailing into a storm to rescue a merchant convoy at twenty-five. Lord Marcus Valdren noticed him and sponsored his rise.

### Naval Career
By thirty-five, Alonzo commanded a squadron. By forty, the entire fleet. He has fought pirates, foreign navies, and the occasional sea monster. He has never lost a ship under his personal command. The sailors worship him; the officers respect him; the enemies fear him.

### Present Day
With [[Lord Varic Valdren|Lord Varic]] playing political games in [[Aldersgate]], someone needs to actually run the fleet. Alonzo does so efficiently, but he worries. The ships are being positioned for civil war, not defense. His sailors might have to fight their countrymen.

## Personality

### The Commander
Alonzo leads from the front. He sleeps on deck in rough weather, eats the same rations as his crew, and knows every sailor by name. His men would sail into hell for him—and he would never ask them to unless he was going first.

### The Patriot
Alonzo loves Eldermyr. He serves [[House Valdren]] because they protect [[The Western Shore|the coast]], but his loyalty is to the realm and its people. If Valdren interests diverge from the realm's interests, Alonzo faces an impossible choice.

### The Practical Man
Alonzo has no time for politics. He sees problems and solves them. The succession crisis frustrates him—all this scheming while the realm faces real threats. He has heard about the curse in [[The Karath Reach|the Reach]]. He wonders if anyone in [[Aldersgate]] has.

## Role in the Crisis

### Naval Power
The Valdren Fleet is the strongest naval force in Eldermyr. It could blockade any port, transport any army, or evacuate any population. In a civil war, controlling the fleet means controlling the seas.

### [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]]'s Tool
[[Lord Varic Valdren|Lord Varic]] considers Alonzo a loyal tool—useful for projecting power. Alonzo knows this. He accepts it because Valdren rule has been good for [[The Western Shore|the coast]]. But he has limits, and [[Lord Varic Valdren]] may not know where they are.

### The Escape Option
If the worst happens—if the realm falls to civil war or the curse spreads beyond control—Alonzo's fleet could evacuate tens of thousands to safety. He has quietly prepared for this possibility.

## Relationships

### With [[House Valdren]]
Alonzo is loyal to the house but not blind to its flaws. He respects [[Lord Varic Valdren|Lord Varic]]'s intelligence but dislikes his methods. He would obey most orders. He would refuse some.

### With [[Marevento]]
Alonzo never forgot his hometown. He returns whenever he can, donates to the shipwright families, and ensures the yards get fair contracts. [[Marevento]] loves him as a native son who made good.

### With the Crew
The sailors of the Valdren Fleet are Alonzo's true family. He has no wife, no children—only the fleet. He would sacrifice anything for his people.

## Secrets

1. **He Has a Plan.** Alonzo has quietly prepared evacuation routes, supply caches, and safe harbors. If Eldermyr falls, he will save as many as he can. This plan includes abandoning [[House Valdren]] if necessary.

2. **He's Been Contacted.** Representatives of foreign powers have approached Alonzo, offering him command of their navies if he defects. He has refused. So far.

3. **He Knows About [[Edric Valdren|Edric]].** Alonzo has met young [[Edric Valdren]] and thinks the boy might make a good king—if he lives long enough. He has considered what it would take to protect the heir from all threats, including [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]].

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Fleet's Choice:** If civil war breaks out, whose side does the fleet take? The party might need to convince Alonzo to support their faction—or convince him to stay neutral.

2. **Evacuation:** If the curse spreads, Alonzo's fleet is the realm's best hope. The party might need to help coordinate a mass evacuation.

3. **The Admiral's Secret:** Alonzo knows something about Valdren plans that could change everything. Getting him to share it requires earning his trust.
