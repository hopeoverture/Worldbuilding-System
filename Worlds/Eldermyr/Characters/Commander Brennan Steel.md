# Commander Brennan Steel

## Overview
Commander Brennan Steel is a bull of a man in late middle age who rose from common birth to command the elite Crown Guard through merit, loyalty, and an absolute refusal to break. His soldiers would follow him into the Hells—and in [[Eldoria]]'s current crisis, they may have to. He's fiercely loyal to [[Lord Castellan Maren Ashford]] personally and represents one of the few truly incorruptible forces in a city drowning in factional scheming.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Brennan Steel earned his surname long before he earned his rank—he's built like an ox, broad-shouldered and thick-necked, with arms like tree limbs and hands that could crush a man's skull. Fifty-four years old, his black hair has gone iron-grey at the temples, but his body remains solid with muscle earned through a lifetime of training that continues every dawn. His face is blunt and honest, with a twice-broken nose, a heavy brow, and small, shrewd eyes that miss nothing on a battlefield. A massive scar runs from his forehead through his left eyebrow and down his cheek—a memento from [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] where he earned his commission.

### Attire
The Commander wears the black and silver of the Crown Guard, his armor practical rather than ceremonial—well-maintained plate that shows the dents and scratches of actual use. He carries a bastard sword that's seen more action than most men twice his rank, and a heavy shield bearing the crown-and-tower emblem of the Guard. Off-duty, he dresses simply in military tunics, uncomfortable in any clothing that isn't ready for a fight.

## Personality

### Traits
1. He speaks in short, direct sentences—lies and politics require too many words
2. He trains with his men every morning without exception, believing a commander who can't keep up has no right to give orders

### Ideals
**Loyalty Earned:** "I've served three commanders and two kings. I follow the Castellan because he deserves following, not because of his title."

### Bonds
The Crown Guard is his family—he never married, never had children, poured everything into the men and women under his command. Losing them to factional violence feels like losing his own blood.

### Flaws
His absolute loyalty makes him inflexible. He struggles to consider that the Castellan might be wrong, that orders might need questioning, or that compromise might be necessary. Black and white are comfortable; grey is treacherous.

### Demeanor
Brennan Steel presents exactly what he is: a soldier, blunt and professional. He has no patience for court politics, no skill at dissembling, and no interest in pretending otherwise. What you see is what you get—and what you get is competent, loyal, and dangerous.

## Role

### Function
**Primary:** Military Ally / Quest-giver

**Secondary:** Combat Support

### Expertise
- Military tactics and urban defense
- Assessing threats and personnel
- Training soldiers and breaking untrained fighters
- The layout of [[Eldoria]]'s defenses and their weaknesses

### Availability
- Found at the Crown Guard barracks or the palace
- Accessible through proper military channels or the Castellan's introduction
- Personally leads patrols through troubled districts at unpredictable times
- More approachable after hours at the Crossed Swords Inn

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Soldier

**Occupation:** Commander of the Crown Guard

**Path:** Born to a blacksmith in the Common Quarters, Brennan enlisted in the Crown Guard at sixteen. [[The Great War]] found him a sergeant; [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] made him a hero. He carried the wounded Castellan to safety through enemy lines, earning his commission and his commander's eternal trust. Thirty-eight years of service later, he leads the Guard that once seemed impossibly above him.

### History with Protagonists
Brennan respects competence and despises pretension. Adventurers who prove themselves capable and straightforward will find a valuable ally. Those who play political games will find a wall of silence and suspicion.

### Current Situation
The Commander faces an impossible task: keeping order in a city where every faction has their own armed men, the Watch is undermanned and unreliable, and his own forces are stretched to breaking point. He sleeps four hours a night and spends the rest maintaining the thin line between peace and chaos.

### Resources
- Command of 3,000 Crown Guard soldiers
- Access to the crown armory
- Authority to commandeer resources for defense
- A network of loyal veterans throughout the city

## Relationships

### To Protagonists
A potential employer for military tasks, combat ally, and one of the few genuinely trustworthy people in [[Eldoria]]. His trust is hard to earn but absolute once given.

### Personal Life
- Never married—the Guard is his family
- Maintains friendships with veterans scattered through the city's trades
- [[Old Marta]] at the Crossed Swords was a fellow soldier; they share drinks and memories
- Has a nephew in the City Watch he's quietly trying to protect from the chaos

### Enemies
- Every faction would prefer a more pliable Guard commander
- Criminal organizations target his patrols
- Someone has been trying to bribe his lieutenants (unsuccessfully)

## Story Role

### Purpose
Brennan represents military honor in a dishonorable time—a rock of integrity in a sea of corruption. He exists to give players a reliable ally, demonstrate the human cost of the crisis on ordinary soldiers, and provide legitimate combat support when needed.

### Arc
His arc involves the strain of maintaining integrity when everyone around him is compromising. He may be forced to choose between loyalty to the Castellan and loyalty to his men—or discover his commander isn't the man he believed.

### Stakes
If Brennan falls or loses faith, the Crown Guard loses its cohesion. The 3,000 soldiers who hold [[Eldoria]] together would fragment, with factions recruiting the pieces. The city would have days before open warfare.

### Complications
- His nephew in the Watch has gotten involved with dangerous elements
- One of his lieutenants has a gambling debt to the wrong people
- His absolute loyalty to the Castellan could be exploited if Ashford makes wrong choices
- A sergeant who served with him at Ashen Fields has joined [[House Thorne]]'s faction

## Roleplay Notes

### Voice & Mannerisms
- Speaks in short, declarative sentences; hates verbal fencing
- Habit of cracking his knuckles when thinking
- Addresses everyone by rank or "citizen"—never names until they've earned it
- Stands at parade rest even in casual conversation
- Drinks ale, never wine; considers wine pretentious

### Topics of Interest
- Military tactics and history
- The maintenance of arms and armor
- Stories of [[The Great War]] and [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]
- The decline of martial standards in noble youth

### Conversation Hooks
- "You handle yourself well. Where did you train?"
- "The Watch found another body in the Warrens. I don't have men to spare. You look capable."
- "I don't trust easy. But if you earn it, you'll have an ally worth having."

### Sample Dialogue

> "Politics is just war with more words and less honesty. I prefer the real thing—at least I know where I stand."

> "My men are dying for a city that can't decide who it wants to be ruled by. That ends, one way or another."

> "I was there when the Castellan earned his scar. He bled for this realm. I'll bleed for him if I must."

## Secrets

1. He knows one of his sergeants is reporting to [[House Thorne]]—and hasn't acted on it yet because the intelligence sometimes flows both ways. It's a dangerous game for a man who hates games.

2. His nephew in the Watch has gotten involved with the Dock Runners smuggling operation. Brennan is torn between family loyalty and his duty—a vulnerability he's never had before.

3. He carries a letter from the late King [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]], to be opened only if the Castellan falls. He's never read it, but its existence haunts him.

### Portrait (Bust)
**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a human military commander, male, fifty-four years old with the build of an ox barely contained by his armor. A blunt, honest face made for battlefields rather than courts—heavy brow ridge shadowing small, shrewd eyes the color of wet stone, assessing everything with the automatic threat-evaluation of a career soldier. A twice-broken nose sits crooked above a firm mouth set in neither smile nor frown, just the neutral expression of a man who has no patience for pretense. A massive scar runs from his forehead through his left eyebrow and down his cheek, the skin puckered and white, a souvenir from the Battle of Ashen Fields where he earned his commission—he wears it without vanity or shame. Iron-grey hair cropped military-short, receding from a weathered forehead, the temples gone silver while the rest holds stubbornly dark. A neck like a tree trunk, shoulders broad enough to fill a doorway, the physicality of a man who has trained every day for forty years and hasn't stopped because stopping is dying. Clean-shaven, the discipline of decades making it automatic. Wearing the black plate armor of the Crown Guard, functional rather than ceremonial, dented and scratched from actual use, the crown-and-tower emblem worked in silver on the breastplate. Expression of controlled vigilance, the look of a man who sees threats before they materialize and ends them before they spread. Hands visible in steel gauntlets, one resting on the pommel of his bastard sword with the ease of thirty years' familiarity. Background: the battlements of Eldoria's palace, the city spread below, the weight of its protection visible in the set of his jaw. Harsh afternoon light, practical and unforgiving, the light of a soldier who has no use for shadows or subtlety. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on battle-worn armor and weathered soldier's face, dramatic atmosphere of duty and danger, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy military commander portrait illustration.

## Notes
Commander Steel serves as the "reliable soldier" archetype—someone players can trust absolutely in a world of shifting loyalties. His simplicity is his strength, but also his limitation. He's best used as a source of military quests, combat backup, and a moral anchor when everything else is compromised.
