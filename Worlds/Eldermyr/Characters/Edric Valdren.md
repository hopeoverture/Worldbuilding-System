# Edric Valdren

## Overview
Edric Valdren is the fifteen-year-old heir to the throne of Eldermyr, son of the late [[High King Aldric II|King Aldric]] II, and grandson of the man who secretly murdered his father. Everyone assumes he's a puppet—his grandfather's tool, too young and naive to rule. They're wrong. Edric watches, listens, and waits. He knows something is deeply wrong with his regency. He just doesn't know yet how deep the rot goes.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human
- **Age:** 15, on the cusp of manhood; some boyish softness still in his features
- **Height/Build:** 5'6" and still growing; lean and athletic from sword training; will be tall like his father
- **Skin/Eyes:** Fair complexion from his mother's Valdren blood; striking blue eyes (his father's) that seem older than his years
- **Hair:** Dark brown, kept short as befits a young lord; tends to fall across his forehead when he's focused
- **Distinguishing Features:** Slight cleft in his chin (his father's); hands already calloused from sword practice; often has ink stains on his fingers from secret reading

### Attire
- **Typical Dress:** Royal blue and gold (Valdren colors he's learned to resent); finery appropriate to his station
- **When Training:** Simple sparring clothes; prefers practical dress when he can escape formal duties
- **Signature Item:** A plain iron ring that was his father's—not valuable, but the only thing of [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]'s he was allowed to keep

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Observant Silence:** Speaks rarely in council, but notices everything; catalogues expressions, alliances, and slips of the tongue
2. **Hidden Stubbornness:** Appears compliant and obedient while internally refusing to accept his controlled fate

### Ideals
**Justice.** My father is dead and someone is responsible. The realm is broken and someone must fix it. I will not be a puppet king who ignores suffering because it's convenient.

### Bonds
His father's memory drives him. Edric barely knew [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]—the king was distant, focused on ruling—but he reveres what his father represented: a just ruler who maintained peace. He will be worthy of that legacy.

### Flaws
**Isolation.** Edric trusts no one fully. His grandfather controls his household; [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] wants to control his crown; the noble houses see him as a tool. He has no true friends, and his inability to trust may prevent him from finding allies when he desperately needs them.

### Motivations
Edric wants three things: to understand why everyone treats his regency as permanent, to discover the truth about his father's death (he suspects it wasn't natural), and to become a king worthy of the crown—not a puppet, but a true ruler who protects his people.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Noble (Royal Blood)

**Early Life:** Born to [[High King Aldric II|King Aldric]] II and Lady Serana Valdren, Edric grew up in [[Aldersgate]]'s royal palace. His childhood was comfortable but distant—his father was always ruling, his mother always deferring to her father, and his grandfather always watching. He was seven when the king died.

### Formative Events
1. **The King's Death:** At seven, Edric was told his father died in his sleep. He remembers the funeral, his mother's tears, and his grandfather's steady hand on his shoulder. He didn't understand then that the hand was a leash.

2. **The Delayed Coronation:** At ten, he was supposed to be crowned. His grandfather explained why it couldn't happen—the realm wasn't stable, he was too young, it would come soon. It's been five years of "soon."

3. **The Overheard Conversation:** At fourteen, Edric overheard his grandfather dismiss him as "manageable." That was the moment he stopped being obedient and started being strategic.

### Current Situation
Edric lives in the royal palace but has no real power. His grandfather approves his tutors, his guards, and his schedule. He attends councils where he's patted on the head and ignored. He's forbidden from visiting [[The Eastern March]] or [[The Karath Reach]]. Something is being hidden from him, and he's determined to find out what.

## Secrets

1. **He knows something is wrong.** The delay in his coronation, his grandfather's control, the way people look at him—Edric has pieced together that he's being used. He just doesn't know exactly how.

2. **He's been reading forbidden things.** Edric has bribed a palace servant to smuggle him books his grandfather wouldn't approve—histories of regencies, accounts of [[The Great War|the Great War]], records of his father's reign.

3. **He suspects his father was murdered.** No proof yet, just a gut feeling that a healthy man of forty-five doesn't simply die in his sleep. He's looking for evidence.

4. **He's been training in secret.** His official sword training is supervised and controlled. But he's also been practicing with a retired soldier who owes nothing to [[House Valdren|Valdren]] gold—learning to fight for real, not for show.

5. **He's considered running.** Sometimes he imagines fleeing to [[The Eastern March|the Eastern March]] and throwing himself on [[House Thorne]]'s mercy. [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] hates his grandfather. Maybe she'd help him. But he knows that would make him a different kind of puppet.

| Dagger | +4 | 1d4+2 | Piercing | Finesse, light |

### Combat Style
Edric is trained but untested. He practices diligently and has natural talent, but he's never fought for his life. In a real fight, he would be brave but inexperienced—dangerous in that he might take risks a veteran wouldn't.

## Relationships

### Family
- **Mother:** Lady Serana Valdren — Loves him but is utterly controlled by her father; Edric pities her more than he trusts her
- **Grandfather:** [[Lord Varic Valdren]] — Controller, manipulator, and possibly his father's murderer; Edric fears and resents him
- **Father (deceased):** [[High King Aldric II]] II "[[High King Aldric II]]" — Barely remembered but deeply revered

### Potential Allies
- **[[Lady Margret Thorne]]** — His grandfather's enemy; might help him, but would want something in return
- **[[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]]** — [[The Grey Wardens]] serve the realm, not [[Lord Varic Valdren|the regent]]; might be trustworthy
- **The servants** — Some are loyal to the crown, not to Valdren; Edric is learning to tell the difference

### Enemies
- **[[Lord Varic Valdren]]** — His grandfather loves him but will never let him truly rule
- **Anyone who benefits from the regency** — Half the court

## Story Role

### Function
**Primary Role:** Potential protagonist / political asset / moral center

**Threat Level:** Currently minimal, but growing rapidly

### Arc
Edric's arc is about becoming a true king. He must move from suspicion to knowledge, from isolation to trust, from puppet to player. He might become the realm's salvation—a king who unites the factions against the rising dead—or he might be destroyed by the forces he's too young to handle.

### Possible Outcomes
- **True King:** Breaks free, claims his throne, becomes the leader the realm needs
- **Tragic Victim:** Murdered, exiled, or broken before he can act
- **Pawn Turned Player:** Outmaneuvers his grandfather, but becomes ruthless in the process
- **Catalyst:** His actions spark the civil war, for good or ill

### As an Ally
If the party earns his trust—truly earns it—Edric can provide:
- Access to the palace and its secrets
- Royal legitimacy for their actions
- A future king who owes them
- Information his grandfather doesn't know he has

### As a Quest
The party might be:
- Hired to protect him (by someone who fears for his safety)
- Asked to help him escape (by Edric himself)
- Sent to investigate his father's death (by anyone who wants to destabilize the regency)
- Tasked with teaching him (fighting, magic, the truth)

## Roleplay Notes

### Voice & Mannerisms
- **Voice:** Carefully neutral in public; more animated in private; occasional flashes of his father's authority
- **Mannerisms:** Touches his iron ring when thinking; has learned to keep his face still; forgets himself and smiles when interested in something
- **Tells:** When lying, speaks slightly too formally; when angry, goes very quiet (like his grandfather, though he'd hate to know it)

### Sample Dialogue

> "Of course, Grandfather. Whatever you think is best." *(Said with perfect obedience, eyes cataloguing every reaction in the room.)*

> "My father was a good king. Everyone says so. I want to understand how he ruled—so I can be ready when my time comes."

> "You're the first person who's spoken to me like I'm not a child or a crown. I... appreciate that."

> "I've been 'not ready' for five years. When, exactly, does my grandfather think I'll be ready? When he's dead? Or when I am?"

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Prince's Request:** Edric secretly approaches the party. He needs people who aren't controlled by his grandfather—people who can investigate, spy, or smuggle him information.

2. **The Assassination Attempt:** Someone tries to kill Edric. Who? Why? His grandfather to remove a problem? [[House Thorne]] to eliminate the Valdren claim? [[House Karath]] for revenge?

3. **The Forbidden Knowledge:** Edric has found something in his secret reading—something about the rising dead, or his father's death, or [[The Great War|the Great War]]. He needs help understanding it.

4. **The Escape:** Edric decides to run. He needs escorts, a destination, and a plan. Does the party help the boy king flee—and what happens when [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] discovers the betrayal?
