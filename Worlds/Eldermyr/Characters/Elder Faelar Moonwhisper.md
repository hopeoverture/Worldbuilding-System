# Elder Faelar Moonwhisper

## Overview

Elder Faelar Moonwhisper is the unofficial leader of [[Aldersgate]]'s high elf community, a diplomat and scholar who has watched four centuries of human politics from within the capital's Starlight Quarter. His measured wisdom and deep knowledge of history make him a valuable advisor to those wise enough to seek counsel from the long-lived.

Faelar has lived through the rise and fall of dynasties, the horror of [[The Mad King]]'s reign, and the relative peace of [[High King Aldric II]]'s rule. Now, as Eldermyr descends into succession crisis, he watches with concern as old patterns repeat—and wonders if this time, the cycle might finally break differently.

## Appearance

Faelar appears as an elf in his middle years by elven standards—neither the bright vitality of youth nor the ethereal translucence of great age. His silver hair flows past his shoulders, and his eyes are the pale blue of winter dawn. His features are sharp and composed, betraying little of his thoughts.

He dresses in robes of midnight blue embroidered with silver stars—the traditional garb of high elf elders. A moonstone pendant at his throat marks him as a devotee of the old elven ways, though he shows proper respect to [[The Faith of the Three]] in public.

## Personality

Four centuries have taught Faelar patience and perspective that shorter-lived races struggle to comprehend. He thinks in decades, plans in centuries, and mourns in moments. This long view can make him seem detached from human concerns, but in truth, he cares deeply—he has simply learned that caring too intensely about every crisis leads to madness.

He speaks rarely but precisely, weighing the impact of words that might echo for generations. When he does offer counsel, the wise listen carefully.

## Role in Aldersgate

### Voice of the Elves
The Starlight Quarter's high elf population (~5,000) looks to Faelar for guidance in dealings with human authorities. He negotiates their rights, mediates disputes, and represents elven interests at court when invited.

### Keeper of Long Memory
Faelar remembers events that have passed from human memory into legend. His knowledge of history—the true history, not the sanitized versions—makes him invaluable to scholars and dangerous to those with secrets to hide.

### Bridge Between Peoples
Faelar maintains connections with both the [[Elves|wood elves]] of [[Myrkvid]] and the scattered high elf communities across Eldermyr. He serves as intermediary between elven and human worlds.

## Knowledge and Concerns

### The Old Magic
Faelar understands forms of magic that have been forgotten or suppressed by human wizards. He recognizes the signs of the curse spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]] as something ancient and terrible—something that the current generation's mages are unprepared to face.

### The Corrupted Grove
Faelar knows of [[The Greenward]] and its transformation. He remembers when it was a place of harmony, and he grieves for what Thornweep has become. He believes the dryad might be saved, if approached with understanding rather than violence.

### The Coming Storm
His long perspective shows Faelar patterns that shorter-lived races miss. The succession crisis is dangerous, yes—but the true threat is what's stirring in the south. The dead rising, ancient evils awakening, the land itself sickening. Faelar fears that by the time humans notice the real danger, it may be too late.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Long View:** Faelar summons adventurers to share what his centuries of observation have revealed about the current crisis. The information is valuable—but his price is a favor to be named later.

2. **The Corrupted Grove:** Faelar asks for help saving [[The Greenward]] and Thornweep, offering knowledge of druidic magic and dryad psychology that might make redemption possible.

3. **Elven Archives:** The Starlight Quarter holds records that human authorities would prefer forgotten. Faelar might grant access—if the cause is worthy.
