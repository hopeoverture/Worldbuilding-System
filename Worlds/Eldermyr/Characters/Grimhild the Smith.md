# Grimhild the Smith

## Overview
Grimhild the Smith is the legendary Guildmaster of the Forgemasters Guild and the greatest smith in living memory. Her weapons never break. Her armor has turned dragon fire. At seventy-two, she has trained three generations of smiths and armed the Eastern March's armies for half a century. She is also secretly forging something unprecedented—a weapon that might unite the realm or destroy it—and she needs materials that don't exist in Eldermyr.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human
- **Age:** 72, and looks it—but built like iron
- **Height/Build:** 5'2", compact and massively muscled; arms like tree trunks; hands that have shaped metal for sixty years
- **Skin/Eyes:** Weathered and scarred from forge work; small, sharp eyes the color of heated steel
- **Hair:** Iron-gray, worn short and practical; usually has metal filings in it
- **Distinguishing Features:** Burn scars across her forearms (badges of honor); permanently calloused hands; moves with the deliberate precision of someone who respects the weight of things

### Attire
- **Working:** Heavy leather apron, simple clothes, always has forge tools within reach
- **Formal:** The same, with the Guildmaster's chain (links of different metals she forged herself)
- **Never:** Anything impractical; she hasn't worn a dress in forty years

### Presence
Grimhild's presence is the warmth of a forge—intense, purposeful, and not to be trifled with. People instinctively straighten up around her. Nobles who forget she's not one of them quickly remember when she looks at them with those forge-fire eyes.

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Forge Philosophy:** Everything worth having is worked for; nothing good comes easy; you are what you make
2. **Blunt Truth:** Says exactly what she means; considers flattery a waste of time; respects those who can take criticism

### Ideals
**Craft.** A smith makes things that last. A good smith makes things that matter. The blades I forge will be swinging long after I'm ash. That's immortality enough for anyone.

### Bonds
The Guild is her legacy, but her true pride is her students. She's trained smiths who've trained smiths. Her techniques, her philosophy, her standards—they'll outlive her by centuries.

### Flaws
**Stubbornness.** Grimhild's certainty can become rigidity. Once she decides something, changing her mind requires moving mountains. This has cost her relationships and occasionally leads her to ignore valid alternatives.

### Motivations
Grimhild wants to forge one last masterwork—something that will make everything else she's made look like practice. She believes the realm is heading for a crisis that requires a weapon unlike anything that's existed. She's been working on it for three years. She needs materials from beyond the Ostmark Pass.

## Background

### The Apprentice
Grimhild was apprenticed at twelve, became a journeywoman at eighteen, and was acknowledged as a master by twenty-five. She was the first woman to achieve master rank in the Guild's history. She didn't ask for acceptance; she simply outworked everyone.

### Rise to Guildmaster
Grimhild became Guildmaster forty years ago after her predecessor died (in her forge, working, as she approved). She's refused to step down despite her age because she sees no one ready to replace her. Her standards are exacting; few measure up.

### The Secret Commission
Three years ago, Grimhild began work on something unprecedented. She's told no one the full truth—only that she needs materials that don't exist in Eldermyr. She's asked Konrad Thorne to help arrange an expedition beyond the Ostmark Pass.

- **Hit Points:** 128
- **Resistances:** Fire (decades of forge work)

### Senses
- **Passive Perception:** 18
- **Special:** Can identify any metal by touch; knows the make and quality of any weapon at a glance

### Languages
Common, Dwarvish (learned from dwarven smiths), some Elvish (studied elven metallurgy texts)

## Abilities

### Legendary Smith
Grimhild can craft items of exceptional quality:
- Weapons she forges have +1 to attack and damage minimum
- Armor she forges grants +1 AC minimum
- Her masterwork items (rare) can reach +2 or +3
- Items she forges never break under normal use

### Knowledge of the Forge
Grimhild knows ancient smithing techniques passed down through the Guild:
- Cold iron working (effective against fey and certain spirits)
- Silver inlay (effective against undead and lycanthropes)
- Pattern welding (creates flexible yet strong blades)
- Rumored: techniques that border on magic

### The Unfinished Blade
In her private forge, Grimhild is working on something she calls "the Unfinished Blade." It requires materials from beyond the Pass—metals that don't exist in Eldermyr. She believes it will be her masterwork.

## Combat

### Attacks
| Name | Attack Bonus | Damage | Type | Properties |
|------|--------------|--------|------|------------|
| Forge Hammer | +8 | 1d10+3 | Bludgeoning | Heavy, can shape metal |
| Her Own Sword | +8 | 1d8+3 | Slashing | +2, never breaks |

### Combat Role
Grimhild is not a warrior—but she's spent sixty years swinging heavy hammers, and she knows how metal bites flesh. She would fight to defend her forge, her Guild, or her students. She would win.

## Equipment

### Personal Forge
Grimhild's forge in Hammerhall is legendary. The fires burn hotter, the anvil is ancient beyond reckoning, and the tools have been refined for centuries. Weapons made here are simply better.

### The Guildmaster's Hammer
A warhammer she forged when she became Guildmaster. It can shape metal at room temperature with enough strikes—a technique no one else has replicated.

### The Unfinished Blade
Work in progress. Currently exists as a tang, a partial blade, and a vision. Requires starfall iron, orichalcum, and something else she hasn't named.

## Relationships

### The Guild
- **[[Ser Konrad Thorne]]** — The March lord who understands craft; she respects him
- **The Masters** — Her council; she's trained most of them
- **Apprentices** — She still teaches, though rarely; it's considered a great honor

### With Power
- **[[Lady Margret Thorne]]** — Respects the Iron Lady; would support a Thorne king
- **[[House Valdren]]** — Distrusts merchants on principle; they see value, not craft
- **Everyone Else** — Largely indifferent to politics; cares about the work

### The Commission
Only Grimhild knows the full truth about what she's forging. She's told Konrad she needs materials from beyond the Pass. She hasn't told him why.

## Story Role

### Function
**Primary:** Legendary craftsperson, potential source of powerful equipment, holder of ancient secrets

**As an Ally:** Can forge equipment of exceptional quality; may share smithing secrets
**As Quest-Giver:** Needs materials from beyond the Pass for her secret project

### Arc
Grimhild must decide what her masterwork is for. A weapon that could unite the realm—or destroy it. Her arc is about legacy: what does she leave behind?

## Secrets

1. **The Unfinished Blade is meant to kill something immortal.** Grimhild has been having dreams—sent by who, she doesn't know—showing her what's coming. She's forging a weapon to fight it.

2. **She knows ancient techniques that border on magic.** The line between masterwork smithing and enchantment is thin. Grimhild walks it carefully.

3. **She's worried about succession.** None of her masters meet her standards. If she dies before finishing her work and training a successor, the Guild's secrets may be lost.

4. **War is profitable, but she hates it.** The succession crisis is good for Guild business. Grimhild takes the money and despises herself for it.
