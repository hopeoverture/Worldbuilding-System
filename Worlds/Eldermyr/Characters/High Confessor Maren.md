# High Confessor Maren

## Overview
High Confessor Maren is the supreme leader of [[The Faith of the Three]] and the most powerful religious figure in Eldermyr. Once a humble scholar, he rose through the ranks through piety, political skill, and genuine devotion. But two years ago, the visions began—terrible, beautiful, demanding visions that he believes come from [[The Faith of the Three]] themselves. They tell him he is chosen to guide the realm through its greatest crisis. They tell him the dead rise because the realm has strayed. They tell him he must seize [[Magic of Eldermyr]] to save it. He believes every word. He is wrong about the source.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human
- **Age:** 67, well-preserved; looks perhaps fifty-five
- **Height/Build:** 5'7", thin but not frail; carries himself with absolute certainty
- **Skin/Eyes:** Pale from years indoors with books; once-brown eyes have developed an unsettling golden ring around the iris (he believes this is a mark of divine favor)
- **Hair:** White, worn in a simple tonsure; short beard trimmed precisely
- **Distinguishing Features:** Hands that gesture constantly when preaching; eyes that seem to look through rather than at people; rarely blinks

### Attire
- **Holy Vestments:** White and silver robes of the High Confessor; the triple symbols of [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] (crown and scales, open hands, veiled figure with book)
- **Ceremonial:** In formal settings, wears the ancient mitre and carries [[The Shepherd's Crook|the Shepherd's Staff]]
- **Practical:** Even in private, dresses in simple white; sees himself as a servant, not a lord

### Presence
Maren's presence is magnetic. When he speaks, people listen—not because of volume, but because of absolute conviction. He radiates certainty the way a fire radiates heat. The faithful feel comforted in his presence; the doubting feel judged. Those with divine sensitivity feel something else entirely: something is feeding him power, but it is not [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]].

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Absolute Conviction:** Speaks and acts with the certainty of someone who knows they are right; genuinely believes he has been chosen
2. **Pastoral Manipulation:** Uses the language of care and concern to control; frames every power grab as sacrifice for the greater good

### Ideals
**Divine Mandate.** [[The Faith of the Three|The Three]] have chosen me to guide the realm through its hour of darkness. The dead rise because the realm has strayed—because power is held by merchants and soldiers instead of the faithful. I will restore the proper order. This is not ambition; this is duty.

### Bonds
[[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] is everything. Maren has no family, no personal attachments, no interests beyond the spiritual. The Church is his family, his purpose, his life. He would die for it—and he would kill for it.

### Flaws
**Messianic Delusion.** Maren cannot accept that his visions might be false or corrupted. To doubt them would be to doubt everything he is. If confronted with proof that something else speaks to him, he would more likely declare the proof false than accept the truth.

### Motivations
Maren wants to save the realm. He believes—truly believes—that the succession crisis, the rising dead, and the realm's suffering are divine punishment for straying from [[The Faith of the Three]]. He believes [[The Faith of the Three]] have chosen him to fix this. He believes [[The Faith of the Three]] must seize temporal power to restore spiritual order. Every action he takes flows from this conviction—including the ones that will doom thousands.

## Villainy

### The Visions
Two years ago, Maren began receiving visions during prayer. At first they were comforting—reassurances that his faith was true. Then they became demanding. They showed him the realm's corruption, the coming darkness, the necessity of action. They told him he was chosen.

The visions are real. They do not come from [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]].

Something—perhaps [[The Unnamed]], perhaps something else—has found a way to speak through Maren's devotion. It feeds him true prophecy mixed with poison. It guides him toward actions that will weaken the realm and strengthen darkness. Maren believes he serves the light. He is becoming an instrument of something else entirely.

### Methods
- **Sermons and Prophecy:** Uses his visions to guide doctrine; has declared the rising dead a punishment for the realm's sins
- **Political Pressure:** Demands [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s right to approve the next king; blocks Valdren's regency at every turn
- **Holy Tribunals:** Has begun investigating "impiety" among the nobility; witch-hunt waiting to happen
- **The Faithful Militia:** Building an armed force under Church authority, "to protect pilgrims and holy sites"

### Crimes (Intentions)
Maren has not yet committed true atrocities—but he's moving toward them:
1. **Plans to declare the regency illegitimate** — Would trigger civil war
2. **Preparing to seize temporal power** — Faith as government
3. **Suppressing the truth about the rising dead** — Sees it as divine judgment, not enemy action
4. **Will authorize violence** — When the visions demand it

### Justification
"I take no pleasure in this. Power is a burden, not a gift. But [[The Faith of the Three]] have shown me what must be done. The realm is sick—consumed by greed, faithlessness, and division. The dead rise because we have forsaken the covenant. I alone have been given the vision to see the path forward. If I must take up temporal authority to heal the realm's spirit, then that is my cross to bear. History will understand. [[The Faith of the Three]] will understand. I am their instrument."

### Ultimate Goal
A realm united under [[The Faith of the Three]], with the High Confessor as its spiritual and temporal guide. He envisions a theocracy where [[The Faith of the Three]]'s law is the only law. He believes this will bring peace, order, and salvation.

What he will actually bring is chaos, suffering, and an open door for darker powers.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Acolyte (Scholar-Priest)

**Early Life:** Born to a minor noble family, Maren entered the Church at twelve after a childhood illness. He was pious, brilliant, and ambitious in the way of scholars—wanting to know more, understand more, serve more. He rose through the ranks as a theologian, diplomat, and administrator.

### Rise to High Confessor
Maren became High Confessor fifteen years ago, succeeding an elderly predecessor. He was a consensus choice—acceptable to all factions, threatening to none. For thirteen years he led [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] competently but unremarkably. He was respected but not feared, powerful but not dominant.

Then the visions began.

### The Transformation
Two years ago, during a night vigil in the [[Thornhall]] cathedral, Maren had his first vision. [[The Faith of the Three|The Three]] (or so he believed) spoke to him directly. They showed him the realm's future—war, death, and darkness. They showed him that he was chosen to prevent it. They demanded he act.

Since then, Maren has become more assertive, more certain, more political. The other bishops are uncomfortable but cannot challenge him—his visions have been accurate enough to seem genuine. The golden ring in his eyes appeared six months ago. He takes it as confirmation of his selection. He is wrong.

### Current Status
Maren operates from [[Thornhall]] of [[Thornhall]], directing [[The Faith of the Three]]'s response to the succession crisis. He blocks Valdren at every turn, demands [[The Faith of the Three]]'s right to approve the king, and prepares for the day when he must take more direct action. The visions are becoming more frequent, more demanding. Something is rushing him toward a confrontation he doesn't fully understand.

## Minions & Allies

### Lieutenants
1. **Bishop Aldous the Stern** — Leads [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s investigative arm; true believer in Maren's visions
2. **Mother Superior Elara** — Commands the sisters' orders; has doubts but remains loyal
3. **Father Cristobal** — Former soldier, now leads the Faithful Militia; devoted to Maren personally

### Forces
- **The Synod:** Council of bishops, mostly loyal or cowed
- **Temple Knights:** ~500 armed warriors sworn to [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]
- **The Faithful Militia:** ~2,000 and growing; peasants and believers armed "for defense"
- **The Priesthood:** Thousands of clergy throughout the realm

### The Source of the Visions
Maren doesn't know what truly speaks to him. It may be:
- [[The Unnamed]], working through an unexpected channel
- A demon posing as divine
- Something from beyond the world entirely
- (Possibly) actual corrupted divine power, [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]'s will twisted by the crisis

Whatever it is, it is patient. It needs Maren to believe.

## Relationships

### Within [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]
- **The Synod:** Most bishops support him; some have private doubts
- **[[The Grey Wardens]]:** Ostensibly under Faith authority; [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane|Greymane]] is increasingly frustrated with Maren's obstruction
- **The Temple Knights:** Loyal to the High Confessor; would follow him into battle

### With Secular Powers
- **[[Lord Varic Valdren]]** — Bitter opposition; Maren sees him as everything wrong with the realm
- **[[Lady Margret Thorne]]** — Grudging respect; she's a soldier of faith, at least; potentially manipulable
- **[[Lord Draven Karath]]** — Suspicious; the rising dead in his lands feels like judgment, but something else too
- **[[Edric Valdren]]** — The boy is not his grandfather; might be redeemable under proper spiritual guidance

### The Divine
Maren prays to [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] constantly. He receives visions he believes are answers. He is slowly becoming an instrument for something else—and may take the entire Faith with him.

## Story Role

### Threat Level
**Regional** — Maren's actions could trigger civil war and/or undermine resistance to the rising dead

### Arc
Maren's arc is about the danger of certainty. He is not evil—he genuinely believes he serves [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] and the realm's good. But his conviction has made him blind to doubt, and something is exploiting that blindness. His tragedy is that his greatest strength—his faith—has become his greatest vulnerability.

### Possible Outcomes
- **Redemption:** Confronted with undeniable proof, realizes he's been deceived; sacrifices himself to undo the damage
- **Destruction:** Killed or removed before he can cause catastrophe; [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] splinters
- **Victory (Dark):** Seizes power, establishes theocracy, becomes a puppet for darker forces
- **Confrontation:** Must face the true source of his visions and choose between faith and truth

### As an Ally (Conditional)
If somehow convinced his visions are false, or if convinced the party serves divine purpose, Maren could provide:
- [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]]'s resources and legitimacy
- Powerful divine magic
- Access to religious archives and knowledge
- A reformation of the Church

### As an Enemy
If the party opposes him:
- Declared heretics and enemies of [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]
- Hunted by Temple Knights and the Faithful Militia
- Divine magic turned against them
- The entire religious establishment as opposition

## Tactics

### Political Strategy
Maren prefers to work through institutions—sermons, decrees, councils. He builds consensus through faith and pressure. Violence is a last resort (for now).

### Combat Strategy
If forced to fight:
1. Casts Spirit Guardians immediately
2. Uses Spiritual Weapon for ongoing damage
3. Debuffs enemies with Hold Person, Command, or Silence
4. If threatened, casts Banishment on the greatest threat
5. Will not flee—he is chosen; he cannot fail

### Psychological Approach
- Speaks with absolute conviction
- Frames opposition as opposition to the gods
- Offers redemption to those who submit
- Shows genuine sadness when forced to harm

## Secrets

1. **The visions are not from [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]].** Something else speaks to Maren—something that knows exactly what he wants to hear and uses truth to hide its lies.

2. **The golden ring in his eyes is a mark of corruption.** It appeared six months ago and is slowly growing. By the time it covers his entire iris, the transformation will be complete.

3. **He has suppressed reports about [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]].** [[The Grey Wardens]]' reports suggest something beyond divine judgment. Maren has buried these reports because they don't fit his narrative.

4. **Deep down, he doubts.** In his darkest moments, Maren wonders if his certainty is a gift or a curse. He suppresses these doubts with prayer—and the visions always reassure him.

5. **There is still time.** The corruption is not complete. If Maren were confronted with undeniable truth about the source of his visions, he might still be saved. But every day, the window closes a little more.

### Portrait (Bust)
**Prompt:**
> Portrait bust of an elderly human high priest, male, sixty-seven years old but appearing perhaps fifty-five—well-preserved by conviction rather than magic. Long narrow face with refined aristocratic features that speak of minor nobility. High domed forehead, pale and smooth, white hair worn in a simple tonsure that frames his skull like a halo; he has kept this humble cut even as he rose to power. Thin elegant white eyebrows, perpetually raised as if in gentle question or patient instruction. Deep-set brown eyes with an unsettling golden ring around each iris—a mark he believes shows divine favor, growing slowly brighter over two years; the eyes rarely blink, seeming to look through rather than at the viewer, seeing something beyond mortal sight. Long straight nose, thin and refined, slightly pinched at the bridge as if from decades of contemplative frowning. Hollow cheekbones, ascetic and severe, the face of a man who fasts often and takes no pleasure in food. Thin bloodless lips hidden beneath a short trimmed white beard kept precisely groomed—a small vanity he permits himself; the lips often move silently in prayer even during conversation. Narrow pointed chin beneath the beard, weak but stubborn, the chin of a man who has never wielded a sword but wields something more dangerous: certainty. Pale indoor complexion, the pallor of someone who has spent decades in libraries and cathedrals rather than sunlight; a subtle unhealthy undertone developing as the visions grow stronger. Hands visible, long-fingered and elegant, constantly gesturing as he speaks, blessing and condemning with the same graceful movements. Expression of absolute conviction and divine purpose, gaze magnetic and unnerving—the face of a man who believes he speaks for gods and cannot conceive he might be wrong. Wearing white and silver robes with the triple symbols of the Three (crown and scales, open hands, veiled figure with book). Background: blurred cathedral interior with stained glass hints. Warm candlelight with subtle golden highlights gathering around his eyes. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on ascetic features, golden-rimmed corruption, and the dangerous beauty of absolute faith, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy corrupt prophet portrait.

### Full Body
**Prompt:**
> Full body portrait of an elderly human high priest, sixty-seven years old, thin but carrying himself with absolute certainty. White tonsured hair, trimmed white beard, pale complexion, brown eyes with golden ring around iris. Wearing elaborate white and silver High Confessor vestments, ancient mitre, carrying the Shepherd's Staff topped with triple symbols of the Three. Standing before the altar of a great cathedral, arms slightly raised as if mid-sermon. Stained glass casts colored light around him. Expression is one of divine conviction and pastoral command. The atmosphere is one of holy power tinged with something subtly wrong. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, fabric, metal, and religious iconography, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy corrupt prophet illustration.
