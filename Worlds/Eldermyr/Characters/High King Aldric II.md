# High King Aldric II

## Overview
High King Aldric II, known as "The Steward," ruled Eldermyr for twenty-three years following [[The Great War]]. The younger son of [[The Mad King|Valdus I]], he was neither warrior nor tyrant—he was the quiet prince who survived while his elder brother [[Prince Edric the Liberator|Prince Edric]] died killing their father. He maintained peace, rebuilt the realm, and held the fractious houses together through diplomacy and carefully measured justice. His death three months ago triggered the succession crisis that now threatens to tear Eldermyr apart.

## History

### Before the Crown
Aldric was the second son of [[The Mad King|Valdus I]]—the quiet one, the scholar, the one nobody watched. While his elder brother [[Prince Edric the Liberator|Prince Edric]] rebelled against their father, Aldric kept his head down and survived. During [[The Great War|the Great War]], he managed logistics and supplies for the rebel forces—vital work, but not glorious. He was known for being competent, honest, and utterly lacking in the ambition that had destroyed his father.

### The Acclamation
When [[Prince Edric the Liberator]] died at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], the realm needed a new king. Aldric was the only surviving son of [[The Mad King]]—but unlike his father, he had fought against the tyranny. Lord Edmund Thorne and Lord Marcus Valdren could have contested the crown, but neither wanted another civil war. Aldric represented continuity without madness, royal blood without corruption. He was crowned reluctantly by all parties, including himself.

### The Reign
For twenty-three years, Aldric did exactly what was needed: nothing dramatic. He maintained peace between the houses. He rebuilt the war-torn regions (except [[The Karath Reach|the Karath Reach]], which he could not save). He had one daughter, Princess Elara, whom he married to [[Lord Varic Valdren]]'s eldest son, Lord Cassian Valdren—binding the royal line to the wealthy western house. He created the network of marriages and alliances that should have ensured stability.

### The Death
Three months ago, Aldric died in his sleep. He had been in declining health for years. But the realm whispers of poison—administered by whom depends on who is whispering. The truth may be simpler: he was old, tired, and ready.

## The Succession Crisis

### The Problem
Aldric outlived his daughter. Princess Elara died in childbirth bringing [[Edric Valdren]] into the world. Her husband Lord Cassian Valdren died a few years later in a riding accident—or so it was ruled. The only direct blood heir is Aldric's grandson [[Edric Valdren]], now fifteen years old, raised by his paternal grandfather [[Lord Varic Valdren]].

### The Claimants
- **[[Edric Valdren]]:** Blood heir, but a child. His grandfather [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] Valdren rules as regent.
- **[[Lady Margret Thorne]]:** Claims the crown should go to the strongest, not a child.
- **[[Lord Draven Karath]]:** Claims [[House Karath|the Karaths]] were wrongly stripped of the crown.
- **[[High Confessor Maren]]:** Claims divine mandate to choose the next ruler.

### Aldric's Failure
Aldric knew this crisis was coming. He tried to prepare: grooming [[Edric Valdren|Edric]], balancing the houses, seeking peace. But he could not solve the fundamental problem—no clear adult heir of his blood. His death was the spark that ignited the kindling.

## Personality

### The Reluctant King
Aldric never wanted the crown. He took it because no one else could, and he wore it like a burden. He found no joy in power, only responsibility. This made him a good king—he never abused his position—but a lonely one.

### The Peacemaker
Aldric's greatest skill was finding compromise. He could make rivals feel heard, find middle ground in disputes, and defuse tensions before they exploded. Without him, the tensions he managed now run wild.

### The Tired Man
In his final years, Aldric was exhausted. He saw the storm coming—the houses circling, the curse spreading, the succession unsolved—and he couldn't stop it. He died hoping someone else could save what he had built.

## Legacy

### Political
Aldric's neutrality maintained peace but prevented resolution. By refusing to favor any house, he ensured none could dominate—but also ensured none would back down when he was gone. His peace was a pause, not a solution.

### Personal
Aldric was respected but not loved. The houses appreciate what he did for them, but none will defend his memory if it conflicts with their interests. His grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] might, but [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] is a child.

### [[The Iron Crown]]
Aldric wore [[The Iron Crown|the Iron Crown]] faithfully. It accepted him as a legitimate ruler, if not a great one. His connection to it was steady but never strong. Some say the Crown is waiting for someone with greater fire.

## Secrets

1. **He Knew About the Curse.** Aldric received reports about [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] throughout his reign. He suppressed them, hoping the problem would resolve itself or at least outlast him. It did neither.

2. **The Poisoning Is Real.** Aldric was poisoned—but he knew about it. He chose to drink the wine anyway. He was tired of waiting for the knife in the dark. Let it be quick, he thought. Let the next generation fight.

3. **He Wrote Letters.** Aldric left sealed letters for each major faction leader, to be opened after his death. Each letter contains advice specific to that leader—and a warning about what will happen if they cannot compromise. No one has opened theirs yet.

### Character Portrait
**Prompt:**
> Portrait of an elderly king in his early sixties, male, the reluctant ruler who held a realm together through compromise. Long oval face, careworn and lined with twenty-three years of responsibility he never wanted. High forehead with deep horizontal worry lines and receding silver hairline. Thin gray eyebrows, slightly drooping at the outer edges, giving him a perpetually concerned look. Deep-set gray-blue eyes beneath heavy lids—tired but intelligent, the eyes of a man who has seen too much compromise and knows more is coming; dark circles beneath them speak of sleepless nights. Long straight nose, unremarkable but dignified. Hollow cheeks with deep nasolabial folds from forced diplomatic smiles. Thin pale lips, often pressed together in thought, surrounded by a neatly trimmed silver beard that fails to hide the weakness in his chin—a soft rounded chin that was never meant for the crown's weight. Pale complexion with age spots on his temples, the indoor pallor of a man who spent his reign in council chambers rather than battlefields. Silver hair, once brown, still thick but receding, neatly combed but not vain. The Iron Crown of Eldermyr—a circlet of dark cold iron bound by three silver bands—sits heavy on his brow, seeming to press down on him physically. Wearing simple but fine clothing in muted grays and deep blue rather than ostentatious royal finery. Expression of weary resignation mixed with quiet dignity—a good man exhausted by being adequate when greatness was needed. Seated in a carved wooden chair by a window overlooking a lake, parchment and quill on the table beside him. Warm afternoon light casting long shadows across his lined face.

### Character in Context
**Prompt:**
> High King Aldric II standing alone in the great hall of Aldersgate, dwarfed by the massive iron throne behind him that he rarely sits in. An aging man in his early sixties with a long careworn face—high worried forehead, thin drooping eyebrows, deep-set tired gray-blue eyes with dark circles, long straight nose, hollow cheeks, thin lips in a silver beard, weak rounded chin. Pale complexion with age spots, silver receding hair neatly combed. The Iron Crown weighs visibly on his brow. Average height and slight build—he was never a warrior, only a compromise candidate who became a caretaker king. Dressed in practical dark clothing with minimal ornamentation, a diplomat's careful bearing in every measured movement. The hall is empty of courtiers—he prefers the quiet hours when he doesn't have to pretend strength he doesn't feel. Shafts of evening light stream through tall windows, illuminating dust motes in the air, catching the silver in his beard. His reflection visible in the polished floor, showing a man who looks smaller than his title suggests. Maps and documents scattered on a nearby table showing the fractious realm he holds together through compromise alone—the realms of Thorne, Valdren, and Karath marked with different colors, the borders between them like fault lines. The atmosphere of lonely burden and fading hope.
