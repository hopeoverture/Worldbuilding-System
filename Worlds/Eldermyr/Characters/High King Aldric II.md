# High King Aldric II

## Overview
High King Aldric II, known as "The Steward," ruled Eldermyr for twenty-three years following the Great War. He was not a hero—he was not at the Battle of Ashen Fields—but he was the compromise candidate that all factions could accept. He maintained peace, rebuilt the realm, and held the fractious houses together through diplomacy and neutrality. His death three months ago triggered the succession crisis that now threatens to tear Eldermyr apart.

## History

### Before the Crown
Aldric was a minor lord, cousin to Lord Edmund Thorne but not in the direct line of succession. During the Great War, he managed logistics and supplies—vital work, but not glorious. He was known for being competent, honest, and utterly lacking in ambition.

### The Acclamation
When Prince Edric died at the Ashen Fields, the realm needed a new king. Lord Edmund Thorne could have claimed the crown, but his house was too powerful—the others would never accept it. Lord Marcus Valdren was wealthy but had lost his son. The Karaths were defeated. Aldric was proposed as a compromise: acceptable to all because threatening to none.

### The Reign
For twenty-three years, Aldric did exactly what was needed: nothing dramatic. He maintained peace between the houses. He rebuilt the war-torn regions (except the Karath Reach, which he could not save). He married strategically—his daughter to Lord Edmund Thorne's heir, his son to a Valdren cousin. He created the network of marriages and alliances that should have ensured stability.

### The Death
Three months ago, Aldric died in his sleep. He had been in declining health for years. But the realm whispers of poison—administered by whom depends on who is whispering. The truth may be simpler: he was old, tired, and ready.

## The Succession Crisis

### The Problem
Aldric outlived his children. His daughter (Edmund Thorne's wife) died in childbirth. His son died of illness before producing heirs. The only direct blood heir is his grandson Edric Valdren—born of his daughter's daughter's marriage to Lord Marcus Valdren's grandson. Edric is eleven years old.

### The Claimants
- **Edric Valdren:** Blood heir, but a child. His grandfather Varic Valdren rules as regent.
- **Lady Margret Thorne:** Claims the crown should go to the strongest, not a child.
- **Lord Draven Karath:** Claims the Karaths were wrongly stripped of the crown.
- **High Confessor Maren:** Claims divine mandate to choose the next ruler.

### Aldric's Failure
Aldric knew this crisis was coming. He tried to prepare: grooming Edric, balancing the houses, seeking peace. But he could not solve the fundamental problem—no clear adult heir of his blood. His death was the spark that ignited the kindling.

## Personality

### The Reluctant King
Aldric never wanted the crown. He took it because no one else could, and he wore it like a burden. He found no joy in power, only responsibility. This made him a good king—he never abused his position—but a lonely one.

### The Peacemaker
Aldric's greatest skill was finding compromise. He could make rivals feel heard, find middle ground in disputes, and defuse tensions before they exploded. Without him, the tensions he managed now run wild.

### The Tired Man
In his final years, Aldric was exhausted. He saw the storm coming—the houses circling, the curse spreading, the succession unsolved—and he couldn't stop it. He died hoping someone else could save what he had built.

## Legacy

### Political
Aldric's neutrality maintained peace but prevented resolution. By refusing to favor any house, he ensured none could dominate—but also ensured none would back down when he was gone. His peace was a pause, not a solution.

### Personal
Aldric was respected but not loved. The houses appreciate what he did for them, but none will defend his memory if it conflicts with their interests. His grandson Edric might, but Edric is a child.

### The Iron Crown
Aldric wore the Iron Crown faithfully. It accepted him as a legitimate ruler, if not a great one. His connection to it was steady but never strong. Some say the Crown is waiting for someone with greater fire.

## Secrets

1. **He Knew About the Curse.** Aldric received reports about the Ashen Fields throughout his reign. He suppressed them, hoping the problem would resolve itself or at least outlast him. It did neither.

2. **The Poisoning Is Real.** Aldric was poisoned—but he knew about it. He chose to drink the wine anyway. He was tired of waiting for the knife in the dark. Let it be quick, he thought. Let the next generation fight.

3. **He Wrote Letters.** Aldric left sealed letters for each major faction leader, to be opened after his death. Each letter contains advice specific to that leader—and a warning about what will happen if they cannot compromise. No one has opened theirs yet.
