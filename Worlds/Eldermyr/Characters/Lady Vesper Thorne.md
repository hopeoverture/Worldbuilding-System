# Lady Vesper Thorne

## Overview

Lady Vesper Thorne is officially the reclusive widow of the previous Lord Thorne, a pious woman who retreated from public life after her husband's death and now spends her days in prayer and charitable works. The reality is far darker: Vesper is a vampire who has spent two decades secretly building a network of influence that reaches across Eldermyr.

Her transformation occurred during [[The Great War]], when she was captured by [[House Karath]] forces and subjected to dark rituals. She survived—after a fashion—and returned to [[House Thorne]] with powers and hungers that she has learned to hide with terrifying precision.

## Appearance

In public, Vesper presents herself as a pale, fragile woman who dresses in mourning black and speaks in a soft, pious voice. Her silver-streaked black hair is always covered by a modest veil, and she claims to suffer from a wasting illness that keeps her from sunlight.

In truth, Vesper is a creature of terrible beauty—her skin marble-pale, her eyes holding depths of hunger, her movements fluid as shadow. She feeds carefully, choosing victims who won't be missed, and uses magic to maintain her aging facade during rare public appearances.

## The Hidden Network

### Vampire Spawn
Vesper has created several vampire spawn across Eldermyr, each serving as an extension of her will:
- **Lord Cassian Marwyn** — [[Whitehall Manor]], [[The Crown Lands]]
- **Others unknown** — At least 3-4 more spawn in strategic positions

### Mortal Agents
Beyond her spawn, Vesper commands a network of mortal servants—some charmed, some blackmailed, some simply paid. These agents gather information, eliminate threats, and prepare the way for her larger plans.

### Goals
Vesper's ultimate objective remains unclear, but her actions suggest she is positioning herself to control whoever sits on Eldermyr's throne. Whether she seeks power for its own sake, revenge against [[House Karath]] for what they did to her, or something else entirely, only she knows.

## Relationship with House Thorne

[[Ser Aldric Thorne]] and his son [[Ser Konrad Thorne]] believe their mother/grandmother to be a pious recluse. They visit her rarely—she claims her illness makes company exhausting—and accept her generous "charitable donations" without questioning their source.

If Vesper's true nature were revealed, it would devastate [[House Thorne]]. Their claim to moral superiority over the other houses would collapse. Their standing with [[The Faith of the Three]] would be destroyed. The political implications would be catastrophic.

## The Whitehall Connection

[[Whitehall Manor]]'s Lord Cassian Marwyn is Vesper's most recent spawn, created six months ago during what the young lord believed was a romantic liaison. Vesper chose him for his family's proximity to [[Aldersgate]] and their access to court gossip.

Cassian's deteriorating control troubles Vesper. If he is discovered, the trail could lead back to her. She visits monthly on the new moon to reinforce his obedience and feed—and to decide whether he remains useful enough to preserve.

## Combat Statistics

If confronted, Lady Vesper fights as a **Vampire** (CR 13) with additional abilities from her decades of experience:
- Lair actions within [[Stahlburg]]'s Thorne manor
- Several charmed guards
- Escape routes prepared throughout the castle
- Will flee rather than risk true death

## Secrets

1. **The Karath Connection:** Vesper was turned by a vampire in [[House Karath]]'s service during [[The Great War]]. That vampire was destroyed, but others may survive in [[The Karath Reach]]. She fears what [[Lord Draven Karath]] might know.

2. **The Master Plan:** Vesper believes [[Edric Valdren]] will eventually take the throne. She intends to have a spawn in his inner circle when he does.

3. **The Faith's Suspicion:** [[High Confessor Maren]] has received disturbing reports about deaths in [[The Eastern March]]. She hasn't connected them to Lady Thorne yet, but the investigation continues.
