# Lord Draven Karath

## Overview
Lord Draven Karath is the vengeful patriarch of [[House Karath]], and the man who has made a bargain with the ancient horror beneath [[The Ashen Fields]]. Twenty-three years ago, his grandfather [[The Mad King|Valdus I]]—the "Mad King"—was killed by his own son [[Prince Edric the Liberator|Prince Edric]] in [[The Great War]]. Draven's father, Prince Kazimir, died fighting for his father's cause. The realm destroyed [[House Karath]] for it—stripped their lands, slaughtered their armies, left them nothing but ashes and graves. Draven has spent his life nursing that hatred. Now, he has found something in those mass graves that will give him power to make the realm pay. He believes he controls it. He is wrong.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human, though corruption is beginning to show
- **Age:** 45, but aging strangely—sometimes looks younger, sometimes ancient
- **Height/Build:** 6'1", broad-shouldered, still powerful; body remains strong even as something eats at him from within
- **Skin/Eyes:** Pale, almost bloodless complexion; eyes are dark brown, but in certain light they seem to have no iris at all—just blackness
- **Hair:** Black streaked with gray at the temples, worn long and unkempt
- **Distinguishing Features:** Veins on his hands and neck are visible and dark, as if the blood running through them is wrong; when angry, shadows seem to deepen around him

### Attire
- **Typical Dress:** Black and gray, the mourning colors [[House Karath]] has worn since the war; his ancestors' sigils in tarnished silver
- **Armor:** Ancient Karath plate, black with age, inscribed with symbols that predate [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]
- **Signature Items:** An iron crown—a replica of the one his grandfather wore—that he has never publicly claimed; a sword that whispers

### Presence
Draven radiates wrongness. Animals shy from him. Children cry. The faithful feel uneasy in his presence without knowing why. When he speaks, people find themselves agreeing before they realize they shouldn't. There is something magnetic and repulsive about him simultaneously—the charisma of corruption.

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Patient Fury:** His anger is cold and old, like embers that have burned for decades; he can wait, plan, and smile while plotting murder
2. **Seductive Certainty:** Speaks with absolute conviction that his cause is just; makes vengeance sound like justice, atrocity sound like necessity

### Ideals
**Vengeance.** My grandfather was betrayed by his own son. My father died fighting for our house. My family was destroyed. My people were punished for a war they didn't start. The realm owes us a debt of blood—and I will collect every drop.

### Bonds
His son [[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]] is the last hope of [[House Karath]]. Draven would do anything to see the boy restored to power—even if it means becoming something that can no longer be called a father.

### Flaws
**Hubris.** Draven believes he controls [[Magic of Eldermyr|the power]] he's bargained with. He thinks he can use [[The Unnamed]] and then discard it when he's done. He is catastrophically wrong, and by the time he realizes it, it may be too late for everyone.

### Motivations
Draven wants restoration. He wants [[House Karath]] ascendant, the other houses destroyed or subjugated, and his son [[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]] crowned king. He wants the realm to remember what it did to his family—and to suffer for it. He tells himself this is justice. [[The Unnamed]] [[The Ashen Fields]] tells him the same thing, in dreams that feel like truth.

## Villainy

### The Bargain
Three years ago, Draven visited [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] alone. He walked into the mass graves where thirty thousand died in a single day. Something spoke to him there—something old, something that had been waiting. It offered him power. It offered him vengeance. All it wanted was to be fed.

Draven accepted. He has been feeding it ever since.

### Methods
- **The Rising Dead:** The corpses in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] rise at his command (or so he believes). He uses them as weapons, terror, and distractions.
- **Political Manipulation:** Karath agents in every major court, spreading rumors, inciting division, weakening the realm from within
- **Corruption Spreading:** The taint of [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] is expanding. Crops fail. Animals go mad. The dead rise in other places. All according to plan (he thinks).
- **Dark Communion:** Regular visits to the Fields to receive instruction from [[The Unnamed]]; each visit changes him a little more

### Crimes
1. **Made a pact with [[The Unnamed]]** — Awakened (or began awakening) an ancient evil
2. **Responsible for the rising dead** — Thousands of corpses walking again
3. **Spreading corruption** — The curse that blights the land is growing because of him
4. **Political destabilization** — His agents work to trigger the civil war
5. **Murder** — Dozens killed to keep his secrets; bodies fed to the Fields

### Justification
"They killed my grandfather. They killed my father. They butchered my family. They burned our lands and salted our fields. They left us to starve while they divided the spoils of their 'righteous war.' I didn't start this—they did. I'm simply finishing it. When my son sits on the throne and the other houses are dust, there will finally be justice. Whatever power I need to use, whatever price I need to pay—it's worth it. They made me this. They only have themselves to blame."

### Ultimate Goal
A Karath king on the throne, the other great houses destroyed, and the realm reborn under his family's rule. That's what Draven tells himself.

What [[The Unnamed]] wants is something else entirely.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Noble (Fallen Dynasty)

**Early Life:** Draven was twelve when his grandfather [[The Mad King|Valdus I]] was killed by his uncle [[Prince Edric the Liberator|Prince Edric]] at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. His father Prince Kazimir—who had fought loyally for the king—died of battle wounds shortly after. Draven watched his house stripped of power, his family scattered or killed, his ancestral lands reduced to scorched earth. He grew up on hatred.

### The Years Between
Draven rebuilt what he could. He managed [[House Karath]]'s diminished holdings, married a minor noblewoman ([[Yelena Karath|Yelena]]'s mother, who died in childbirth), and raised his children to remember what was taken from them. He smiled at the other lords while plotting their deaths. He attended the councils and swallowed insults. He waited.

### The Discovery
Three years ago, something drew him to [[The Ashen Fields]]. A dream, a whisper, an instinct he couldn't explain. He walked among the mass graves and found what was waiting there. [[The Unnamed]] had been trapped for millennia—but [[The Great War]]'s slaughter had weakened its prison. It needed a willing vessel, a human will aligned with its hunger. It found one in Draven.

### Current Status
Draven commands [[House Karath]]'s remaining forces, controls a network of agents throughout the realm, and channels power from [[The Unnamed]]. The rising dead obey him (mostly). The corruption spreads (accelerating). The other houses are distracted by their succession crisis (as planned). Everything is falling into place. The only problem is that Draven is changing. The thing inside him is growing stronger. And sometimes, in the dark, he wonders if he's still the one in control.

## Combat

### Multiattack

### Attacks
| Name | Attack Bonus | Damage | Type | Properties |
|------|--------------|--------|------|------------|
| Blackthorn (longsword) | +8 | 1d8+3 plus 2d6 necrotic | Slashing/Necrotic | Magical, whispers |
| Eldritch Blast | +9 | 3d10+4 | Force | 120 ft. range, 3 beams |

### Signature Abilities
1. **Command the Dead:** As a bonus action, Draven can issue commands to any undead within 120 feet that he has raised or that serve [[The Unnamed]]. Up to 12 undead can follow his orders.

2. **Hunger of the Void:** Once per day, Draven can channel [[The Unnamed]]'s power. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Constitution save or take 8d8 necrotic damage (half on save). Draven heals for half the damage dealt. Using this ability costs him something he can't quite name.

## Minions & Allies

### Lieutenants
1. **[[Yelena Karath]]** — His sister, deeper into darkness than even Draven knows; handles intelligence and magic
2. **The Watcher** — A mute figure in black who guards Draven; may not be entirely human anymore
3. **Captain Yakov** — Commander of the Karath guard; fanatically loyal; knows about the pact and doesn't care

### Forces
- **[[House Karath]] soldiers:** ~2,000 (diminished but fanatical)
- **The Rising Dead:** Currently thousands; growing daily
- **Agents:** Spies in every major court; assassins available

### [[The Unnamed]]
The ancient thing beneath [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] is not Draven's ally—it is his master, though he doesn't accept this. It grants him power, guidance, and the rising dead. In return, it feeds on the corruption spreading through the land, the souls of the dead, and slowly, Draven himself.

## Relationships

### Family
- **Son:** [[Aleksei Karath]] (12) — The only innocent thing Draven cares about; everything he does, he does for [[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]]'s future
- **Sister:** [[Yelena Karath]] — His closest confidant and the only person who knows (almost) everything
- **Father (deceased):** Prince Kazimir — Fought loyally for his father [[The Mad King]]; died of battle wounds; Draven saw him as a martyr
- **Grandfather (deceased):** [[The Mad King]] — Draven has complicated feelings; the King was cruel but was still family

### Enemies
- **[[House Thorne]]** — Led the war against his family; Draven hates them most
- **[[House Valdren]]** — Bought their safety with gold while Karath burned; contemptible
- **[[The Grey Wardens]]** — The only ones actively investigating the rising dead; must be neutralized
- **The Realm** — Everyone who stood by while his house was destroyed

### [[The Unnamed]]
Draven believes their relationship is a partnership. It is not. [[The Unnamed]] is patient. It has waited millennia. It can wait a little longer for Draven to realize the truth—or for it not to matter anymore.

## Story Role

### Threat Level
**Continental** — If Draven's plans succeed, the realm falls. If [[The Unnamed]] fully awakens, the threat becomes far greater.

### Arc
Draven's arc is about the cost of vengeance. He began as a wronged man with legitimate grievances. He has become a monster who endangers everyone, including his own son. His tragedy is that by the time he realizes what he's done, it may be too late to stop it.

### Possible Outcomes
- **Redemption:** Realizes the horror he's unleashed, sacrifices himself to stop [[The Unnamed]]
- **Victory:** Destroys his enemies, puts his son on the throne, then is consumed by the thing he served
- **Destruction:** Defeated before his plans come to fruition; [[The Unnamed]] finds another vessel
- **Transformation:** Loses himself entirely; becomes an avatar of [[The Unnamed]]

### Confrontations
1. **Initial Encounter:** The party learns of Draven's involvement, perhaps through [[House Thorne]] or [[The Grey Wardens|the Grey Wardens]]. They see evidence of his power but not the man himself.

2. **Escalation:** Direct confrontation—Draven reveals himself, perhaps while raiding, negotiating, or demonstrating power. He offers them a choice: join him or die.

3. **Final Confrontation:** In [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] or [[Chernogrod]], with [[The Unnamed]]'s influence visible and Draven barely human anymore. The question: can he be saved, or must he be destroyed?

### Defeat Conditions
Draven can be killed, but killing him doesn't stop [[The Unnamed]]—it may accelerate the awakening. True victory requires:
- Stopping Draven's plan
- Dealing with [[The Unnamed]] (rebinding, destroying, or negotiating)
- Saving [[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]] from his father's fate

## Tactics

### Combat Strategy
Draven leads with intimidation and offers of surrender. If refused:
1. Opens with Darkness + Devil's Sight for advantage
2. Commands undead to engage while he targets spellcasters
3. Uses Hunger of Hadar to control the battlefield
4. If threatened, Shadow Steps away and attacks from range
5. Will retreat if seriously threatened—he's too important to die yet

### Psychological Warfare
- Reminds opponents of what the realm did to his family
- Offers them vengeance for their own grievances
- Threatens loved ones with specific, accurate knowledge
- Implies that surrender is the only sensible option

### Contingencies
1. **If defeated:** [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] has orders to take [[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]] and flee to foreign lands
2. **If killed:** [[The Unnamed]] will find another vessel; Draven's death may accelerate its awakening
3. **If captured:** His agents will attempt rescue or assassination (of him—he knows too much to be questioned)

## Secrets

1. **He is losing control.** [[Magic of Eldermyr|The power]] he channels is changing him. Sometimes he hears [[The Unnamed]]'s voice even when he hasn't summoned it. Sometimes he can't remember hours of his day.

2. **[[The Unnamed]] predates [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]].** It was here before humans, before the gods, before history. [[The Great War]] didn't create it—it just weakened its prison.

3. **[[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]] is showing signs.** Draven's son has begun having nightmares about the Fields. [[The Unnamed]] is interested in the boy. Draven tells himself this is natural; deep down, he knows it's not.

4. **There's still human in him.** Despite everything, Draven loves his son and would die for him. This might be the only way to reach him—or the weapon that destroys him.

5. **He knows he may be damned.** In his darkest moments, Draven understands what he's become. But he's gone too far to stop. The only way out is through.

### Portrait (Bust)
**Prompt:**
> Portrait bust of a corrupted human lord in his mid-forties, male, with an unsettling presence that radiates wrongness even in stillness. Gaunt angular face with harsh bone structure—the Karath look, sharp and predatory like a hunting hawk. High prominent forehead with visible dark veins spreading across his temples like cracks in ice, the corruption in his blood made manifest. Severe dark eyebrows, perpetually furrowed in barely contained fury, one bisected by a thin scar from childhood. Deep-set dark brown eyes beneath heavy brows—in direct light they appear a normal brown, but in shadow or at certain angles they seem to have no iris at all, just pools of absolute void that drink in the viewer's gaze; the whites are bloodshot, yellowing at the edges. Hawkish nose, prominent and aristocratic, inherited from his grandfather the Mad King, with sharp nostrils that flare when his anger rises. High gaunt cheekbones casting deep shadows on his hollow cheeks, giving his face a skull-like quality that worsens each year. Thin cruel lips that rarely smile and when they do it's a predatory expression that never reaches those terrible eyes, perpetually drawn into a slight sneer of contempt. Strong angular jaw with sharp jawline, clenched tight with decades of suppressed rage, dark veins visible along the muscles. Pale bloodless complexion with a waxy quality as if the skin has forgotten how to be alive, corpse-like pallor that worsens in moonlight. Network of dark veins spreading up his neck and throat, the blood within them appearing black rather than red. Black hair streaked with premature gray at the temples, worn long and unkempt past his shoulders, wild and unbrushed—he no longer cares about appearance. Clean-shaven to display every hard line of his corrupted face. Expression of cold patient fury barely contained behind eyes that have seen too much darkness and want to share it. Wearing black and gray noble attire of fine but austere cut, tarnished silver Karath raven sigils at his collar, mourning colors worn for twenty-three years. Shadows gathering around him unnaturally. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on corrupted skin texture, dark veins, and the slow transformation from man to monster, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy dark lord portrait.

### Full Body (In Chernogrod)
**Prompt:**
Full body portrait of a corrupted noble lord standing in the dark throne room of Chernogrod, human male in his mid-forties, tall at six-foot-one with broad shoulders that speak of a warrior's build maintained despite the corruption eating at his soul. Black hair with gray streaks worn long and wild, pale bloodless complexion, dark eyes that shift between brown and absolute void depending on the angle. Visible dark veins on his exposed hands and neck, the wrongness in his blood made manifest. Wearing ancient black plate armor passed down through the Karath line, the metal inscribed with symbols that predate the Faith of the Three—angular, unsettling glyphs that seem to shift when not looked at directly. A black cloak with tarnished silver trim falls from his shoulders. In his right hand he grips Blackthorn, a longsword whose blade seems to absorb light rather than reflect it, faint whispers almost audible emanating from the weapon. On a nearby pedestal rests an iron crown—a replica of the one his grandfather wore—waiting for the day he can claim what was stolen from his house. The throne room around him is ancient stone draped in faded purple and black Karath banners, torches guttering though there is no wind, shadows pooling in corners as if they're alive and watching. His posture is that of a man who has made terrible bargains and would make them again.

### Communing with the Unnamed
**Prompt:**
Lord Draven Karath kneeling at the center of the Ashen Fields at midnight, surrounded by mass graves from which pale arms reach upward. His head is bowed, black and gray robes pooling around him on ash-covered ground, the ancient Karath armor visible beneath. Dark energy swirls around him in tendrils of purple-black mist, connecting him to something vast and terrible that exists just beyond perception. His eyes are closed but tears of black ichor stream down his pale cheeks. Above him, barely visible in the swirling darkness, is the suggestion of something immense—not seen but felt, hungry and patient and utterly alien. The dead around him stand motionless, waiting for commands. A single shaft of sickly moonlight breaks through the perpetually overcast sky to illuminate Draven, making him appear both supplicant and sacrifice. The atmosphere of unholy communion, of a man who has given pieces of himself for power and is running out of pieces to give.
