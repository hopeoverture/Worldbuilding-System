# Lord Varic Valdren

## Overview
Lord Varic Valdren is the cunning patriarch of [[House Valdren]], regent for his grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]], and the wealthiest man in Eldermyr. Behind his genial merchant's smile lies a calculating mind that poisoned a king and now maneuvers to hold power indefinitely. He is not evil—he genuinely believes a child cannot rule and that only Valdren gold can hold the realm together—but his methods are ruthless, and his ambition has no ceiling.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human
- **Age:** 62, weathered but vital; silver hair immaculately groomed
- **Height/Build:** 5'10", lean and elegant; moves like a man half his age
- **Skin/Eyes:** Sun-darkened olive complexion from years on merchant vessels; sharp gray-green eyes that miss nothing
- **Distinguishing Features:** Thin white scar along his right jawline (duel at 25); hands that gesture constantly when speaking; smile that never quite reaches his eyes
- **Presence:** Radiates competent authority; makes everyone feel he's genuinely listening while cataloguing every weakness

### Attire
- **Typical Dress:** Finest Valdren silks in deep blue and gold; subtle rather than ostentatious
- **Signature Items:** Golden ship-and-scales brooch (House sigil); rings on every finger, each a gift or trophy with a story
- **Notable:** Never wears armor or visible weapons; always has a small dagger in his boot

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Perpetual Negotiator:** Views every interaction as a deal to be made; always seeks leverage and mutual benefit
2. **Paternal Condescension:** Treats everyone—including lords and kings—like children who need his guidance

### Ideals
**Stability.** The realm needs a steady hand, not a child king or a warmonger. I alone understand what holds civilization together—gold, trade, and careful management.

### Bonds
His grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] represents both his legacy and his greatest vulnerability. Despite planning to control the boy indefinitely, Varic genuinely loves him and would never directly harm him.

### Flaws
**Arrogance.** Varic believes he is the smartest person in any room. He cannot conceive that others might outmaneuver him—especially not those he considers social inferiors.

### Motivations
Varic wants what every Valdren has wanted: for his house to prosper and endure. But he also craves recognition—he wants history to remember him as the man who saved the realm from itself. The regency was supposed to be temporary. Now he can't imagine letting it go.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Noble (Merchant Dynasty)

**Path:** Third son of [[House Valdren]], Varic was never meant to inherit. He spent his youth on merchant vessels, learning trade routes and foreign courts. When his brothers died in [[The Great War|the Great War]], he found himself patriarch of a house that had bought its survival with gold—and contempt from the martial houses who paid in blood.

### Rise to Power
Varic transformed Valdren from a wealthy trading house into the economic backbone of the realm. He married his daughter to Prince Aldric (later [[High King Aldric II|King Aldric]] II) and positioned himself as essential to the crown. When [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] proved too weak and too expensive, Varic solved the problem with discrete poison—administered by his own daughter, though she doesn't know what she served.

### Current Situation
As regent for his grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]], Varic holds effective control of the realm. He delays the coronation with one excuse after another, builds his network of obligations, and prepares for the day he must deal with the succession crisis. He genuinely believes [[House Thorne]] will start a war and [[House Karath]] will welcome foreign invaders. Only he can prevent this—or so he tells himself.

## Secrets

1. **He poisoned [[High King Aldric II|King Aldric]] II.** A slow-acting poison in his wine, administered over months. Lady Serana served it unknowingly. The king's death looked natural. Only Varic knows the truth.

2. **He knows about the rising dead.** His spy network has reported from [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]. Varic understands something terrible is happening—and he's keeping it quiet because acknowledging it would destabilize the regency.

3. **[[Edric Valdren|Edric]] is not as pliable as he pretends.** The boy is smarter and more stubborn than Varic anticipated. Varic is beginning to realize his grandson may become a genuine threat to his control.

4. **[[House Valdren]] is built on debt.** Valdren's wealth comes largely from loans to noble houses—loans that will come due. If the houses unite against him, they could refuse to pay and destroy him.

5. **He has a contingency.** If things go wrong, Varic has arranged passage to the Sun Courts to the south. He will not die in Eldermyr if he can help it.

## Relationships

### Family
- **Daughter:** Lady Serana Valdren — Widow of [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]], devoted to her son [[Edric Valdren|Edric]], unknowing instrument of her father's regicide
- **Grandson:** [[Edric Valdren]] — [[Edric Valdren|The boy king]], heir to the throne, Varic's puppet and greatest concern
- **Late Son-in-Law:** [[High King Aldric II]] II "[[High King Aldric II]]" — Poisoned by Varic

- **The Counting House** — Merchant guild that owes its charter to Valdren patronage
- **Various lords** — Half the nobility owes Valdren money

### Enemies
- **[[Lady Margret Thorne]]** — Sees through his pretenses; would expose him if she had proof
- **[[Lord Draven Karath]]** — Hates everything Valdren represents; would kill him personally
- **[[High Confessor Maren]]** — Opposes the regency; wants [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] to choose the king

### Complicated
- **[[Edric Valdren]]** — Grandson he loves, puppet he controls, threat he may have to neutralize

## Story Role

### Function
**Primary Role:** Political antagonist / ambiguous power broker

**Threat Level:** Regional — controls the realm's economy and the regency

### Arc
Varic's arc is about the limits of control. He has spent his life manipulating events, but the rising dead and the succession crisis are beyond his ability to manage. He must choose: adapt and genuinely help the realm, or cling to power and become part of the problem.

### Possible Outcomes
- **Reformed:** Realizes the threat is real, supports [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] genuinely, sacrifices his ambitions
- **Exposed:** His crimes come to light; flees or is executed
- **Destroyed:** Outmaneuvered by forces he underestimated; dies clutching his gold
- **Triumphant:** Suppresses all opposition; becomes true power behind the throne

### As an Ally
If the party gains his trust or leverage over him, Varic can provide:
- Vast financial resources
- Intelligence from his spy network
- Political cover and legitimacy
- Access to [[Edric Valdren|the boy king]]

### As an Enemy
If the party opposes him, Varic will:
- Use his spy network to undermine them
- Turn their allies against them with gold and favors
- Deny them resources and support
- Frame them for crimes if desperate

## Roleplay Notes

### Voice & Mannerisms
- **Voice:** Warm, grandfatherly, with a merchant's cadence—always building to an offer
- **Mannerisms:** Gestures with hands while speaking; steeples fingers when listening; often touches his ship-and-scales brooch
- **Tells:** When lying, becomes slightly more formal; when angry, goes very quiet

### Sample Dialogue

> "My dear friend, there's always a deal to be made. The question is whether you're clever enough to see it—and I think you are."

> "The boy is too young. The realm needs stability. I do what I do for Eldermyr, not for myself. Surely you understand that?"

> "[[House Thorne]] wants war. [[House Karath]] wants revenge. And what do [[House Valdren|the Valdrens]] want? Only what we've always wanted—peace and prosperity. Is that so terrible?"

> "You think I'm the villain? I've kept this realm from tearing itself apart for twenty-three years. What have you done?"

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Regent's Offer:** Varic approaches the party with a lucrative contract—investigate the rising dead, quietly. He'll pay well and provide resources, but he wants to control what they find.

2. **The Poison Secret:** Evidence of [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]'s murder could surface. The party might discover it, be hired to find it, or be framed with it.

3. **[[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s Escape:** [[Edric Valdren|The boy king]] wants out from his grandfather's control. He needs allies who aren't in Varic's pocket.

4. **The Debt Comes Due:** A lord refuses to pay his Valdren debt. This could spark a crisis—or an opportunity.

### Portrait (Bust)
**Prompt:**
> Portrait bust of a distinguished human nobleman in his early sixties, male, the wealthy regent of a realm. Long aristocratic face with high cheekbones that speak of refined breeding. Broad intelligent forehead with deep horizontal lines from decades of calculation. Thin silver eyebrows, elegantly arched, perpetually raised as if amused by a secret only he knows. Deep-set gray-green eyes beneath hooded lids, sharp and evaluating—they miss nothing and give nothing away; fine crow's feet at the corners from a lifetime of false smiles. Aquiline nose, prominent and patrician, slightly hooked at the bridge. Thin lips that curve easily into a warm grandfatherly smile that never quite reaches those calculating eyes. Strong angular jaw softened slightly by age, with a thin white scar running along the right jawline from a duel at twenty-five—a reminder he was dangerous once. Weathered olive complexion from years on merchant vessels, sun-darkened but well-maintained, with age spots beginning to appear at the temples. Silver hair immaculately groomed and swept back from his forehead, still thick despite his years. Clean-shaven, the better to show every carefully controlled expression. Hands visible and gesturing—always gesturing when he speaks—with multiple rings on every finger, each a gift or trophy with a story. Expression is warm and genial, the face of everyone's favorite grandfather, while those gray-green eyes betray the cold calculation beneath. Wearing deep blue silk with gold trim, golden ship-and-scales brooch at collar. Background: blurred luxurious study with merchant ledgers and maps. Warm candlelight with cool highlights creating a play of shadow that suits a man who lives in moral gray areas.
