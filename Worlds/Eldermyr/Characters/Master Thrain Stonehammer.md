# Master Thrain Stonehammer

## Overview

Master Thrain Stonehammer is the senior dwarf smith of [[Hammerhall]] and the unofficial voice of the dwarven community in [[The Eastern March]]. Though [[Grimhild the Smith]] holds the title of Guildmaster, it is Thrain who speaks for the everyday craftsmen—the hundreds of smiths, miners, and artisans who form the backbone of Hammerhall's legendary forges.

At 187 years old, Thrain has seen the rise and fall of kings, the horrors of [[The Great War]], and the slow rebuilding of the realm's industry. His experience makes him invaluable as both craftsman and counselor. When [[House Thorne]] needs weapons, they speak with Grimhild. When they need to understand what the dwarves actually think, they speak with Thrain.

## Appearance

Thrain is broad even by dwarven standards, his arms thick with muscle from nearly two centuries at the forge. His beard, once copper-red, has faded to iron gray streaked with white—he braids it with iron rings forged from the first ore he ever smelted. His hands are calloused and scarred, marked by countless burns and minor injuries that are the badges of a working smith.

He dresses simply: a leather apron over sturdy work clothes, heavy boots, and a smith's hammer always at his belt. His one concession to status is a torque of twisted iron and silver that marks him as a Master of the Guild.

## Personality

Thrain is patient in the way of stone—slow to anger, slow to forget. He speaks deliberately, weighing each word as carefully as he weighs ore. This measured approach has made him an effective mediator between dwarven traditionalists and human authorities.

Despite his calm demeanor, Thrain carries deep concerns about the future. The duergar raiders at [[The Iron Redoubt]] trouble him greatly—he knows what darkness lies beneath the mountains, and he fears what their presence might herald.

## Role in Hammerhall

### Voice of the Dwarves
Thrain represents the interests of Hammerhall's dwarven population in dealings with [[House Thorne]] and the broader realm. He negotiates wages, working conditions, and the sensitive matter of dwarven autonomy within human-ruled territory.

### Master Craftsman
Though he focuses more on leadership than craft these days, Thrain remains one of Hammerhall's finest smiths. He still takes on special commissions—weapons for heroes, ceremonial pieces, items requiring techniques known only to the oldest masters.

### Keeper of Traditions
Thrain maintains the old dwarven ways within the Guild, ensuring that sacred techniques and ancestral knowledge are passed to the next generation. He leads the ceremonies that mark a journeyman's elevation to master.

## Knowledge of The Iron Redoubt

Thrain knows the history of [[The Iron Redoubt]] better than any living dwarf. His grandfather helped build it; his father worked its mines; he himself was born there before the evacuation. The outpost's loss haunts him—a failure of dwarven vigilance that cost lives and ceded ground to the darkness below.

When the duergar occupied the Redoubt, Thrain recognized the threat immediately. He has been quietly gathering information and building support for a response, waiting for the right moment—and the right allies—to reclaim what was lost.
