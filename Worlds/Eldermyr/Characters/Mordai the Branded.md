# Mordai the Branded

## Overview

Mordai the Branded is the de facto leader of [[Port Corsair]]'s tiefling community—nearly 2,400 souls who have found refuge in the one place in Eldermyr where their kind can live openly. He earned his epithet from the brands he bears: holy symbols burned into his skin by [[The Faith of the Three]]'s inquisitors before he escaped the mainland. Those brands have become symbols of tiefling resilience, and Mordai has become a symbol of hope for the persecuted.

He rules the Branded District not through official appointment but through respect, cunning, and the simple fact that he has kept his people alive when the rest of Eldermyr wants them dead or converted.

## Appearance

Mordai is a striking figure—tall and lean, with crimson skin and swept-back horns that curve elegantly behind his pointed ears. His eyes are solid gold, without visible pupil or iris, and seem to glow faintly in dim light. His tail, which he doesn't hide, is tipped with a small barb.

Most notable are the brands that cover his chest and arms: holy symbols of [[The Faith of the Three]] burned into his flesh during three separate "purification" attempts. He wears open-chested shirts specifically to display these scars. Let them see what their faith does.

His clothing is fine but practical—silk shirts, leather boots, a blade always at his hip. He dresses like the merchant he claims to be, but moves like the killer he was forced to become.

## Personality

Mordai is charming, careful, and coldly furious. He has learned to smile while calculating exactly how to destroy someone who threatens his people. Decades of persecution have taught him that tieflings survive through intelligence, not confrontation—but also that sometimes confrontation is the only option.

He genuinely cares about Port Corsair's tieflings, regarding them as family regardless of blood. But that care coexists with a pragmatic ruthlessness. Mordai will sacrifice individuals to protect the community. He will make ugly deals with ugly people. He will do whatever it takes.

## History of Persecution

### The First Branding
Mordai was born in [[The Crown Lands]] to a human mother and a tiefling father. When he was twelve, his father was executed for "devil worship"—the crime of being born. Mordai and his mother were subjected to "purification" rituals. His mother died. Mordai survived, branded but alive.

### The Second Branding
At twenty-three, Mordai was captured in [[The Eastern March]] after years of living in hiding. [[House Thorne]]'s chaplains attempted a more thorough purification. He escaped during transfer to a prison, killing two guards in the process.

### The Third Branding
A decade later, established in [[Porto Valdris]] under a false identity, Mordai was discovered and captured by [[The Faith of the Three]]'s inquisitors. The third branding was meant to kill him—it nearly did. He was rescued by other tieflings and smuggled to [[Port Corsair]], where he has remained ever since.

## Role in Port Corsair

### Voice of the Tieflings
Mordai speaks for the tiefling community in all dealings with Port Corsair's human authorities. He negotiates their rights, resolves disputes, and ensures that the compact allowing tiefling residence is maintained. The Valdren officials find him unsettling but effective.

### Protector
The Branded District has never been attacked by mobs, never been raided by zealots, never suffered the "accidents" that befall tiefling communities elsewhere. This is not coincidence. Mordai maintains a network of informants, enforcers, and contingency plans. Those who threaten his people disappear.

### Underground Railroad
Mordai operates a secret network that smuggles tieflings from the mainland to Port Corsair. The routes change constantly, the methods are varied, but the result is consistent: hundreds of tieflings have escaped persecution through Mordai's organization.

### Legitimate Business
Officially, Mordai is a merchant dealing in exotic goods. This business is real and profitable, providing cover for his other activities and income for community needs. His ships carry more than cargo, but the cargo is genuine.

## The Branded District

The tiefling quarter of Port Corsair, officially called the Merchant's Ward South, is universally known as the Branded District. It's a close-knit neighborhood where tieflings can live openly, run businesses, raise families, and practice their own traditions without fear.

Mordai's headquarters—a combination tavern, meeting hall, and fortified refuge called **The Burning Brand**—sits at the district's heart. Here, tieflings gather to share news, seek help, and remember that they are not alone.

## Political Position

### Relationship with House Valdren
[[House Valdren]] tolerates Port Corsair's tieflings because they're useful—skilled sailors, cunning merchants, and a community that doesn't require the expensive social services that other refugees need. Mordai cultivates this relationship carefully, ensuring tieflings remain useful while never becoming threatening.

### The Faith's Hatred
[[The Faith of the Three]] considers Port Corsair's tiefling community an abomination. Missionaries occasionally arrive to "save" tiefling souls; they're politely escorted to the docks. Inquisitors have learned not to come at all—the few who tried never left.

### The Succession Crisis
Mordai watches the mainland's chaos with mixed feelings. Instability creates refugees—more tieflings needing rescue. But it also creates opportunity—if the right faction takes power, perhaps tieflings could gain legal protection. He's quietly cultivating contacts with all sides.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Extraction:** A tiefling family in [[Thornhall]] is about to be arrested. Mordai needs help getting them out before the inquisitors arrive—and the timeline is days, not weeks.

2. **The Informant:** Someone in the Branded District is feeding information to [[The Faith of the Three]]. Mordai can't investigate himself without tipping off the traitor. He needs outside help to identify the spy.

3. **The Inquisitor's Visit:** An inquisitor is coming to Port Corsair—officially to "inspect" religious compliance. Mordai needs help ensuring the visit goes smoothly while hiding the community's most vulnerable members.

4. **The Mainland Connection:** Mordai has learned of a tiefling community hiding in [[Aldersgate]]'s sewers. They need extraction, but the operation would be visible and dangerous. He needs capable operatives who can work in the capital without tiefling faces drawing attention.

5. **The Branded's Secret:** Mordai's brands aren't just scars—the priests who made them used real power, and that power lingers. He's begun experiencing visions, voices, connections to something infernal. He needs help understanding what was done to him before it consumes him.
