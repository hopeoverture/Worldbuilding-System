# Old Marta

## Overview
Old Marta—Marta Blackblade to those who knew her in her fighting days—is a legend of [[Eldoria]]'s adventuring past now serving as the proprietor of [[The Crossed Swords Inn]]. Sixty-three years old with fifty of those spent swinging swords, she runs the city's premier adventurer's tavern with the same iron will she once applied to dungeons and battlefields. Her establishment is neutral ground in a fractured city, and she intends to keep it that way.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Old Marta is built like a barrel that's been reinforced for combat—short, broad, and impossible to move unless she chooses to be moved. Her grey hair is cropped short and practical, refusing any styling that might get in her eyes. Her face is a roadmap of a violent life: scars cross her cheeks and forehead, her nose has been broken at least twice, and her left ear is missing its upper half. But it's a face that also shows laugh lines deep as canyons around eyes sharp as broken glass. She moves with the careful deliberation of joints that ache after decades of abuse, but her hands are still quick enough to catch a thrown knife.

### Attire
Marta dresses practically—sturdy wool and leather that can take a spilled drink or a sudden fight. She keeps her sleeves rolled up, showing forearms corded with old muscle and decorated with faded tattoos from mercenary companies long disbanded. A belt of worn leather holds tools of her trade: keys, a club, and a knife that's been with her for forty years. She never wears armor anymore, but she doesn't need to—her reputation is her armor.

## Personality

### Traits
1. She insults people she likes and is coldly polite to people she doesn't trust
2. She never forgets a face, a story, or a debt—her memory is legendary and frightening

### Ideals
**Honest Work:** "I've killed for coin in my time. Now I serve ale for coin. Both are honest trades if you do them clean."

### Bonds
[[The Crossed Swords Inn]] is her legacy—she'll defend it and its reputation with her life. The regulars are the closest thing she has to family now that all her adventuring companions are dead or retired.

### Flaws
She's getting old, and she knows it. Her reflexes aren't what they were, her joints ache in the cold, and sometimes she forgets things for the first time in her life. She's terrified of becoming helpless.

### Demeanor
Gruff, direct, and unsentimental, Old Marta doesn't coddle anyone—but those who earn her respect find a loyal ally. She treats everyone the same: noble and commoner, veteran and greenhorn, all get the same sharp tongue and honest assessment. She's seen too much to be impressed by titles or gold.

## Role

### Function
**Primary:** Informant / Quest-giver

**Secondary:** Mentor (reluctantly)

### Expertise
- Adventuring lore and practical dungeon survival
- The who's who of [[Eldoria]]'s mercenary and adventuring community
- Fighting techniques (she'll still spar with those who earn it)
- Knowing which jobs are legitimate and which are traps

### Availability
- Found at [[The Crossed Swords Inn]] virtually every day
- Most accessible in the morning or late at night when the crowd thins
- Will make time for those she respects
- Her office (the back of the bar) is invitation-only

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Soldier / Folk Hero

**Occupation:** Innkeeper (retired adventurer)

**Path:** Marta started as a soldier's daughter who picked up a sword when she was twelve. By fifteen, she was fighting in her first campaign; by twenty, she was leading her own band. For thirty years, she traveled the realm and beyond, facing horrors that would break most people and accumulating enough gold, stories, and scars to retire comfortably. She bought the Crossed Swords twenty years ago and has run it ever since.

### History with Protagonists
Marta evaluates newcomers with a veteran's eye. Those who prove capable and honorable will find her a valuable source of information, jobs, and the occasional hard wisdom. Those who cross her find their reputation destroyed in an hour as she tells everyone who'll listen.

### Current Situation
The succession crisis has complicated Marta's life. Her inn's neutrality is being tested daily as factions try to make it their territory. She's had to throw out more troublemakers in the past three months than the past three years. She worries about what happens when neutrality becomes impossible.

### Combat Role
Marta fights defensively now, protecting her staff and establishment rather than seeking glory. She uses the terrain of her inn—tables, chairs, the bar itself—to her advantage, and isn't above dirty tricks learned in fifty years of violence.

## Class Features
- Fighting Style: Protection
- Second Wind
- Action Surge
- Extra Attack
- Indomitable
- Battle Master: Superiority Dice (4d8), Maneuvers (Riposte, Disarming Attack, Menacing Attack, Rally)

## Species Traits
- Human Versatility

## Feats
- Tavern Brawler
- Sentinel

## Equipment

### Notable Items
- **Old Reliable:** Her longsword from her adventuring days, hung behind the bar—still sharp, still deadly
- **The Founder's Keys:** Keys to every room in the Crossed Swords, including the hidden ones
- **The Black Ledger:** Her personal record of debts, favors, and secrets accumulated over fifty years
- **Marta's Medallion:** A trophy from her greatest kill (she never says what it was)

### Resources
- Ownership of [[The Crossed Swords Inn]]
- Network of retired adventurers throughout [[Eldoria]]
- Reputation that makes troublemakers think twice
- Modest savings from fifty years of dangerous work

## Relationships

### To Protagonists
A demanding but valuable contact. She tests newcomers, respects those who prove themselves, and helps those she deems worthy with information, advice, and occasionally the occasional job that's too small for her usual clientele.

### Personal Life
- Never married—"Never found anyone worth slowing down for"
- Her adventuring companions are mostly dead; she visits their graves on anniversaries
- [[Commander Brennan Steel]] is an old friend from [[The Great War]]
- She informally adopted Tam (her bouncer) after finding him half-dead in an alley

### Enemies
- Several criminal organizations would like her gone or compromised
- A few survivors of adventuring parties she defeated still hold grudges
- The Valdren faction resents her neutrality

## Story Role

### Purpose
Old Marta is the classic "retired adventurer innkeeper"—a source of quests, information, and hard-won wisdom. She represents what successful adventurers might become and serves as a bridge between the players and [[Eldoria]]'s mercenary community.

### Arc
Her arc involves the increasing pressure on her neutrality. As the crisis deepens, maintaining the Crossed Swords as neutral ground becomes harder. She may need to choose sides, call in old debts, or finally pick up her sword again.

### Stakes
If Marta falls or her inn loses its neutral status, the adventuring community in [[Eldoria]] loses its anchor. The Crossed Swords is more than a tavern—it's an institution that facilitates legitimate work. Without it, the mercenary trade becomes more chaotic and dangerous.

### Complications
- Her network of informants is being targeted
- Someone is trying to prove she's faction-aligned
- Her health is declining faster than she admits
- An old enemy has arrived in [[Eldoria]]

## Roleplay Notes

### Voice & Mannerisms
- Speaks in a gravelly voice worn by decades of shouting orders
- Calls everyone "lad" or "lass" regardless of their age or status
- Habit of polishing glasses while she talks, even when they're clean
- Laughs loudly at good jokes and deadly silence at bad ones
- Remembers every drink ever ordered by every regular

### Topics of Interest
- Adventuring stories (especially failures—she learns from those)
- The state of the mercenary trade
- Old companions and their fates
- Proper sword maintenance

### Conversation Hooks
- "You've got the look. How many have you killed, and how many deserved it?"
- "I knew someone like you once. They died badly. Try not to repeat their mistakes."
- "Buying information? Depends what you want and what you're worth."

### Sample Dialogue

> "Lad, I've killed things you've never heard of in places you can't pronounce. Don't lecture me about danger."

> "The Crossed Swords is neutral. You want to talk politics, do it outside. You want to fight politics, do it outside. Am I clear?"

> "Everyone's a hero in their own story. I've buried a lot of heroes. The smart ones learned when to run."

## Secrets

1. She knows [[Lady Whisper]]'s true identity from forty years ago when they worked a job together. Neither has revealed this to anyone, and they have an unspoken understanding that they never will.

2. The cellar of the Crossed Swords has a hidden room where she's sheltered refugees from multiple regimes over the years. She's never told the Crown Guard, and she never will.

3. She has a terminal illness that she hasn't told anyone about. She has perhaps two years left and is quietly making arrangements for what happens to the inn after she's gone.

### Portrait (Bust)
**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a retired human adventurer and innkeeper, female, sixty-three years old with every one of those years visible in the scars, wrinkles, and hard-earned lines of her face. Built like a barrel—short and broad and impossible to tip over, the physique of someone who survived fifty years of violence through sheer stubborn refusal to fall. A face that is a map of battles: scars crossing her cheeks and forehead, a nose broken at least twice and set crooked, the upper half of her left ear missing, but all of it surrounded by laugh lines deep as canyons. Sharp blue eyes that have seen death up close and learned to stare it down, now assessing everyone who walks into her establishment with automatic threat evaluation. Short grey hair cropped practical and military, refusing any vanity. A mouth set in a line that could be skepticism or suppressed amusement—she finds most things either annoying or funny, and often both. Wearing practical wool and leather, sleeves rolled up to show forearms corded with old muscle and decorated with faded tattoos from mercenary companies long disbanded. Hands visible, strong and scarred and capable, one holding a tankard and the other resting where a sword hilt would be from decades of habit. A belt of worn leather visible, holding keys and a knife that's been with her for forty years. Expression of hard-won wisdom, the look of someone who has killed and buried and survived to tell stories about it. Background: the interior of the Crossed Swords Inn, the bar and trophy wall behind her, the warm firelight of her domain. Warm firelight catching the scars and the sharp intelligence in her eyes. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on aged adventurer's features and practical clothing, dramatic atmosphere of experience and hard-earned wisdom, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy retired adventurer innkeeper portrait illustration.

## Notes
Old Marta is designed as the quintessential "retired adventurer" NPC—someone who represents what the players might become and who can provide quests, information, and mentorship. Her neutral ground provides a safe space for political intrigue without direct combat, and her secrets connect her to larger campaign threads.
