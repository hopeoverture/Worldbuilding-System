# Prince Edric the Liberator

## Overview
Prince Edric Karath was the eldest son of [[The Mad King]] who led the rebellion against his own father and struck the killing blow at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. He died moments after slaying the tyrant, making him both a parricide and the realm's greatest hero. His sacrifice ended [[The Great War]] but left no clear heir to the throne. The current heir, [[Edric Valdren]], was named in his honor.

## History

### Early Life
Edric was born to King Valdus and Queen Elena Karath during the prosperous early years of his father's reign. He was raised as crown prince—trained in arms, educated in statecraft, groomed to rule. He was everything a prince should be: brave, honorable, charismatic.

### The Change
Edric watched his father's slow descent into madness with horror. He pleaded with Valdus to cease the purges, to stop the rituals, to remember who he had been. When Valdus demanded "tribute" of living prisoners, Edric knew his father was lost.

### The Rebellion
At age 25, Prince Edric fled the capital and declared against his father. He gave the rebellion legitimacy—a royal prince condemning royal tyranny. He joined with Lord Edmund Thorne and Lord Marcus Valdren, providing intelligence about his father's forces and the layout of royal fortifications.

### The War
For three years, Edric fought against his own house. He commanded the left flank at major battles. He was wounded twice. He watched friends die fighting soldiers who had once been loyal to him. The weight of parricide pressed on him even before the final battle.

### The Final Day
At [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], when the armies clashed and the dead rose, Edric challenged his father to single combat. What happened next is disputed. Some say Valdus was no longer human—that [[The Unnamed]] spoke through him, offering Edric power if he would only kneel. Edric refused.

The combat was brief and terrible. Edric's blade burned with holy light—blessed by [[The Faith of the Three]]. Valdus unleashed darkness that should have killed any mortal. In the end, Edric drove his sword through his father's heart. Valdus fell. And Edric, wounds too severe to survive, collapsed beside him.

He died within the hour. His last words, according to Lord Edmund Thorne, were: "It's done. Don't let it be for nothing."

## The Letter

Before the battle, Edric wrote a letter explaining his actions. He knew he might not survive. The letter describes what Valdus had become—a vessel for [[The Unnamed]]—and why capture was not an option. The letter also reveals that [[The Blackened Crown]] survived the battle, though Edric did not know who took it.

The letter was hidden at [[The Ashen Fields]], buried with other battlefield artifacts. It has never been found. Its discovery could change everything the realm believes about the war.

## Legacy

### The Hero
Edric is remembered as the realm's savior—the prince who sacrificed everything to stop a tyrant. Songs are sung about him. Children are named after him. [[Edric Valdren]], the current heir, bears his name as a blessing and a burden.

### The Parricide
To [[House Karath]], Edric is more complicated. He saved the realm, yes—but he killed their king. [[Lord Draven Karath]] was taught to honor his uncle's sacrifice, but the Karath folk remember that Edric sided with their enemies. Some call him hero; others call him traitor.

### The Mystery
Those who study history note inconsistencies. Edric was a skilled warrior, but Valdus was enhanced by dark magic. How did Edric survive long enough to strike the killing blow? Some believe [[The Faith of the Three]] granted him divine protection. Others suspect Edric made his own bargain—one he paid for with his life.

## Personality

### The Honorable Prince
Edric was genuinely good. He treated servants with respect, kept his word, and believed in justice. He would have made a great king—which made his death all the more tragic.

### The Burdened Son
Edric loved his father despite everything. Killing Valdus broke something in him. Witnesses say he wept as he struck the final blow. He did not want to be a parricide. He did what he believed necessary.

### The Reluctant Hero
Edric never sought glory. He led the rebellion because no one else could give it legitimacy. He fought because the alternative was worse. He died because he refused to let anyone else bear the burden of killing a king.

## Secrets

1. **He Knew What His Father Became.** Edric understood that Valdus was a vessel for [[The Unnamed]]. His letter explains that killing the body would not kill the entity—only trap it. He hoped that would be enough.

2. **He Was Offered Power.** During the final duel, [[The Unnamed]] offered Edric everything—the crown, immortality, his father restored to sanity. Edric refused. The entity's rage at his refusal may be why the curse persists.

3. **His Body Was Never Properly Buried.** In the chaos after the battle, Edric's body was placed in a mass grave with common soldiers. Only Lord Edmund Thorne knew, and he died before he could arrange a proper tomb. Edric's spirit may be among the unquiet dead.

### The Final Moment
**Prompt:**
The climactic moment of the Battle of Ashen Fields: Prince Edric the Liberator driving his holy blade through the heart of his own father, the Mad King Valdus Karath. Edric is twenty-eight years old, handsome even beneath the grime of battle, his face a mask of anguish as tears cut clean tracks through the blood and ash on his cheeks. His armor—once polished steel bearing the purple raven of House Karath—is dented and bloodied from hours of fighting, one pauldron torn away entirely. In his hands, his longsword blazes with pure white-gold light, blessed by the Faith of the Three, the only weapon capable of striking down what his father has become. The blade is buried to the crossguard in Valdus's chest, and light pours from the wound like liquid fire. The Mad King is barely human anymore: his face twisted with something inhuman that speaks with a voice not his own, the Blackened Crown upon his brow crackling with purple-black energy that wars against the holy light, his robes of royal purple rotted and gray, one skeletal hand still raised to cast darkness that will never come. Father and son are locked together in this eternal moment—one dying, one killing, both destroyed. Around them, the battlefield stretches in every direction: bodies of soldiers from both sides lying in heaps, some wearing Karath colors, some Thorne, some Valdren, and among them the risen dead who have fallen a second time. The sky above is ash-gray, churning with unnatural clouds that seem to scream. The ground is churned mud and blood and ash. The atmosphere of triumph and tragedy inseparable, of a son's love expressed through the most terrible act imaginable, of a realm saved at the cost of everything.

### Portrait of the Prince
**Prompt:**
Portrait of Prince Edric Karath in his prime, painted from life before the rebellion that would make him the Liberator and cost him everything. A young man of twenty-five, with the dark hair and strong features of the Karath line, but eyes that hold warmth where his father's hold madness. His face is handsome in a noble way—strong jaw, high cheekbones, the bearing of someone raised to rule—but there's genuine kindness in his expression, a slight smile that reaches his eyes. He wears the formal attire of a crown prince: rich purple doublet with black embroidery in the pattern of ravens, a silver circlet marking his station, the Karath sigil in gold at his breast. His hands rest on the pommel of a sword—the same blade that will one day burn with holy light. Behind him, the suggestion of Chernogrod in its days of glory, before the curse, before the war. The atmosphere of a prince who would have been a great king, captured in paint before fate demanded something different of him.

### The Unquiet Grave
**Prompt:**
A mass grave at the edge of the Ashen Fields at twilight, where Prince Edric the Liberator was laid to rest among common soldiers in the chaos following the battle—a hero's burial denied. The grave is a long trench, marked only by a crude wooden cross that has weathered twenty-three years of ash and neglect. The earth above is disturbed, as all graves are here: hands reach upward from the soil, corpses stir in their endless unrest. But in one section of the grave, a faint golden glow pulses beneath the earth—the remains of a prince still blessed by the Faith, still fighting even in death, the holy light that infused his blade in life persisting beyond mortality. The risen dead avoid this section, circling around it as if repelled. Among the disturbed earth, barely visible, the glint of armor that was once royal: a crushed helmet, a torn piece of purple cloth, the hilt of a sword that no longer glows. The sky is the permanent gray of the cursed lands, ash drifting like snow. In the distance, the Figure that might be the Mad King stands watching, as if waiting to see if his son will finally rise to join the army of the dead. The atmosphere of tragedy upon tragedy, of a hero denied proper rest, of holiness persisting in a place of corruption.
