# Rosie Goodbarrel

## Overview

Rosie Goodbarrel is the unofficial but universally acknowledged leader of [[Millford]]'s halfling community—nearly 900 souls who've made the market village their home for generations. At 78, she's lived through the horrors of [[The Great War]], the quiet rebuilding under [[High King Aldric II]], and now watches the succession crisis threaten everything her people have built.

She leads not through title but through respect. When disputes arise, halflings bring them to Rosie. When human authorities need to address the halfling quarter, they speak with Rosie. When young halflings consider leaving for the cities, Rosie reminds them why home matters.

## Appearance

Rosie is small even by halfling standards, her frame bent slightly by age but her movements still quick and purposeful. Her hair has gone entirely white, worn in a practical bun secured with a copper pin that belonged to her grandmother. Her face is a map of laugh lines, though lately worry has added new creases around her eyes.

She dresses simply—practical homespun in earth tones, always with an apron that holds whatever she might need: herbs, a small knife, a handkerchief, hard candy for children. Her feet are bare and leathery, as befits a proper halfling.

## Personality

Rosie combines a grandmother's warmth with a merchant's shrewdness. She genuinely cares for her community—she remembers every birth, mourns every death, and knows whose children are courting whom. But that warmth hides a pragmatic mind that has navigated her people through dangerous times.

She distrusts big folk politics ("Humans fight over crowns while the fields need tending") but understands that halflings survive by being useful and unremarkable. She teaches her people to be generous neighbors, reliable workers, and invisible when trouble comes.

## Role in Millford

### Community Arbiter
Rosie settles disputes among halflings with a mix of wisdom and social pressure. Her judgments are respected because she's fair, because she remembers who helped whom twenty years ago, and because disappointing Grandmother Rosie is worse than any official punishment.

### Political Buffer
When human authorities—tax collectors, military recruiters, suspicious nobles—come to the halfling quarter, they deal with Rosie. She knows how to make problems go away with a pie, a bit of gossip, or a well-placed "gift." The humans think she's a harmless old woman. She prefers it that way.

### Memory Keeper
Rosie maintains the oral history of Millford's halflings—who came from where, which families are related, what debts remain from three generations back. This knowledge makes her invaluable as matchmaker, dispute settler, and keeper of secrets.

### Crisis Planner
The community keeps emergency supplies in hidden caches throughout the quarter—food, tools, medicines—refreshed under Rosie's supervision. During [[The Great War]], these preparations saved lives when armies swept through. Rosie has been quietly expanding them since the succession crisis began.

## Concerns and Goals

### The Succession Crisis
Rosie doesn't care who sits on the throne, but she cares deeply about what war would do to [[Millford]]. The village sits on major trade routes—perfect for armies to pass through, forage from, and conscript. She's been making quiet preparations: strengthening ties with human neighbors, identifying places to hide, stockpiling supplies.

### The Next Generation
Many young halflings dream of adventure or city life. Rosie has seen enough to know that halflings survive by community, and scattered individuals are vulnerable. She walks a careful line between encouraging youths to find their path and reminding them that home will always need them.

### The Spreading Darkness
Rosie has noticed the refugees trickling north from [[The Karath Reach]]. She's heard the rumors about [[The Ashen Fields]]. Unlike many humans who dismiss such talk, halflings have long memories of old evils. Rosie is worried—and a worried halfling matriarch is a preparing halfling matriarch.

## The Goodbarrel Legacy

The Goodbarrel family has lived in [[Millford]] for eight generations, establishing themselves as farmers and merchants. Rosie's grandmother, Marigold Goodbarrel, sheltered refugees during the purges of [[The Mad King]]'s reign. Her father, Tomas, rebuilt the family fortunes after [[The Great War]]. Rosie sees herself as custodian of this legacy.

Her children and grandchildren are scattered throughout the halfling quarter: her eldest son Pip runs the family farm; her daughter Daisy manages the Goodbarrel store; various grandchildren work trades or tend gardens. All report to Grandmother Rosie about community matters.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Quiet Preparation:** Rosie approaches adventurers about a sensitive matter—she needs certain supplies moved into the halfling quarter without human authorities noticing. The supplies are innocent (food, medicine) but her caution suggests she expects trouble.

2. **The Missing Grandchild:** One of Rosie's grandchildren has gone to [[Aldersgate]] seeking adventure and hasn't written in too long. Rosie offers generous payment (and a lifetime of halfling hospitality) to anyone who brings the youngster home safely.

3. **The Old Debts:** Rosie knows secrets about noble families from generations of halfling servants observing their masters. Someone powerful wants that knowledge suppressed—or exploited.

4. **Refugee Crisis:** Refugees from [[The Karath Reach]] are arriving in [[Millford]], and the human authorities want to turn them away. Rosie needs help providing for them without attracting official attention.
