# Saltbeard Pete

## Overview
Saltbeard Pete—born Piotr Markov—is a retired smuggler who traded open water for a different kind of dangerous navigation. As proprietor of [[The Drowned Rat Tavern]], he runs the central hub of [[Eldoria]]'s maritime underworld, facilitating everything from blockade running to discrete disappearances. He claims neutrality in the faction wars, but his real loyalty is to profit—and the elaborate web of payments he receives from every side.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Pete looks exactly like a smuggler gone to seed—which is what he is. His face is weathered leather, tanned and creased by decades of sun and salt, with a permanent squint from watching too many horizons. His most distinctive feature is his beard, grey and stiff with sea salt despite not having been to sea in fifteen years—he maintains it deliberately as part of his brand. He's missing two fingers on his left hand (the story changes every time someone asks), and he walks with the rolling gait of a man whose legs never adjusted to solid ground. His eyes are pale grey and see everything while appearing to see nothing.

### Attire
Pete dresses like what he was—practical sailor's clothes that have seen better decades. Wool sweater with salt stains he never bothers removing, heavy canvas trousers, boots that were resoled so many times there's nothing left of the original. He wears a heavy leather apron when behind the bar, more for the hidden pockets than for protection. A knife is always visible at his belt; at least two more aren't.

## Personality

### Traits
1. He speaks in a gravelly voice with a heavy Eastern accent that he exaggerates when it's useful
2. He has a sawed-off crossbow under the bar and has used it exactly three times in fifteen years—three people who aren't missed

### Ideals
**Everyone Pays:** "Loyalty is for people who can't afford to be neutral. Me, I take coin from all sides and give each of them exactly what they paid for. That's honest business."

### Bonds
The Drowned Rat is his retirement, his legacy, and his fortress. He'll do whatever it takes to keep it standing and profitable.

### Flaws
His elaborate system of double-dealing will eventually collapse when two of his clients compare notes. He's also getting older and slower, and the young predators in the underworld are starting to notice.

### Demeanor
Pete presents himself as a simple tavern keeper who happens to know people—plausible deniability is his profession. He speaks little, watches much, and gives the impression of tired cynicism while calculating profit margins in his head.

## Role

### Function
**Primary:** Information Broker / Fence Contact

**Secondary:** Quest-giver (for shady work)

### Expertise
- Smuggling routes around the Valdren blockade
- The criminal hierarchy of [[Eldoria]]'s Docks
- Ship captains willing to ask no questions
- The tunnels beneath the Docks district

### Availability
- Found at [[The Drowned Rat Tavern]] from sunset to dawn
- Most talkative after a few drinks—or a few coins
- Private conversations happen in the Admiral's Corner
- Doesn't do business before sunset

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Sailor / Criminal

**Occupation:** Tavern Keeper / Information Broker

**Path:** Pete grew up in the coastal villages of [[The Karath Reach]], went to sea at twelve, and started smuggling at sixteen. For twenty years, he ran contraband through every port in Eldermyr, building a network of contacts and a reputation for reliability. When the revenue cutters finally got too close, he retired to [[Eldoria]] and bought the Drowned Rat—trading open water for a different kind of navigation.

### History with Protagonists
Pete is useful to anyone who needs criminal contacts, black market goods, or discrete transportation. He'll deal with adventurers like he deals with everyone—professionally, profitably, and without asking questions he doesn't need answered.

### Current Situation
The Valdren blockade has been excellent for business. Smuggling is more profitable than ever, and Pete has positioned himself as the essential middleman between supply and demand. He's taking money from multiple factions while maintaining enough neutrality to survive—a balance that gets more precarious every week.

- Second-Story Work
- Fast Hands
- Supreme Sneak

## Species Traits
- Human Versatility

- **The Accounting:** A coded ledger of debts owed and favors given
- **Keys to the Kingdom:** Keys to every door and tunnel connected to the Rat
- **Emergency Bag:** Hidden beneath the bar—gold, fake identity papers, and poison for emergencies

### Resources
- Ownership of [[The Drowned Rat Tavern]]
- Network of smuggler contacts
- Payments from multiple factions
- Knowledge of the tunnel network beneath the Docks
- Enough blackmail material to destroy several careers

## Relationships

### To Protagonists
A useful but dangerous contact. Pete will deal with adventurers fairly—as long as "fairly" includes healthy profit margins. He can provide information, smuggler contacts, and discrete services, but trust should not extend beyond the transaction.

### Personal Life
- Never married—"Ships don't stay in harbor"
- No children he acknowledges (possibly several he doesn't)
- Drinks alone after closing, remembering the sea
- Has a comfortable nest egg hidden in multiple locations

### Enemies
- The City Watch (mutual understanding more than enmity)
- [[Captain Helena Stern]] (she knows what he is; can't prove it yet)
- Smugglers he's double-crossed over the years (several)
- The Valdren navy (old warrants never expire)

## Story Role

### Purpose
Pete represents the practical face of [[Eldoria]]'s underworld—criminal, but professional. He's a source of smuggler contacts, black market goods, and information about the city's darker side. He's neither ally nor enemy, just a businessman.

### Arc
His arc involves the increasing instability of his position. Playing all sides works until they compare notes. When the factions finally realize how much he's been taking from each of them, Pete will need to choose a side—or disappear entirely.

### Stakes
If Pete falls, the Drowned Rat loses its neutral status, and a significant portion of the Docks' underground economy falls into chaos. Someone else would fill the vacuum, but they might not maintain his careful balance.

### Complications
- [[Black Donal]] is getting suspicious about leaks to the authorities
- [[House Valdren]] is starting to wonder why the blockade has so many holes
- His coded ledger would be catastrophic if captured
- His health isn't what it was—the cough is getting worse

## Roleplay Notes

### Voice & Mannerisms
- Speaks in a gravelly voice with a heavy Eastern European accent
- Habit of polishing glasses while talking (watches reflections)
- Never looks directly at anyone—always appears to be looking elsewhere
- Laughs at his own jokes; they're never actually funny
- Tells different stories about his missing fingers

### Topics of Interest
- The sea (he misses it more than he admits)
- Ships and their captains
- The old smuggling days (romanticized in memory)
- The folly of faction politics

### Conversation Hooks
- "You look like you need something moved. Or maybe someone."
- "Information? I hear things. Whether I remember them depends on how much I want to."
- "The blockade? A temporary inconvenience. For those who know the way."

### Sample Dialogue

> "Friend, in my business, everyone's a friend until they're not. Let's make sure you stay in the first category."

> "You want to know about the Dock Runners? I don't know anything about the Dock Runners. I just pour drinks."

> "Twenty years on the water, fifteen more in this hole. I've outlived everyone who underestimated me. Think about that."

## Secrets

1. He's paid by [[House Valdren]] to report on blockade runners—and by the Dock Runners to facilitate them. He gives each side enough truth to keep them paying.

2. The tunnel network beneath the Rat connects to places even the Dock Runners don't know about—including a passage that emerges inside the noble quarter's walls.

3. He's smuggled three high-profile fugitives out of [[Eldoria]] in the past year—people whose disappearance embarrassed powerful factions. He never asks who or why; he just takes the gold.

### Portrait (Bust)
**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a retired smuggler and tavern keeper, human male, fifty-eight years old with every one of those years weathered into his face by salt and sun and harder things. A face of leather—literally leathered by decades at sea, creased and lined like a nautical chart of the routes he used to run. Pale grey eyes that see everything while appearing to look at nothing, perpetually squinting from years of watching horizons for revenue cutters. His most distinctive feature is his beard—grey and stiff with salt, deliberately maintained as part of his brand, bristling outward like the whiskers of his namesake rat. Hair receding and grey, cut short and practical. A nose that's been broken at least once, sitting above thin lips that know how to keep secrets. His left hand visible, showing the missing two fingers—the first knuckle and below, healed clean, the story changing each time someone asks. Wearing a heavy wool sweater with salt stains he never bothers removing, a leather apron over it that has more hidden pockets than visible ones. Expression of tired cynicism masking constant calculation—the look of a man who is always counting the room and computing profit margins. The hint of danger behind the weary eyes, the knowledge that he has a crossbow under the bar and has used it three times. Background: the interior of the Drowned Rat, the ship-timber bar behind him, bottles and shadows and the dim light of a place where questions aren't asked. Candlelight from below, casting deep shadows, the light of a place where visibility is deliberately poor.

## Notes
Saltbeard Pete represents the practical criminal—not violent by preference, not loyal by nature, just a businessman who deals in things that happen to be illegal. He's ideal for providing criminal contacts, smuggling services, and information about what's really happening in the Docks.
