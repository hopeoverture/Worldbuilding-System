# Ser Aldric Thorne

## Overview
Ser Aldric Thorne is the eldest son of Lady Margret Thorne and heir to the Eastern March. Where his mother is iron, Aldric is steel—just as strong but with more flexibility. He is a soldier's soldier, beloved by the troops he commands, respected by the lords who will one day answer to him, and haunted by the knowledge that his mother is dying and the succession crisis may force him to choose between honor and survival.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human
- **Age:** 38, in the prime of life
- **Height/Build:** 6'2", powerfully built, carries himself like a man who's worn armor since childhood
- **Skin/Eyes:** Weathered from campaigns, steel-gray eyes (his mother's)
- **Hair:** Dark brown, worn short and practical; beginning to gray at the temples
- **Distinguishing Features:** A network of small scars on his hands and forearms; moves with the economy of a trained fighter

### Attire
- **Military:** Well-worn but well-maintained plate armor with the Thorne sigil; practical rather than decorative
- **Court:** Dark formal wear with minimal ornamentation; uncomfortable in anything too fine

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Steady Honor:** Does what's right even when it's costly; the kind of man soldiers trust to lead them into danger
2. **Heavy Crown:** Already feels the weight of responsibility; takes his duties too seriously for his own peace

### Ideals
**Duty.** My mother gave everything for this house and this realm. I will not shame that legacy. When she's gone, I will hold what she held—and I will hold it with honor.

### Bonds
His mother is his North Star. He knows she's dying; he knows she's preparing him. Every conversation might be the last lesson. He will not waste them.

### Flaws
**Inflexibility.** Aldric's honor can become rigidity. He struggles with moral gray areas and may make enemies of potential allies because he cannot compromise principles that are, perhaps, less absolute than he believes.

### Motivations
Aldric wants to be worthy—worthy of his mother's legacy, worthy of his house's sacrifice in the Great War, worthy of the soldiers who follow him. He fears he isn't enough, that when the crisis comes, he'll fail. He buries this fear in duty.

## Background

### Military Career
Aldric has been a soldier since he could hold a sword. He fought in border skirmishes at seventeen, commanded his first company at twenty-two, and has spent the years since preparing for a war everyone knows is coming. He's competent, respected, and battle-tested—but he's never commanded an army, never faced a crisis like the succession.

### The Burden
Since his mother's illness, Aldric has taken on more and more responsibility. He handles military matters, maintains relations with the March lords, and prepares for the day when he must make the choice his mother has been building toward: peace under Valdren's puppet, or war for Thorne independence.

## Relationships

### Family
- **Mother:** [[Lady Margret Thorne]] — His commander, teacher, and example; watching her die is breaking him
- **Brother:** [[Ser Konrad Thorne]] — Trusts him completely; they complement each other
- **Brother:** [[Ser Viktor Thorne]] — Worries about Viktor's ambition; loves him anyway

### Allies
- **The March Lords:** Respect Aldric; will follow him when Margret is gone
- **The Forgemasters:** Good relations; Grimhild approves of him
- **Common Soldiers:** Love him; he remembers names and shares hardships

### Complicated
- **[[Edric Valdren]]** — The boy isn't his enemy, but his grandfather is
- **[[The Grey Wardens]]** — Aldric respects them; may ally with them against the rising dead

## Story Role

### Function
**Primary:** Military commander, honorable warrior, potential ally

**As an Ally:** Provides military support, legitimacy in the March, and a moral compass
**As an Enemy:** Commands the March's armies; formidable in battle

### Arc
Aldric must learn that honor isn't enough—sometimes you need cunning, compromise, or ruthlessness. His growth is about becoming a leader for the realm he's inheriting, not the one his mother conquered.

## Secrets

1. **He knows his mother suspects poison.** She hasn't told him who; he's investigating quietly.
2. **He's been approached by Valdren agents** offering alliance. He rejected them, but he kept it from his mother.
3. **He doubts himself.** At night, he wonders if he's ready. The answer scares him.
