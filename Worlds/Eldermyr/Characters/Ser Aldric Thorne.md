# Ser Aldric Thorne

## Overview
Ser Aldric Thorne is the eldest son of [[Lady Margret Thorne]] and heir to [[The Eastern March|the Eastern March]]. Where his mother is iron, Aldric is steel—just as strong but with more flexibility. He is a soldier's soldier, beloved by the troops he commands, respected by the lords who will one day answer to him, and haunted by the knowledge that his mother is dying and the succession crisis may force him to choose between honor and survival.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human
- **Age:** 38, in the prime of life
- **Height/Build:** 6'2", powerfully built, carries himself like a man who's worn armor since childhood
- **Skin/Eyes:** Weathered from campaigns, steel-gray eyes (his mother's)
- **Hair:** Dark brown, worn short and practical; beginning to gray at the temples
- **Distinguishing Features:** A network of small scars on his hands and forearms; moves with the economy of a trained fighter

### Attire
- **Military:** Well-worn but well-maintained plate armor with the Thorne sigil; practical rather than decorative
- **Court:** Dark formal wear with minimal ornamentation; uncomfortable in anything too fine

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Steady Honor:** Does what's right even when it's costly; the kind of man soldiers trust to lead them into danger
2. **Heavy Crown:** Already feels the weight of responsibility; takes his duties too seriously for his own peace

### Ideals
**Duty.** My mother gave everything for this house and this realm. I will not shame that legacy. When she's gone, I will hold what she held—and I will hold it with honor.

### Bonds
His mother is his North Star. He knows she's dying; he knows she's preparing him. Every conversation might be the last lesson. He will not waste them.

### Flaws
**Inflexibility.** Aldric's honor can become rigidity. He struggles with moral gray areas and may make enemies of potential allies because he cannot compromise principles that are, perhaps, less absolute than he believes.

### Motivations
Aldric wants to be worthy—worthy of his mother's legacy, worthy of his house's sacrifice in [[The Great War|the Great War]], worthy of the soldiers who follow him. He fears he isn't enough, that when the crisis comes, he'll fail. He buries this fear in duty.

## Background

### Military Career
Aldric has been a soldier since he could hold a sword. He fought in border skirmishes at seventeen, commanded his first company at twenty-two, and has spent the years since preparing for a war everyone knows is coming. He's competent, respected, and battle-tested—but he's never commanded an army, never faced a crisis like the succession.

### The Burden
Since his mother's illness, Aldric has taken on more and more responsibility. He handles military matters, maintains relations with [[The Eastern March|the March]] lords, and prepares for the day when he must make the choice his mother has been building toward: peace under Valdren's puppet, or war for Thorne independence.

### Arc
Aldric must learn that honor isn't enough—sometimes you need cunning, compromise, or ruthlessness. His growth is about becoming a leader for the realm he's inheriting, not the one his mother conquered.

## Secrets

1. **He knows his mother suspects poison.** She hasn't told him who; he's investigating quietly.
2. **He's been approached by [[House Valdren|Valdren]] agents** offering alliance. He rejected them, but he kept it from his mother.
3. **He doubts himself.** At night, he wonders if he's ready. The answer scares him.

## Image Prompts

### Portrait (Bust)
**Prompt:**
> Portrait bust of a human knight in his late thirties, male, powerfully built with a soldier's bearing—the kind of man soldiers trust to lead them into danger. Square honest face with strong bone structure inherited from his warrior mother. Broad forehead with a single horizontal worry line deepening as he ages, dark brown hair cut short and practical with gray beginning at the temples—premature for his age, the cost of responsibility. Thick straight eyebrows his mother's shape but darker, set low over deep-set steel-gray eyes—his mother's eyes exactly, the same fierce light but tempered with more kindness; fine lines at the corners from squinting into sun and wind. Straight blunt nose, broken once in training and healed slightly crooked—he never mentions it. Weathered cheekbones, neither high nor low, honest and dependable. Full lips often pressed together in thought, surrounded by stubble he forgets to shave on campaign. Strong square jaw, clean-lined and determined, the jaw of a man who keeps his word. Sun-weathered complexion, tanned and roughened from years of outdoor campaigning, with a network of small scars—nicks from training, one pale line across his right cheek from a glancing blow. Hands visible, scarred and calloused, the hands of a working soldier. Expression steady and dutiful, carrying the weight of responsibility, eyes showing the private doubt he never voices. Wearing well-worn plate armor with Thorne sigil (silver thorn crown on black). Background: blurred military camp. Cold northern light casting honest shadows on an honest face. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on weathered skin, practical scars, and the weight of duty, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy knight portrait.

### Full Body
**Prompt:**
> Full body portrait of the Iron Heir inspecting his troops at dawn in the Eastern March, human male in his late thirties, powerfully built at 6'2" with the bearing of a soldier who has worn armor since childhood. Square honest face with broad forehead, thick dark eyebrows, deep-set steel-gray eyes (his mother's legacy), straight slightly crooked nose, weathered cheekbones, full determined lips, strong square jaw. Sun-weathered complexion with network of small scars. Dark brown hair cut short with gray at the temples. Hands calloused and scarred from years of swordwork. Wearing well-worn but well-maintained plate armor, practical rather than decorative, the Thorne sigil displayed on his surcoat—silver thorn crown above crossed swords on black field. His longsword Thornfang Minor hangs at his hip, a heavy shield on his arm. He stands among his soldiers, not above them, one hand clasped on a veteran's shoulder, expression of steady encouragement. Around him, the military camp of the Eastern March awakens: tents in orderly rows, soldiers drilling, the Greycrown mountains visible in the cold morning light. His posture speaks of duty accepted without complaint, a good man preparing to lead in terrible times. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cold dawn lighting with mist, rich textures, intricate detail on weathered features, practical armor, and military brotherhood, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.
