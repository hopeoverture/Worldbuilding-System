# Ser Viktor Thorne

## Overview
Ser Viktor Thorne is the youngest son of [[Lady Margret Thorne]], and the one who most terrifies her. He has his mother's ambition, his father's charm, and none of his brothers' patience. Viktor is stationed at [[Aldersgate|the capital]] as [[House Thorne]]'s official representative, but his true purpose is more complex. He sees the succession crisis as an opportunity—and he's not certain his family's current path is the right one.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human
- **Age:** 32, in his prime
- **Height/Build:** 6'0", athletic and graceful; moves like a duelist
- **Skin/Eyes:** Fair, with the kind of handsomeness that opens doors; amber eyes (rare in the Thorne line, his grandmother's gift)
- **Hair:** Dark brown, worn longer and more fashionably than his brothers
- **Distinguishing Features:** A smile that lights up rooms; fingers that tap impatiently when bored; eyes that calculate while the mouth charms

### Attire
- **Court:** Fashionable and expensive; treads the line between Thorne austerity and capital style
- **Combat:** Light armor, elegant weapons; looks like he stepped out of a romance

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Charismatic Opportunist:** Genuinely charming, genuinely dangerous; makes friends easily and betrays them when necessary
2. **Impatient Ambition:** Third sons don't inherit; Viktor has always known he'd have to make his own fortune

### Ideals
**Advancement.** I love my family, but love doesn't change the order of succession. Aldric gets [[The Eastern March|the March]]. [[Ser Konrad Thorne|Konrad]] gets the forges. What do I get? Whatever I can take.

### Bonds
Despite everything, Viktor loves his brothers. He would never actively harm them. But surpass them? Replace them if they fall? Step over them if they stumble? That's just survival.

### Flaws
**Short-Sighted.** Viktor thinks in moves, not games. He's clever enough to see the opportunity but not wise enough to see the consequences. His schemes tend to work—until they don't.

### Motivations
Viktor wants to matter. He wants to be more than "the third son." He's not evil—he genuinely cares about his family and his house—but he's willing to make deals his brothers wouldn't consider. He's been approached by Valdren agents. He hasn't said no.

## Background

### The Youngest
Viktor grew up in his brothers' shadows. Aldric was the heir; [[Ser Konrad Thorne|Konrad]] was the useful one. Viktor became the diplomat, sent to courts where his charm could serve the family. He was good at it. But he also saw how the other houses played the game—and he started playing too.

### At Court
Viktor has been [[House Thorne]]'s representative in [[Aldersgate]] for five years. He's built a network of contacts, friends, and secrets. He knows things about [[Aldersgate]]'s power players that his family doesn't. He's been approached by multiple factions—Valdren, [[The Faith of the Three]], even whispers from Karath. He's kept all options open.

## Relationships

### Family
- **Mother:** [[Lady Margret Thorne]] — Loves and fears her; knows she's disappointed in him
- **Brother:** [[Ser Aldric Thorne]] — Respects but resents; Aldric got to be the hero
- **Brother:** [[Ser Konrad Thorne]] — Underestimates; doesn't realize [[Ser Konrad Thorne|Konrad]] watches him

### Connections at Court

- **Faith contacts** — Has friends among the bishops; information flows both ways
- **Noble sons and daughters** — Popular at parties; knows everyone's secrets

### Potential Enemies
- His own family, if they discover his negotiations
- Whoever he ultimately betrays

## Story Role

### Function
**Primary:** Courtier, potential traitor, moral wildcard

**As an Ally:** Provides court intelligence, social access, and charm
**As an Enemy:** Has information on the party; can turn allies against them

### Arc
Viktor stands at a crossroads. He can embrace his family, accept his role, and serve honorably—or he can chase his ambitions into darkness. The party might influence his choice.

### Possible Outcomes
- **Redemption:** Chooses family when it counts; becomes the brother he should have been
- **Betrayal:** Makes a deal that destroys his house; lives with the consequences
- **Tragic:** Tries to have it both ways; loses everything

## Secrets

1. **He's been negotiating with Valdren.** Not treason—yet—but he's exploring options. Marco Valdren has made promises.
2. **He knows about his mother's illness** more than his brothers think. He's been quietly investigating treatments—and inheritances.
3. **He loves his family.** This is his deepest secret. He genuinely loves Aldric and [[Ser Konrad Thorne|Konrad]], and he's terrified of what he might do anyway.
4. **He's been approached by Karath agents too.** He rejected them—whatever [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] is offering feels wrong—but the offer was made.
