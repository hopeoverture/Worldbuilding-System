# Shaman Masha Bloodmoon

## Overview

Shaman Masha Bloodmoon is the spiritual leader of [[Stahlburg]]'s orc community, keeper of traditions that predate human contact and guide to a people struggling to maintain their identity in a foreign land. Where [[Warchief Grokmar Ironjaw]] handles military and political matters, Masha tends to the souls of Grünholm's orcs—their births and deaths, their marriages and mourning, their connection to ancestors who watch from beyond.

At 63, Masha is old for an orc—old enough to remember life before [[The Great War]], old enough to have seen her people scattered and reformed, old enough to know what is lost when traditions die. This memory drives her work: preserving orc ways while adapting enough to survive among humans.

## Appearance

Masha is weathered and lean, her grey-green skin marked with ritual scars and painted symbols that she refreshes daily. Her white hair is worn in traditional orc braids, each braid marking a significant spiritual achievement. Her eyes are milky with the beginnings of cataracts, but orcs say she sees more clearly than the young.

She wears traditional orc garb—leathers and furs marked with ancestral symbols—even when such dress draws stares from humans. A necklace of bone and stone holds the teeth of every shaman who preceded her, dating back seven generations.

## Personality

Masha is fierce in defense of orc traditions and gentle with those who struggle to maintain them. She understands that her people face impossible choices—become human enough to survive, or remain orc enough to be worth surviving. She tries to find paths between these extremes.

She mistrusts human religion intensely. [[The Faith of the Three]] has no place for orc ancestors, orc spirits, or orc ways of knowing. She has seen what happens when orcs convert—they lose themselves, becoming neither human nor orc. She considers this a spiritual death.

## Spiritual Role

### Keeper of Traditions
Masha maintains the orc rituals that have survived displacement: the naming ceremonies, the warrior rites, the ancestor calls, the death songs. She trains young orcs in these practices, fighting against the erosion of each generation's connection to the old ways.

### Voice of Ancestors
Through ritual and trance, Masha communes with orc ancestors—spirits of the dead who offer guidance to the living. Human priests call this necromancy; orcs call it family. The ancestors tell Masha things: warnings about the future, wisdom about the present, judgments about the living.

### Healer and Counselor
Grünholm orcs bring their troubles to Masha—spiritual troubles, family troubles, troubles they can't share with [[Warchief Grokmar Ironjaw|Grokmar]]. She offers healing (both physical and spiritual), advice, and the comfort of being understood by someone who shares their struggles.

### Guardian of Sacred Space
Within Grünholm, Masha maintains a small shrine—the Ancestor Hall—where orc traditions are practiced openly. This space is protected by agreement with [[House Thorne]], who understand that useful mercenaries need their morale maintained.

## Concerns and Tensions

### Cultural Erosion
Each generation of Grünholm orcs becomes more human. Young orcs speak Common more comfortably than Orc. They dream of human careers, human goods, human comforts. Masha sees her traditions dying—not in dramatic persecution but in quiet forgetting.

### Conflict with Grokmar
Masha and [[Warchief Grokmar Ironjaw|Grokmar]] respect each other but disagree fundamentally. He believes orcs survive through integration; she believes integration is slow death. They present unity to outsiders but argue fiercely in private.

### The Faith's Pressure
[[The Faith of the Three]]'s priests consider orc practices heresy. So far, [[House Thorne]]'s protection has kept missionaries out of Grünholm. But if Thorne's power wanes, or if the priests find an excuse, Masha's shrine could be destroyed and her practices outlawed.

### The Rising Dead
The curse from [[The Ashen Fields]] troubles Masha deeply. The ancestors speak of something ancient waking, something that corrupts the relationship between living and dead. The human priests blame necromancy; Masha knows this is different—and worse.

## The Bloodmoon Line

Masha comes from a line of shamans stretching back before orcs came to these lands. Her grandmother crossed the mountains fleeing a disaster the old stories won't name. Her mother established the first orc community in what would become Grünholm. Masha continues this legacy of survival through adaptation.

She has no children—shamans of her tradition sacrifice personal family for the family of all orcs. But she has trained three apprentices, and the strongest, a young woman named Grisha, will likely succeed her.

## Abilities

Masha is a spiritual leader, not a warrior, but her connection to the ancestors grants her power:

- **Cleric (Ancestor Domain)** or **Druid** equivalent, approximately level 7
- Specializes in divination, healing, and speaking with dead
- Can call upon ancestors for guidance (functions as *augury* and *commune*)
- Can bless warriors before battle (+1 to attack rolls for 1 hour)
- Can perform death rites that ensure proper passage to the ancestors

**In combat:** Masha avoids fighting directly. She provides healing, curses enemies, and calls upon ancestors to strengthen orc warriors. If cornered, she has a ritual dagger and the desperation of someone who knows her death would devastate her community.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Ancestors' Warning:** The ancestors have shown Masha a vision of disaster for Grünholm. She needs outsiders to investigate a threat her people cannot face alone—and she cannot explain why to Grokmar without revealing how dire the warning was.

2. **The Lost Tradition:** Masha knows of an orc holy site in the mountains, abandoned when her grandmother's people fled. Recovering artifacts from this site could strengthen orc traditions—but reaching it means crossing dangerous territory.

3. **The Conversion Crisis:** A young orc has converted to [[The Faith of the Three]], and missionaries are using this success to push for more conversions. Masha needs help showing young orcs the value of their own traditions without creating a religious conflict that could destroy Grünholm's protection.

4. **The Death Rite:** An orc of importance has died, but his body was lost in battle. Without proper rites, his spirit cannot join the ancestors. Masha needs help recovering the body—or performing the rite in the place where he fell.
