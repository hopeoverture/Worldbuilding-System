# The Mad King

## Overview
Valdus Karath was the High King of Eldermyr whose tyranny sparked [[The Great War]]. He began as an ambitious but capable ruler, slowly descended into paranoia and madness, and eventually embraced forbidden necromancy to maintain his power. He was killed by his own son, Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] the Liberator, at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. But the figure that walks the battlefield today, wearing a crown of blackened iron, suggests death was not the end.

## History

### The Ascension
Valdus took the throne at age 30, inheriting a prosperous realm. He was ambitious, intelligent, and initially popular. He expanded trade, strengthened defenses, and seemed destined to be a great king.

### The Change
Something changed in Valdus around his 40th year. Some say he discovered forbidden texts. Others claim he heard voices from beneath the earth. He became paranoid, seeing traitors everywhere. He began purging nobles he suspected of disloyalty.

### The Descent
As his paranoia grew, Valdus turned to darker methods. He consulted with hedge wizards, then necromancers, then things that were not human at all. He created [[The Blackened Crown]], a mockery of [[The Iron Crown]], to grant him power over death. He believed he would live forever.

### The Tyranny
In his final years, Valdus was barely human. He demanded "tribute" of living prisoners for his rituals. Entire villages were emptied. His own son fled to lead the rebellion against him. The realm united against their king.

### The Fall
At [[The Battle of Ashen Fields|the Battle of Ashen Fields]], Valdus made his final stand with an army of the living and the dead. When his son Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] faced him in single combat, witnesses reported that Valdus was no longer speaking with his own voice. [[The Unnamed]] had claimed him. [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] killed the body, but something escaped.

## The Figure

### Current Status
For twenty-three years, Valdus was believed truly dead. But in the last year, a figure has been seen at the heart of [[The Ashen Fields]]—tall, in rotting royal robes, wearing a crown of blackened iron. It resembles Valdus. It may be Valdus, preserved by [[The Blackened Crown]]. Or it may be [[The Unnamed]] wearing his corpse as a mask.

### Behavior
The Figure does not leave [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]. It walks among the mass graves, and the dead rise and follow. It does not speak, but those who see it hear its voice in their dreams. It is waiting for something. Or preparing for something.

### Connection to [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]
[[Lord Draven Karath]] has dreamed of the Figure for a year. It speaks to him with his grandfather's voice, promising restoration, power, revenge. [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] does not know if it is truly Valdus or something else. He is beginning not to care.

## Personality (In Life)

### Before the Madness
Valdus was ambitious, charismatic, and ruthless—but not cruel. He wanted to be a great king, to expand the realm, to be remembered. He was impatient with weakness but rewarded loyalty.

### After the Change
The paranoid Valdus saw enemies everywhere. He trusted no one—not his advisors, not his wife, eventually not even his children. He spoke to himself. He stayed awake for days. He became convinced that only absolute power could protect him.

### At the End
The Valdus at Ashen Fields was barely human. Witnesses describe glowing eyes, a voice that echoed strangely, movements that were too smooth or too jerky. [[The Unnamed]] had already claimed him. What [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] killed was a puppet whose master escaped.

## Family

- **Wife:** Queen Elena Karath (died in the war, officially illness, possibly murdered)
- **Son:** Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] the Liberator (killed him, died in the process)
- **Grandson:** [[Lord Draven Karath]] (child survivor, current head of house)
- **Great-Grandchildren:** [[Aleksei Karath]] ([[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s son), [[Yelena Karath]] ([[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s sister)

## Secrets

1. **He Made Contact.** Valdus deliberately sought out [[The Unnamed|the Unnamed]]. He found references in ancient texts and performed rituals to make contact. He thought he was bargaining for power. He was wrong.

2. **He's Still Aware.** If the Figure is Valdus, he is aware but not in control. [[The Unnamed]] uses his memories, his knowledge, his hatred—but Valdus himself is a prisoner in his own corpse.

3. **He Left Instructions.** Before [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], Valdus hid documents detailing his rituals, his contact with [[The Unnamed]], and his plans for the realm. These documents are hidden in [[Chernogrod]]. [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has not found them—yet.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Grandfather's Voice:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] seeks proof that the Figure is truly Valdus. If it is, does that change anything? If it isn't, what has been speaking to him?

2. **The Final Words:** Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s hidden letter describes what Valdus said before he died. Finding it might reveal how to truly end him.

3. **Release Him:** If Valdus is aware but imprisoned, he might want to truly die. A party might need to free the man to destroy the monster.
