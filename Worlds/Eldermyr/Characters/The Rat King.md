# The Rat King

## Overview
The Rat King is a phantom, a legend, a name whispered in the Warrens and feared throughout [[Eldoria]]. No one knows their face; no one knows their voice; orders come through intermediaries, and those who fail those orders disappear. They control the largest thieves' guild in the capital, running everything from pickpockets to high-society burglary. What no one suspects—what would shake the foundations of the realm if known—is that the Rat King is actually Sera Thorne, youngest sibling of [[Lady Margret Thorne]], using the criminal underworld to advance her family's claim to the throne.

## The Legend

### Public Knowledge
The Rat King is:
- Master of the Warrens Guild, the largest thieves' operation in [[Eldoria]]
- Never seen in person; communicates only through intermediaries
- Supposedly operating from the Sinking House in the Warrens
- Ruthlessly efficient; failures are not tolerated
- Expanding operations during the succession crisis

### What The Underworld Knows
- The Rat King has been in power for about seven years
- They eliminated the previous guild leadership in a single night
- Their intelligence network rivals any faction's
- They've been systematically taking over smaller criminal operations
- They have protection that extends beyond what coin should buy

### The Truth
Sera Thorne arrived in [[Eldoria]] seven years ago, officially estranged from her family after a scandal involving a minor noble's son. In reality, her "disgrace" was carefully orchestrated to place a Thorne asset where [[House Thorne]] needed one—in the capital's criminal underworld. She built the Rat King identity from scratch, eliminating the disorganized gangs and creating a professional organization that serves both criminal enterprise and Thorne interests.

## True Appearance

### Physical Description (Sera Thorne)
Sera is thirty-one years old, with the sharp features and steel-grey eyes that mark all the Thornes. She's lean and hard, trained in combat like all her siblings, but lacking the bulk of her warrior brothers. Her brown hair is kept practical and forgettable; her face is pleasant but unremarkable—she cultivated anonymity deliberately. When she needs to, she can be beautiful; most of the time, she chooses to be invisible.

### The Rat King Persona
When operating as the Rat King, Sera uses multiple layers of disguise:
- A male voice (magical item)
- Heavy robes that conceal all physical features
- A distinctive rat-skull mask (for the rare occasions intermediaries see "him")
- Different heights achieved through lifts and posture
- The cultivation of multiple conflicting descriptions

### Attire
As Sera: Simple, middle-class clothing that attracts no attention
As the Rat King: Heavy black robes, the rat-skull mask, gloves always

## Personality

### Traits
1. She thinks three moves ahead, planning contingencies for contingencies
2. She genuinely enjoys the game—the deception, the manipulation, the slow accumulation of power

### Ideals
**Family First:** "The Thornes bled for this realm. We earned the throne in blood. The criminals, the spies, the dirty work—it's all for my family's rightful place."

### Bonds
Her loyalty is absolute—to [[House Thorne]] and specifically to her mother [[Lady Margret Thorne]]. Everything she does serves the family, even the crimes.

### Flaws
She's become so immersed in the Rat King identity that she sometimes loses herself in it. The power is intoxicating, and she's not sure she wants to give it up even if Thorne wins the throne.

### Demeanor
As Sera Thorne (rarely seen): Quiet, forgettable, the kind of person you'd pass without noticing
As the Rat King: Cold, efficient, speaking through intermediaries with absolute authority

## Role

### Function
**Primary:** Hidden Antagonist / Faction Asset

**Secondary:** Information Broker (unwittingly serving Thorne)

### Expertise
- Thieves' guild operations and management
- Intelligence gathering and analysis
- Blackmail and manipulation
- Sabotage and assassination (through agents)
- The layout of the Warrens and its criminal networks

### Availability
- The Rat King never meets anyone in person
- Messages go through dead drops and intermediaries
- The Sinking House is the official headquarters (Sera is rarely there)
- Sera herself lives in a comfortable townhouse in the Merchant's Ring under an assumed name

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Noble (secret)

**Occupation:** Crime Lord (cover for family intelligence operative)

**Path:** Sera was trained alongside her brothers in combat and strategy, but her true talent was for deception. When [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Thorne]] needed an asset in [[Eldoria]], Sera volunteered for the "disgrace" that would free her to operate without noble constraints. Seven years of careful work built the Rat King from nothing.

### History with Protagonists
Adventurers might encounter the Rat King's operations, be hired by intermediaries for criminal work, or investigate the guild's activities. They'll never meet "him" directly—but they might meet Sera Thorne without knowing who she really is.

### Current Situation
The succession crisis is both opportunity and danger. Sera is using guild resources to gather intelligence for [[House Thorne]], sabotage rival factions, and position her family for victory. But her growing criminal empire has attracted attention—[[Captain Helena Stern]] is getting close, and [[Lady Whisper]] knows more than she should.

- Secret support from [[House Thorne]]

## Relationships

### To Protagonists
Potential hidden antagonist, employer (through intermediaries), or unwitting contact (as Sera). The revelation of her identity would be a major campaign moment.

### Personal Life
- **True Family:** [[Lady Margret Thorne]] (mother), [[Ser Aldric Thorne]], [[Ser Konrad Thorne]], [[Ser Viktor Thorne]] (brothers)—they know the truth
- **Cover Life:** Lives as "Sara Vale," a widow of modest means in the Merchant's Ring
- No romantic attachments—too dangerous
- Genuinely fond of some guild members (complicating her mission)

### Enemies
- [[Captain Helena Stern]] (getting close to the truth)
- [[Lady Whisper]] (knows too much)
- [[House Valdren]] (family enemy; unaware of her role)
- Rival criminal organizations

## Story Role

### Purpose
The Rat King is a hidden antagonist whose revelation would reshape understanding of the Thorne faction. Discovering that the criminal underworld is a Thorne asset raises the stakes and complicates the political situation dramatically.

### Arc
Her arc involves the tension between her criminal identity and her family loyalty. As the Rat King, she's built something of her own—something that might not want to be dissolved when Thorne wins. She must choose between the throne for her family and the empire she's created.

### Stakes
If the Rat King's identity is revealed, [[House Thorne]]'s reputation is devastated. Their claim to honor and martial virtue collapses if their youngest sibling is running thieves' operations. The revelation could end Thorne's bid for the throne.

### Complications
- [[Captain Helena Stern]] has identified patterns suggesting guild leadership has noble connections
- [[Lady Whisper]] has deduced more than she's revealed
- Some guild members are becoming loyal to "the King" over the abstract family
- Her brothers don't know the extent of what she's done

## Roleplay Notes

### Voice & Mannerisms (As Rat King)
- Speaks through intermediaries; rarely uses even the disguised voice
- Messages are terse, professional, absolute
- Failure is met with swift, certain consequence
- No unnecessary cruelty; efficiency only

### Voice & Mannerisms (As Sera/Sara)
- Quiet, pleasant, forgettable
- Excellent listener; asks the right questions
- Never draws attention to herself
- Can adopt multiple personas flawlessly

### Topics of Interest
- Criminal operations (professionally)
- Intelligence and information (professionally)
- Her family's honor (secretly)
- The succession crisis (obliquely)

### Conversation Hooks
*As Rat King (through intermediary):*
- "The King requires a service. The payment will be generous. The alternative will not."
- "Your success or failure determines your future. Choose wisely."

*As Sera/Sara:*
- "I'm just a quiet woman trying to make her way. Nothing interesting about me."
- "Politics? I don't follow such things. Too complicated for simple folk."

## Secrets

1. Her true identity: She is Sera Thorne, youngest sibling of [[Lady Margret Thorne]], operating the criminal underworld to advance her family's claim to the throne.

2. She has compiled intelligence files on every major player in [[Eldoria]]—including her own family. She tells herself this is for security, but part of her enjoys knowing she could destroy anyone.

3. She's fallen in love with a guild lieutenant who knows her only as the Rat King. The relationship is impossible, but she can't end it.

### Portrait: The Rat King
**Prompt:**
Portrait of the legendary Rat King, the phantom ruler of Eldoria's thieves' guild, shown in the rare moments when intermediaries glimpse "his" presence. A figure shrouded in heavy black robes that pool on the floor, concealing all physical features—height, build, gender, everything hidden beneath layers of dark fabric. The face is covered by a distinctive rat skull mask, actual bone or carved to appear so, the empty eye sockets filled with shadow, the elongated incisors yellowed and sharp. Only gloved hands are visible, thin black leather that could belong to anyone. The robes have a high collar that conceals even the neck, the hood pulled forward to shadow whatever might be seen behind the mask. The overall impression is of darkness given form, a shadow that has learned to walk and command. Seated on a throne-like chair made of salvaged wood in a basement somewhere—the Sinking House, they say—with candles guttering in the background and rats visible in the shadows, watching with the same intelligence as their king. The atmosphere is dread and power, the sense that you are being judged by something that knows all your secrets and has decided your fate before you spoke. No skin visible. No identifying features. Only the mask and the authority it represents. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, dramatic candlelight from below creating deep shadows, rich textures on aged bone and dark fabric, dramatic atmosphere of criminal underworld power, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.

### Portrait: Sera Thorne (True Identity)
**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of Sera Thorne, youngest of the Thorne siblings, thirty-one years old with the sharp features and steel-grey eyes that mark her family's bloodline—but trained to be forgotten. A lean, hard face with the bone structure of nobility deliberately softened by hairstyle and expression, the kind of pleasant features that slide from memory moments after seeing them. Steel-grey eyes that hold the same cold calculation as her warrior brothers, but hidden behind a mask of middling-class pleasantness. Brown hair kept practical and forgettable, neither styled nor plain, the hair of someone who doesn't want to be remembered. A face that can be beautiful when she needs it to be and invisible when she doesn't—she's practiced both in mirrors. Wearing simple middle-class clothing, a widow's practical dress in muted colors, the costume of "Sara Vale" that she wears in public. But in this portrait, something of the truth shows through—the set of the jaw that belongs to [[House Thorne]], the coldness in the eyes that has ordered deaths, the coiled tension of someone who is always playing a role. Expression of pleasant neutrality that, if you look closely, never quite reaches those calculating eyes. No visible weapons or guild symbols—she's too careful for that. Background: a modest townhouse interior, comfortable but unremarkable, the cover life she's constructed with the same care she builds schemes. Soft afternoon light through curtained windows, the light of respectability hiding something darker. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on a face trained for anonymity, dramatic atmosphere of hidden identity, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy noblewoman spy portrait illustration.

## Notes
The Rat King is designed as a major reveal—the discovery that [[House Thorne]]'s youngest sibling has been running [[Eldoria]]'s criminal underworld. This connects the political intrigue to the criminal elements and dramatically complicates the succession crisis. The revelation should be earned through investigation rather than given freely.
