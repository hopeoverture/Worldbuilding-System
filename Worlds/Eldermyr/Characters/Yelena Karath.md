# Yelena Karath

## Overview
Yelena Karath is Lord Draven's younger sister, House Karath's spymistress, and the one who truly understands what her brother has bargained with. Where Draven channels The Unnamed's power through rage and will, Yelena approaches it through knowledge and patience. She is deeper into the darkness than even Draven realizes—and she's not certain she wants to come back.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Species:** Human, with pronounced corruption
- **Age:** 42, but the corruption makes her age hard to determine; sometimes looks thirty, sometimes looks sixty
- **Height/Build:** 5'6", unnaturally thin; doesn't seem to eat much anymore
- **Skin/Eyes:** Pale as bone; eyes are pale gray, almost colorless, and seem to see things that aren't there
- **Hair:** Prematurely white, worn long and loose; sometimes moves when there's no wind
- **Distinguishing Features:** Whispers to herself constantly; doesn't cast a shadow in certain light; hands are always cold

### Attire
- **Typical:** Black and gray robes, always hooded; silver jewelry inscribed with symbols she claims are protective
- **The Watcher's Eye:** An amulet she never removes; allows her to scry on the Ashen Fields

### Presence
Yelena feels wrong. Even those without magical sensitivity notice something off about her—a chill in the air, a sense of being watched, a sudden urge to leave. Animals flee her. Children cry. The faithful feel genuine fear. She has learned to use this, but it makes normal human connection impossible.

## Personality

### Traits
1. **Cold Curiosity:** Studies everything, including horror, with the detachment of a scholar dissecting a specimen
2. **Protective Possession:** Everything she does is ultimately for House Karath; her corruption is a sacrifice, not a surrender

### Ideals
**Knowledge.** Power comes from understanding. My brother rages at our enemies; I learn their secrets. He bargained with The Unnamed for strength; I bargained for knowledge. One of us made the better deal.

### Bonds
Her nephew Aleksei is the future of House Karath. Yelena watches over him—perhaps too closely. She sees potential in the boy that frightens and excites her.

### Flaws
**Addiction to Power.** Yelena has gone too far to stop. Each communion with The Unnamed gives her more knowledge, more power, more understanding—and costs her more of her humanity. She knows this. She can't stop.

### Motivations
Yelena wants to understand. Not just The Unnamed, but everything—the nature of death, the structure of the cosmos, the secrets that hide behind reality. She tells herself this is for House Karath's restoration. But increasingly, the knowledge is its own reward.

## Villainy

### Methods
- **Scrying and Surveillance:** Watches enemies through the Watcher's Eye; knows secrets no one should know
- **Dream Invasion:** Can enter dreams of those she's met; implants suggestions, extracts information
- **The Spy Network:** Runs House Karath's intelligence operations; agents in every major court
- **Dark Communion:** Regularly consults The Unnamed; receives prophecies and guidance

### Crimes
1. **Deeper pact with The Unnamed than Draven knows** — She's further gone than her brother
2. **Murder through magic** — At least a dozen enemies killed through curses, dreams, and worse
3. **Corrupting influence on Aleksei** — Teaching him things he's too young to know
4. **Actively feeding information to The Unnamed** — What she learns, it learns

### Justification
"My brother thinks he's using The Unnamed. He's wrong, but he doesn't need to know that yet. What matters is that House Karath survives—that Aleksei inherits something worth having. If I have to sacrifice my soul for that, so be it. Someone has to understand what we're dealing with. Someone has to become what's necessary. I volunteer."

## Background

### Early Life
Yelena was always the clever sibling. While Draven nursed his hatred, she studied—first conventional magic, then darker arts. The Mad King's legacy included a library of forbidden texts; Yelena found them. She was already halfway to corruption before Draven made his bargain.

### The Second Pact
When Draven told her about The Unnamed, Yelena wasn't horrified. She was fascinated. She made her own approach, her own bargain. Where Draven wanted power, she wanted knowledge. The Unnamed gave her both—and she gave it access to her mind.

### Current Status
Yelena is the shadow behind Draven's throne. She runs the spy network, counsels on magical matters, and serves as liaison with The Unnamed in ways Draven doesn't fully understand. She's also watching Aleksei, preparing him for a future her brother can't imagine.

## Equipment

### The Watcher's Eye
An amulet of black iron and silver, inscribed with The Unnamed's symbols. Grants at-will scrying on the Ashen Fields and advantage on divination spells.

### Ritual Components
Yelena carries an extensive kit of components for dark rituals, divination, and communion with The Unnamed.

### Resources
- House Karath's spy network
- Access to forbidden texts
- Direct line to The Unnamed's knowledge

## Relationships

### Family
- **Brother:** [[Lord Draven Karath]] — Loves him; serves him; knows he doesn't understand what they've become
- **Nephew:** Aleksei Karath — Her project; she's preparing him for something
- **Late Family:** Remembers them all; the hatred keeps her warm

### The Unnamed
Yelena's relationship with The Unnamed is more complex than Draven's. She treats it as a patron, a teacher, and a puzzle to be solved. It treats her as... useful.

### Enemies
- Everyone Draven opposes
- Anyone who threatens Aleksei
- Reality itself, increasingly

## Story Role

### Function
**Primary:** Spymistress, occult advisor, true threat behind Draven

**Threat Level:** Regional, potentially catastrophic—she knows things that could accelerate The Unnamed's awakening

### Arc
Yelena's arc is about the price of knowledge. She wanted to understand; now she understands too much. Her redemption (if possible) would require accepting that some knowledge isn't worth the cost—and that she still has something human worth saving.

### As an Ally (Conditional)
If somehow turned, Yelena could provide:
- Intelligence on The Unnamed's nature and weaknesses
- Insider knowledge of Karath plans
- Powerful divination and occult support

### As an Enemy
- Near-perfect intelligence on the party
- Dream attacks and scrying
- Powerful curse magic
- Will sacrifice anything for House Karath

## Secrets

1. **She's further gone than Draven.** He thinks he made the deeper bargain. He's wrong. Yelena has given The Unnamed access to her senses; it sees through her eyes.

2. **She knows The Unnamed's true nature.** She's pieced together what it is—or was—before it was bound. The knowledge terrifies her. She hasn't told Draven.

3. **She's preparing Aleksei.** Not to succeed Draven as a normal heir, but as something else. She's not sure what yet; The Unnamed is guiding her.

4. **Part of her wants to stop.** Deep down, the woman Yelena used to be is screaming. But the knowledge is so beautiful, and the power is so useful, and it's too late anyway...
