# Magic of Eldermyr

> *"Magic is not a gift. It is a debt you pay with your own flesh, your own years, your own sanity. Those who think otherwise have never cast a spell that mattered."*
> — Attributed to Archmage Valdros the Grey

## Overview

Magic in Eldermyr is rare, powerful, and dangerous. Perhaps one person in a thousand carries the spark—and of those, most never develop it beyond hedge-tricks and minor cantrips. True practitioners are remarkable figures: valued by lords, watched by the [[The Faith of the Three|Faith]], and viewed with a mix of awe and fear by common folk.

Magic draws from multiple sources—divine grace, inherited blood, rigorous study, communion with spirits, or darker bargains—but all magic shares one truth: it costs. Power is not free. The Art demands payment in exhaustion, components, years of life, or pieces of the soul. Those who forget this lesson do not practice magic for long.

Since [[The Mad King]]'s fall twenty-three years ago, the realm views magic with renewed suspicion. His dark rituals broke something that was better left whole. Now the dead stir in [[The Ashen Fields]], and [[The Faith of the Three]] hunts forbidden practitioners with renewed zeal.

## Classification

### Types of Magic

Magic in Eldermyr falls into five broad traditions, each with its own source, methods, and social standing:

| Tradition | Source | Status | Practitioners |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Divine** | Granted by [[The Faith of the Three\]] | Respected | Priests, Confessors |
| **Bloodline** | Inherited magical ancestry | Tolerated | Noble Sorcerers |
| **Academic** | Rigorous study and discipline | Distrusted | Wizards, Scholars |
| **Spirit** | Communion with the dead | Suspicious | Wise Women, Mediums |
| **Forbidden** | Demonic pacts, necromancy | Hunted | Warlocks, Necromancers |

### Underlying Mechanics

All magic, regardless of tradition, operates on certain shared principles:

**Life Force:** Magic draws from the caster's vitality. Minor spells tire; major workings can leave a mage bedridden for days or take years from their life. This is why most practitioners live shorter lives than common folk, despite their power.

**Runic Foundation:** Complex magic requires symbols, inscriptions, and wards. The [[The Ashen Fields]] were bound by runic seals for twenty years. Those seals are failing now.

**Component Cost:** Most magic requires material components—herbs, minerals, preserved organs, rare metals. This keeps the Art expensive and limits who can practice it seriously.

## Mechanics

### Fundamental Principles

Magic reshapes reality through will, knowledge, and sacrifice. The caster imposes their desire on the world, paying for the change with their own life force and whatever components the working requires. The greater the effect, the greater the cost. There are no shortcuts—only debts deferred or paid by others.

### Accessing Magic by Tradition

**Divine Magic:**
- Accessed through prayer, ritual, and devotion to [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]
- Requires ordination and genuine faith
- Power flows from the gods through the practitioner
- Limited by doctrine—[[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] do not grant power for forbidden works

**Bloodline Magic:**
- Manifests instinctively, often in childhood
- Cannot be taught to those without the blood
- Inherited memory sometimes provides ancestral knowledge through dreams
- Different bloodlines carry different affinities

**Academic Magic:**
- Learned through years of study with a master or from rare texts
- Requires natural aptitude plus discipline
- Most structured and understood form of magic
- Knowledge is hoarded and rarely shared freely

**Spirit Magic:**
- Accessed through communion with ancestral spirits or the dead
- Taught through dream instruction and oral traditions
- Walks a gray line between honored tradition and forbidden necromancy
- Growing more powerful—and more dangerous—as the [[The Ashen Fields]] stir

**Forbidden Magic:**
- Accessed through pacts with demonic entities
- Or through necromantic rituals that violate the dead
- Power is quick and potent—but the costs are hidden at first
- Always corrupts the practitioner

### Casting Methods

**Verbal Components:** Most magic requires spoken words—invocations, prayers, true names, or words of power. Silent casting is possible for masters but extremely difficult.

**Somatic Components:** Gestures, hand signs, and ritual movements focus magical energy. Bound or restrained mages have difficulty casting.

**Material Components:** Herbs, minerals, blood, rare substances. Academic magic is particularly dependent on components. Divine magic often substitutes holy symbols.

**Focus Items:** Staves, wands, orbs, holy symbols. Not strictly required, but they reduce strain and improve control.

**Ritual Requirements:** Major workings require hours or days of preparation, specific locations, astronomical timing, or multiple participants.

### Schools of Magic

**Sanctioned Schools:**
| School | Effects | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Healing** | Mending wounds, curing disease, removing poison | Honored, taught by Faith |
| **Divination** | Seeing truth, past, future, hidden things | Valued, carefully watched |
| **Alchemy** | Potions, salves, material transmutation | Respectable trade |
| **Warding** | Protection, barriers, seals, abjuration | High demand |
| **Artifice** | Creating enchanted items | Rare, prestigious |

**Distrusted Schools:**
| School | Effects | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Illusion** | False sensory experiences | "Liars with power" |
| **Enchantment** | Affecting emotions and thoughts | Borders on forbidden |
| **Transmutation** | Changing one thing to another | Unsettling |
| **Pyromancy** | Fire magic | Valuable in war, dangerous in peace |
| **Geomancy** | Earth and stone magic | Old ways, tolerated |

**Rare Schools:**
| School | Effects | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Druidism** | Nature communion | Rural, distrusted by Faith |
| **Electromancy** | Storm and lightning | Rare, dramatic |
| **Telepathy** | Mental communication | Very rare bloodline gift |

**Forbidden Schools:**
| School | Effects | Punishment |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Necromancy** | Animating or contacting dead | Death by burning |
| **Summoning** | Calling entities from beyond | Death by burning |
| **Binding** | Trapping spirits | Death by burning |
| **Biomancy** | Shaping flesh | Imprisonment or death |

### Power Levels

**Cantrips/Minor Effects:**
- Light, minor healing, small flames, simple divination
- Tiring but not dangerous
- Most practitioners never exceed this level

**Moderate Effects:**
- Serious healing, battle magic, useful enchantments
- Requires significant rest afterward
- The level of a competent professional

**Major Effects:**
- Raising wards over buildings, powerful combat magic, complex rituals
- Days of recovery; possible permanent cost
- Master-level work

**Legendary Effects:**
- Sealing an entire battlefield (the [[The Ashen Fields]] wards)
- Moving through space instantly
- Binding or banishing powerful entities
- Years of life or death of the caster
- Perhaps a handful of living practitioners could attempt such things

## Costs & Limitations

### Energy Cost

All magic exacts a price:
- **Minor Casting:** Tiredness equivalent to hard labor
- **Moderate Casting:** Exhaustion requiring hours of rest
- **Major Casting:** Days bedridden; possible lasting fatigue
- **Legendary Casting:** Years of life; permanent damage; death

### Absolute Limitations

What magic CANNOT do in Eldermyr:

| Limitation | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **True Resurrection** | Death is final. Undead are not alive. |
| **Immortality** | All things die. Life can be extended, but not forever. |
| **Time Travel** | The past cannot be changed. |
| **Create Life** | Only the gods create true life. |
| **Affect the Gods** | Divine beings are beyond mortal magic. |
| **Free Power** | Magic always costs something. |
| **Destroy Souls** | Souls can be trapped but not unmade. |
| **Heal Everything** | Some wounds, curses, and conditions resist. |

### Protective Factors

Certain things disrupt or resist magic:

- **Cold Iron:** Meteoric iron or iron forged without fire disrupts magical effects
- **Sacred Ground:** Consecrated spaces resist hostile magic
- **True Faith:** Genuine belief provides protection against curses, possession, and mind control

### Risks

| Risk | Cause | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Exhaustion** | Any casting | Physical collapse |
| **Madness** | Prolonged or powerful use | [[The Mad King]]'s fate |
| **Nightmares** | Regular practice | Visions of things that notice you |
| **Attention** | Forbidden magic | Demons notice; [[The Faith of the Three]] investigates |
| **Spiritual Debt** | Pacts, spirit magic | Something comes to collect |
| **Mutation** | Forbidden magic | Physical changes |
| **Personality Shift** | Prolonged forbidden use | You become what you practice |

2. **Journeyman:** Competent with one school, can work independently
3. **Master:** Expert in one school, competent in others, takes apprentices
4. **Archmage:** Legendary power, perhaps a dozen living in Eldermyr

**Divine Tradition:**
1. **Initiate:** Learning prayers, minor blessings
2. **Priest:** Can channel healing, perform rites
3. **Confessor:** Significant divine power, leads congregations
4. **High Confessor:** Leader of [[The Faith of the Three]], speaks for [[The Faith of the Three]]

## Social Impact

### Public Perception

Common folk treat magic users with wary respect. A healer is welcomed. A diviner is consulted. A wizard is watched. After [[The Mad King|the Mad King]], everyone remembers what happens when magic goes wrong.

[[The Faith of the Three]] teaches that divine magic is blessed, bloodline magic is tolerated (a gift from [[The Faith of the Three]] to ancient heroes), and academic magic is acceptable if properly regulated. Everything else ranges from suspicious to heretical.

### Legal Framework

**Regulated:** Academic magic requires no formal license, but practitioners who cause harm face severe punishment. Nobles are expected to register bloodline mages in their households.

**Restricted:** Mind-affecting magic (enchantment, memory manipulation) is legal only for Faith inquisitors during sanctioned investigations.

**Forbidden:** Necromancy, demon summoning, blood sacrifice, and soul magic are capital crimes. [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] maintains inquisitors specifically to hunt such practitioners.

### Military Applications

Battle mages are rare and valuable. A pyromancer or electromancer can break an enemy formation. A skilled healer keeps soldiers fighting. Diviners provide intelligence.

During [[The Great War]], both sides employed mages—but [[The Mad King]]'s forces used darker arts. The Battle of [[The Ashen Fields]] saw rituals that have left the land cursed to this day.

### Economic Role

Magic is expensive. Potions cost more than a laborer earns in a month. Enchanted items are treasures passed down through generations. Only the wealthy can afford magical services regularly.

This makes mages valuable to nobles and merchants—and creates tension between the Art and common folk who can never access its benefits.

## History

### Origin

Magic has existed since the dawn of Eldermyr. [[The Faith of the Three|The Three]] granted power to the first priests. The ancient bloodlines were blessed (or cursed) by beings long forgotten. Academic magic was systematized by scholars of the Old Empire, centuries ago.

### [[The Mad King]]'s Legacy

Twenty-three years ago, [[High King Aldric II|King Aldric]] I—convinced something terrible was coming—turned to forbidden magic. His rituals required blood sacrifice. His court mages became demon-binders. His soldiers carried cursed weapons.

He was right that something was coming. His methods made it worse.

When he fell at the [[The Ashen Fields]], the magic he'd unleashed didn't die with him. The land was scarred. The dead were restless. His younger son, [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]], ordered the battlefield sealed with the most powerful wards the realm's mages could create.

Those wards held for twenty years. They're failing now.

### Current Era

Magic in Eldermyr exists under a shadow. [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] watches practitioners more closely than before. Common folk trust mages less. The old academies have shrunk; fewer masters take apprentices.

And yet magic is needed more than ever. The dead are rising. Something walks in the [[The Ashen Fields]]. [[Lord Draven Karath]] has reached out to powers he shouldn't have.

The realm's mages must decide which side they serve—or whether to flee before the storm breaks.

## Secrets

1. The [[Mad King]]'s power came from something trapped beneath the [[The Ashen Fields]]—something older than [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]. His rituals weren't summoning; they were answering.

2. The wards sealing the [[The Ashen Fields]] didn't just hold the dead down. They held something IN. The dead are rising because something is breaking out.

3. [[High Confessor Maren]]'s visions don't come from [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]. He hasn't realized this yet.

4. Some bloodline magic doesn't descend from ancient heroes blessed by the gods. Some descends from things that wore human faces for a time.

## Plot Hooks

1. A village healer is accused of necromancy—her patients recover too well, and the local priest is suspicious. Is she innocent, or has she found a new source of power?

2. A dying wizard seeks an apprentice to inherit his tower—but his library contains texts that would earn a death sentence if [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] discovered them.

3. The [[The Ashen Fields]] wards need reinforcement. The realm's masters must gather to repair them—but someone doesn't want the wards restored.

4. A noble sorcerer's magic is changing, growing stronger and stranger. Her bloodline carries something she doesn't understand—and it's waking up.

### Warding Magic (Academic Tradition)
**Prompt:**
A weathered wizard in dark robes casting warding magic over the ancient battlefield ruins of the Ashen Fields at twilight, one of the realm's masters maintaining the seals that hold back the rising dead. The mage is human, male, in his sixties with a silver beard and eyes that have seen too much, his face showing intense concentration and the exhaustion of power spent. Pale blue runic symbols spiral upward from his outstretched hands, forming geometric patterns of protection in the air—interlocking circles and triangles that glow with cold light against the gray sky. The runes are Old Tongue script, words of binding and containment taught from master to apprentice for generations. Behind him, other mages work at the boundary of the cursed ground, their own magic adding to the great working. In the background, shadowy figures stir among old grave markers—the dead testing the wards, pressing against the invisible barrier. Cold mist rises from the blighted ground. The wizard's robes are travel-worn, his staff inscribed with personal wards, and dark circles under his eyes speak to nights without sleep. The atmosphere of desperate holding action, of power used not for glory but for grim necessity.

### The Cost of Power (Forbidden Magic)
**Prompt:**
A practitioner of forbidden magic paying the price for the power they've claimed, alone in a hidden chamber beneath a noble's tower. The figure—gender ambiguous, face hidden in shadows—kneels in a circle of blood and chalk, their arms bare to show the spreading corruption: dark veins climbing toward the heart, skin taking on a gray pallor, fingernails blackening at the edges. Before them, dark flames burn in a brazier without consuming the herbs that fuel them—flames that cast shadows pointing toward the caster rather than away. The air around the figure shimmers with power they shouldn't possess, necromantic energy visible as wisps of purple-black mist. Their reflection in a nearby mirror shows something different than the figure itself: older, more decayed, eyes completely black. On a table rest the components of forbidden magic: a skull inscribed with demon names, a blade still wet with sacrifice, pages from a grimoire that will be burned if the Faith's inquisitors ever find it. The chamber walls bear protective symbols—not to keep things out, but to keep what's inside from being detected. The atmosphere of terrible bargain, of power gained at the cost of humanity slowly being paid.

### The Grimoire and Study
**Prompt:**
An ancient iron-bound grimoire resting open on a stone altar in the study of an academic mage, the accumulated knowledge of generations of practitioners. The tome is massive—two feet across when open—its pages yellowed with age but preserved by careful magic, covered in arcane script that glows faintly gold in the candlelight. Illuminated diagrams show the geometric patterns of protective wards, the anatomical maps used in healing magic, and the stellar charts required for divination. Around the grimoire, the tools of the academic tradition: dried herbs sorted into labeled ceramic jars, a silver ritual knife whose blade has never cut flesh, glass vials of alchemical preparations ranging from healing draughts to deadly poisons, a crystal sphere for scrying, candles of beeswax inscribed with focusing runes. The altar itself is ancient stone, its surface carved with runic wards against magical accident and theft. The study beyond is visible in soft focus: shelves of additional tomes, specimen jars containing preserved creatures, a skeleton used for anatomical reference, astronomical instruments. Dust motes float in the beam of light from a high window. The atmosphere of accumulated knowledge and careful practice, of magic as discipline rather than gift. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, warm candlelight atmosphere, rich textures on aged parchment and magical implements, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy wizard's study illustration.

### Divine Magic (Faith Tradition)
**Prompt:**
A priest of the Faith of the Three channeling divine healing magic over a wounded soldier in a battlefield infirmary, the most honored form of magic in Eldermyr. The priest is a middle-aged woman in the white and gold robes of a Confessor, her face serene with faith despite the chaos around her. Golden light streams from her raised hands into the soldier's chest wound—not cold like academic magic but warm, alive, carrying the blessing of the Three. The soldier's wound visibly closes, flesh knitting together, blood ceasing to flow. Around the holy symbol at the priest's throat, a halo of divine power glows. Other wounded lie on pallets around her, waiting their turn, hope in their pain-glazed eyes. Attending acolytes in simpler robes assist, holding the soldier still, preparing bandages for those the magic cannot fully heal. The infirmary tent's canvas walls are marked with the triple symbol of the Faith—the Warden's shield, the Chronicler's book, and the Mother's open hand. Candles burn at a small altar despite the daylight, offerings to the divine. The atmosphere of mercy amid horror, of faith made manifest in healing power.
