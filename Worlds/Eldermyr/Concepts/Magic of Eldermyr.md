# Magic of Eldermyr

> *"Magic is not a gift. It is a debt you pay with your own flesh, your own years, your own sanity. Those who think otherwise have never cast a spell that mattered."*
> — Attributed to Archmage Valdros the Grey

## Overview

Magic in Eldermyr is rare, powerful, and dangerous. Perhaps one person in a thousand carries the spark—and of those, most never develop it beyond hedge-tricks and minor cantrips. True practitioners are remarkable figures: valued by lords, watched by the [[The Faith of the Three|Faith]], and viewed with a mix of awe and fear by common folk.

Magic draws from multiple sources—divine grace, inherited blood, rigorous study, communion with spirits, or darker bargains—but all magic shares one truth: it costs. Power is not free. The Art demands payment in exhaustion, components, years of life, or pieces of the soul. Those who forget this lesson do not practice magic for long.

Since the Mad King's fall twenty-three years ago, the realm views magic with renewed suspicion. His dark rituals broke something that was better left whole. Now the dead stir in the [[Ashen Fields]], and the [[The Faith of the Three|Faith]] hunts forbidden practitioners with renewed zeal.

## Classification

### Types of Magic

Magic in Eldermyr falls into five broad traditions, each with its own source, methods, and social standing:

| Tradition | Source | Status | Practitioners |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Divine** | Granted by [[The Faith of the Three\|the Three]] | Respected | Priests, Confessors |
| **Bloodline** | Inherited magical ancestry | Tolerated | Noble Sorcerers |
| **Academic** | Rigorous study and discipline | Distrusted | Wizards, Scholars |
| **Spirit** | Communion with the dead | Suspicious | Wise Women, Mediums |
| **Forbidden** | Demonic pacts, necromancy | Hunted | Warlocks, Necromancers |

### Underlying Mechanics

All magic, regardless of tradition, operates on certain shared principles:

**Life Force:** Magic draws from the caster's vitality. Minor spells tire; major workings can leave a mage bedridden for days or take years from their life. This is why most practitioners live shorter lives than common folk, despite their power.

**Runic Foundation:** Complex magic requires symbols, inscriptions, and wards. The [[Ashen Fields]] were bound by runic seals for twenty years. Those seals are failing now.

**Component Cost:** Most magic requires material components—herbs, minerals, preserved organs, rare metals. This keeps the Art expensive and limits who can practice it seriously.

## Mechanics

### Fundamental Principles

Magic reshapes reality through will, knowledge, and sacrifice. The caster imposes their desire on the world, paying for the change with their own life force and whatever components the working requires. The greater the effect, the greater the cost. There are no shortcuts—only debts deferred or paid by others.

### Accessing Magic by Tradition

**Divine Magic:**
- Accessed through prayer, ritual, and devotion to [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]
- Requires ordination and genuine faith
- Power flows from the gods through the practitioner
- Limited by doctrine—the Three do not grant power for forbidden works

**Bloodline Magic:**
- Manifests instinctively, often in childhood
- Cannot be taught to those without the blood
- Inherited memory sometimes provides ancestral knowledge through dreams
- Different bloodlines carry different affinities

**Academic Magic:**
- Learned through years of study with a master or from rare texts
- Requires natural aptitude plus discipline
- Most structured and understood form of magic
- Knowledge is hoarded and rarely shared freely

**Spirit Magic:**
- Accessed through communion with ancestral spirits or the dead
- Taught through dream instruction and oral traditions
- Walks a gray line between honored tradition and forbidden necromancy
- Growing more powerful—and more dangerous—as the [[Ashen Fields]] stir

**Forbidden Magic:**
- Accessed through pacts with demonic entities
- Or through necromantic rituals that violate the dead
- Power is quick and potent—but the costs are hidden at first
- Always corrupts the practitioner

### Casting Methods

**Verbal Components:** Most magic requires spoken words—invocations, prayers, true names, or words of power. Silent casting is possible for masters but extremely difficult.

**Somatic Components:** Gestures, hand signs, and ritual movements focus magical energy. Bound or restrained mages have difficulty casting.

**Material Components:** Herbs, minerals, blood, rare substances. Academic magic is particularly dependent on components. Divine magic often substitutes holy symbols.

**Focus Items:** Staves, wands, orbs, holy symbols. Not strictly required, but they reduce strain and improve control.

**Ritual Requirements:** Major workings require hours or days of preparation, specific locations, astronomical timing, or multiple participants.

### Schools of Magic

**Sanctioned Schools:**
| School | Effects | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Healing** | Mending wounds, curing disease, removing poison | Honored, taught by Faith |
| **Divination** | Seeing truth, past, future, hidden things | Valued, carefully watched |
| **Alchemy** | Potions, salves, material transmutation | Respectable trade |
| **Warding** | Protection, barriers, seals, abjuration | High demand |
| **Artifice** | Creating enchanted items | Rare, prestigious |

**Distrusted Schools:**
| School | Effects | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Illusion** | False sensory experiences | "Liars with power" |
| **Enchantment** | Affecting emotions and thoughts | Borders on forbidden |
| **Transmutation** | Changing one thing to another | Unsettling |
| **Pyromancy** | Fire magic | Valuable in war, dangerous in peace |
| **Geomancy** | Earth and stone magic | Old ways, tolerated |

**Rare Schools:**
| School | Effects | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Druidism** | Nature communion | Rural, distrusted by Faith |
| **Electromancy** | Storm and lightning | Rare, dramatic |
| **Telepathy** | Mental communication | Very rare bloodline gift |

**Forbidden Schools:**
| School | Effects | Punishment |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Necromancy** | Animating or contacting dead | Death by burning |
| **Summoning** | Calling entities from beyond | Death by burning |
| **Binding** | Trapping spirits | Death by burning |
| **Biomancy** | Shaping flesh | Imprisonment or death |

### Power Levels

**Cantrips/Minor Effects:**
- Light, minor healing, small flames, simple divination
- Tiring but not dangerous
- Most practitioners never exceed this level

**Moderate Effects:**
- Serious healing, battle magic, useful enchantments
- Requires significant rest afterward
- The level of a competent professional

**Major Effects:**
- Raising wards over buildings, powerful combat magic, complex rituals
- Days of recovery; possible permanent cost
- Master-level work

**Legendary Effects:**
- Sealing an entire battlefield (the [[Ashen Fields]] wards)
- Moving through space instantly
- Binding or banishing powerful entities
- Years of life or death of the caster
- Perhaps a handful of living practitioners could attempt such things

## Costs & Limitations

### Energy Cost

All magic exacts a price:
- **Minor Casting:** Tiredness equivalent to hard labor
- **Moderate Casting:** Exhaustion requiring hours of rest
- **Major Casting:** Days bedridden; possible lasting fatigue
- **Legendary Casting:** Years of life; permanent damage; death

### Absolute Limitations

What magic CANNOT do in Eldermyr:

| Limitation | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **True Resurrection** | Death is final. Undead are not alive. |
| **Immortality** | All things die. Life can be extended, but not forever. |
| **Time Travel** | The past cannot be changed. |
| **Create Life** | Only the gods create true life. |
| **Affect the Gods** | Divine beings are beyond mortal magic. |
| **Free Power** | Magic always costs something. |
| **Destroy Souls** | Souls can be trapped but not unmade. |
| **Heal Everything** | Some wounds, curses, and conditions resist. |

### Protective Factors

Certain things disrupt or resist magic:

- **Cold Iron:** Meteoric iron or iron forged without fire disrupts magical effects
- **Sacred Ground:** Consecrated spaces resist hostile magic
- **True Faith:** Genuine belief provides protection against curses, possession, and mind control

### Risks

| Risk | Cause | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Exhaustion** | Any casting | Physical collapse |
| **Madness** | Prolonged or powerful use | The Mad King's fate |
| **Nightmares** | Regular practice | Visions of things that notice you |
| **Attention** | Forbidden magic | Demons notice; the Faith investigates |
| **Spiritual Debt** | Pacts, spirit magic | Something comes to collect |
| **Mutation** | Forbidden magic | Physical changes |
| **Personality Shift** | Prolonged forbidden use | You become what you practice |

2. **Journeyman:** Competent with one school, can work independently
3. **Master:** Expert in one school, competent in others, takes apprentices
4. **Archmage:** Legendary power, perhaps a dozen living in Eldermyr

**Divine Tradition:**
1. **Initiate:** Learning prayers, minor blessings
2. **Priest:** Can channel healing, perform rites
3. **Confessor:** Significant divine power, leads congregations
4. **High Confessor:** Leader of the Faith, speaks for the Three

## Social Impact

### Public Perception

Common folk treat magic users with wary respect. A healer is welcomed. A diviner is consulted. A wizard is watched. After the Mad King, everyone remembers what happens when magic goes wrong.

The Faith teaches that divine magic is blessed, bloodline magic is tolerated (a gift from the Three to ancient heroes), and academic magic is acceptable if properly regulated. Everything else ranges from suspicious to heretical.

### Legal Framework

**Regulated:** Academic magic requires no formal license, but practitioners who cause harm face severe punishment. Nobles are expected to register bloodline mages in their households.

**Restricted:** Mind-affecting magic (enchantment, memory manipulation) is legal only for Faith inquisitors during sanctioned investigations.

**Forbidden:** Necromancy, demon summoning, blood sacrifice, and soul magic are capital crimes. The Faith maintains inquisitors specifically to hunt such practitioners.

### Military Applications

Battle mages are rare and valuable. A pyromancer or electromancer can break an enemy formation. A skilled healer keeps soldiers fighting. Diviners provide intelligence.

During the Great War, both sides employed mages—but the Mad King's forces used darker arts. The Battle of [[Ashen Fields]] saw rituals that have left the land cursed to this day.

### Economic Role

Magic is expensive. Potions cost more than a laborer earns in a month. Enchanted items are treasures passed down through generations. Only the wealthy can afford magical services regularly.

This makes mages valuable to nobles and merchants—and creates tension between the Art and common folk who can never access its benefits.

## History

### Origin

Magic has existed since the dawn of Eldermyr. The Three granted power to the first priests. The ancient bloodlines were blessed (or cursed) by beings long forgotten. Academic magic was systematized by scholars of the Old Empire, centuries ago.

### The Mad King's Legacy

Twenty-three years ago, King Aldric I—convinced something terrible was coming—turned to forbidden magic. His rituals required blood sacrifice. His court mages became demon-binders. His soldiers carried cursed weapons.

He was right that something was coming. His methods made it worse.

When he fell at the [[Ashen Fields]], the magic he'd unleashed didn't die with him. The land was scarred. The dead were restless. His younger son, [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]], ordered the battlefield sealed with the most powerful wards the realm's mages could create.

Those wards held for twenty years. They're failing now.

### Current Era

Magic in Eldermyr exists under a shadow. The Faith watches practitioners more closely than before. Common folk trust mages less. The old academies have shrunk; fewer masters take apprentices.

And yet magic is needed more than ever. The dead are rising. Something walks in the [[Ashen Fields]]. [[Lord Draven Karath]] has reached out to powers he shouldn't have.

The realm's mages must decide which side they serve—or whether to flee before the storm breaks.

## Secrets

1. The [[Mad King]]'s power came from something trapped beneath the [[Ashen Fields]]—something older than the Three. His rituals weren't summoning; they were answering.

2. The wards sealing the [[Ashen Fields]] didn't just hold the dead down. They held something IN. The dead are rising because something is breaking out.

3. [[High Confessor Maren]]'s visions don't come from the Three. He hasn't realized this yet.

4. Some bloodline magic doesn't descend from ancient heroes blessed by the gods. Some descends from things that wore human faces for a time.

## Plot Hooks

1. A village healer is accused of necromancy—her patients recover too well, and the local priest is suspicious. Is she innocent, or has she found a new source of power?

2. A dying wizard seeks an apprentice to inherit his tower—but his library contains texts that would earn a death sentence if the Faith discovered them.

3. The [[Ashen Fields]] wards need reinforcement. The realm's masters must gather to repair them—but someone doesn't want the wards restored.

4. A noble sorcerer's magic is changing, growing stronger and stranger. Her bloodline carries something she doesn't understand—and it's waking up.
