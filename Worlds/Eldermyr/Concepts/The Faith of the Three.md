# The Faith of the Three

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> This pantheon represents the dominant religion of Eldermyr—three equal gods who established the divine covenant with mortals. The Faith shapes law, morality, and politics across the realm, but internal divisions and the current crisis threaten its unity.

## Overview
The Faith of the Three is the dominant religion of Eldermyr, teaching that three equal gods—the Warden, the Shepherd, and the Chronicler—created the world and established a sacred covenant with mortalkind. Unlike hierarchical pantheons, the Three are unified in purpose yet distinct in domain, representing the pillars of civilized existence: order, compassion, and memory. The Faith's church wields enormous political influence, its clergy serve as judges and healers, and its doctrine shapes everything from inheritance law to funeral rites. Yet beneath the unified doctrine, regional variations persist, heretical sects multiply, and the rising dead crisis has shaken believers to their core.

## Classification

### Type
**Pantheon Type:** Triumvirate (Three Equal Deities)

**Divine Origin:** Primordial (present at creation; their origins are not explained in scripture)

### Structure
**Hierarchy:** Balanced (no chief deity; the Three are co-equal)

**Number of Deities:** Few (exactly 3 major deities, plus saints)

### Scope
**Associated Cultures:** All of Eldermyr, with regional variations
**Geographic Spread:** Continental (dominant throughout Eldermyr; unknown beyond)

## Divine Hierarchy

### Chief Deity
**Name:** None—the Three are equal
**Title:** The Triune, The Three Who Are One
**Domain:** All creation, divided into three aspects
**Role in Pantheon:** Orthodox doctrine holds that the Three act in perfect unity

### Major Deities
| Deity | Domain | Symbol | Role |
|-------|--------|--------|------|
| [[The Warden]] | Order, Justice, Rightful Rule | Crown above crossed scales and sword | Patron of rulers, judges, oaths |
| [[The Shepherd]] | Mercy, Healing, the Common Good | Open hands beneath a hooded figure | Patron of healers, farmers, families |
| [[The Chronicler]] | Memory, Death, the Final Rest | Veiled figure holding a great book | Keeper of the dead, patron of scholars |

### Minor Deities
The Faith does not acknowledge minor deities—only the Three.

| Category | Names | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Saints | [[Saint Aldwyn the Merciful]], [[Saint Kira of the Blade]], [[Saint Erasmus the Rememberer]] | Blessed mortals who serve as intercessors |
| Blessed Dead | Ancestors in the Chronicler's Halls | May be honored but not worshipped |

### Demigods/Divine Servants
- The Faith does not teach of divine servants or angels in the traditional sense
- Some texts reference "the Veiled Ones"—servants of the Chronicler who guide souls—but whether they are independent beings or aspects of the Chronicler is disputed
- Saints after death serve as intercessors but are not divine themselves

### Fallen/Exiled Gods
- Orthodox doctrine acknowledges no fallen gods
- Heretical texts speak of a "Fourth" who was cast out—the god of chaos, freedom, or destruction—but the Synod condemns these as fabrications
- **Secret:** The thing beneath [[the Ashen Fields]] may be something that predates even the Three

## Relationships

### Divine Family Tree
The Three are not related by blood or origin. They simply *are*—co-eternal, co-equal, unified in purpose. Scripture describes them as "three flames of one fire" or "three voices of one song."

### Alliances
- The Three work in perfect harmony (doctrinally)
- The Warden establishes order; the Shepherd tends the people within that order; the Chronicler remembers all that passes
- This creates a complete cycle: law, life, and legacy

### Rivalries
- Orthodox: None. The Three cannot conflict.
- **Heretical (The Triarchy):** Claims the Three are actually at war—the Warden seeks control, the Shepherd enables weakness, the Chronicler hoards secrets. Mortals must choose sides.

### Romantic Entanglements
- The Three have no romantic relationships in any scripture
- They are beyond mortal concepts of gender or desire
- Regional folk traditions sometimes depict the Shepherd as nurturing/feminine and the Warden as stern/masculine, but the Synod considers these merely metaphorical

### Divine Courts/Factions
1. **The Unified Synod:** Orthodox position—the Three act as one through their mortal church
2. **The Warden's Hand:** Eastern emphasis on law, justice, martial virtue
3. **The Shepherd's Path:** Western emphasis on mercy, healing, community
4. **The Chronicler's Silence:** Northern emphasis on death rites, ancestor honor, memory

## Mythology

### Creation Myth
In the beginning, there was only the Void—formless, timeless, empty. Then the Three emerged (from where, scripture does not say) and spoke the First Words. The Warden spoke Order, giving form to chaos. The Shepherd spoke Life, filling form with breath. The Chronicler spoke Memory, ensuring that what was made would endure beyond the moment. Thus the world came to be, and the covenant was established: mortals would live according to the Three's design, and in return, their souls would find eternal rest.

### The Divine Realm
Where do these gods dwell?
- **Name:** The Eternal Halls (collectively); each god has their own aspect
- **Nature:** Beyond mortal comprehension; described in scripture as "light that does not blind, warmth that does not burn, peace that does not end"
- **Mortal Access:** Souls pass there after death; the living cannot enter except in visions granted to saints

### Major Myths
1. **The First Words:** The creation of the world from chaos through divine speech
2. **The Covenant of Rest:** When the first mortals died, the Chronicler established that all souls would find peace, not dissolution—in exchange for mortal adherence to divine law
3. **The Silence of the Fourth:** Heretical texts speak of a fourth voice that spoke Discord—and was unmade by the Three. Orthodox teaching denies this myth.
4. **Saint Kira's Vigil:** When darkness threatened to overwhelm the realm, Saint Kira stood alone for seven days and nights, and the Warden himself granted her strength to prevail

### Prophecies
Divine prophecies affecting the pantheon:
- **The Reckoning of Kings:** "When brother's blood stains the throne, the covenant shall be tested." Many believe this refers to the current succession crisis.
- **The Unwritten Chapter:** The Chronicler's book has empty pages at the end—scripture hints these will be filled only when the world ends, or transforms.

### The Afterlife
The soul's journey after death:
1. **The Final Walk:** The soul travels to the Chronicler's Halls
2. **The Recording:** Every deed is inscribed in the Great Book; the soul witnesses their complete life
3. **The Reckoning:** Not judgment, but clarity—the soul understands the weight of their choices
4. **The Rest:** The soul enters the Halls, reunited with loved ones, at peace forever

**The Echo:** A resonance of the soul may linger in the mortal world, fading over generations. This explains ancestor spirits without contradicting the soul's passage.

**The Silence:** Souls who cannot bear their Recording may turn away and choose dissolution—ceasing to exist rather than facing themselves. Whether this is mercy or damnation is disputed.

## Worship

### Unified Worship
The Three are worshipped collectively in all major ceremonies:
- **Circumstances:** Holy days, rites of passage, state occasions
- **Locations:** Cathedrals dedicated to all Three; the great cathedral at [[Thornhall]]
- **Occasions:** Coronations, weddings, funerals, harvest festivals

### Individual Worship
- Common folk pray to whichever god suits their need: the Warden for justice, the Shepherd for healing, the Chronicler for remembrance
- Soldiers favor the Warden; farmers the Shepherd; scholars the Chronicler
- Most people maintain general devotion to all Three

### Priests
- All clergy are ordained to serve all Three
- In practice, priests often specialize: Warden-priests serve as judges and military chaplains; Shepherd-priests as healers and community leaders; Chronicler-priests as funeral officiants and archivists
- The Synod insists this is practical division, not theological separation

### Temples
**Pantheon Temples:** The standard. Cathedrals and chapels contain three altars—or a single three-sided altar—representing the unified Three.

**Single-Deity Temples:** Officially discouraged but exist in practice. Military fortresses often have Warden-only shrines; hospitals feature Shepherd-focused chapels; great libraries honor the Chronicler.

### Holy Days
| Festival | Deity/Deities | Celebration |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| First Words (Spring Equinox) | All Three | Creation celebration; new beginnings; planting |
| Midsummer's Crown | The Warden | Justice courts convene; oaths renewed; tournaments |
| Harvest Home | The Shepherd | Thanks for abundance; charity to the poor |
| Remembrance Night (Autumn Equinox) | The Chronicler | Honor the dead; read the names of the departed |
| Midwinter's Rest | The Chronicler | Longest night; contemplation of mortality; candle vigils |

## Divine Interaction

### With Mortals
How the Three interact with the mortal world:
- **Frequency:** Rarely, if ever, directly. The gods withdrew after the covenant was established.
- **Methods:** Scripture, sacraments, signs and omens, answered prayers, the effectiveness of holy rites against evil
- **Restrictions:** Orthodox doctrine holds that direct visions are extraordinary and should be treated with skepticism

### Divine Champions
- Saints were chosen during their lives through exceptional virtue, not explicit divine selection
- The Faith does not teach of active divine champions in the present age
- High Confessor [[Maren]] claims visionary guidance, which is... doctrinally complicated

### Divine Magic
Clerics receive power through:
- Ordination (sacramental blessing by existing clergy)
- Devotion (genuine faith and adherence to doctrine)
- The divine magic itself is proof the Three answer—but whether this is active blessing or residual covenant power is debated

### Miracles
Divine interventions are:
- Healings that defy natural explanation
- Holy ground repelling the undead and demonic
- Consecrated items harming unnatural creatures
- Unlikely deliverances attributed to divine providence

## Cosmological Role

### Cosmic Function
The Three maintain the fundamental order of existence:
- The Warden preserves cosmic law
- The Shepherd ensures life continues
- The Chronicler maintains continuity through memory

Without them, doctrine teaches, reality would dissolve back into primordial chaos.

### Relationship to Other Pantheons
The Faith's position on foreign gods:
- **Official:** Other peoples worship aspects of the Three under different names, or they worship false gods / demons / nothing
- **Practical:** The church is not evangelical; foreigners can believe what they wish as long as Eldermyr follows the true Faith
- Some scholars quietly wonder if foreign gods might be real—and what that means

### Enemies
**Divine Enemies:**
- [[The Bound]] — Demons and corrupted spirits who oppose the covenant
- Whatever the Mad King bargained with
- **The Unnamed** — The thing beneath the Ashen Fields (unknown to doctrine)

**Cosmic Threats:**
- The return of primordial chaos
- The breaking of the covenant
- The dead failing to find rest (currently happening)

## History

### Origin
The Three are eternal and have always existed—this is doctrine. They emerged from (or before) the primordial void and created the world through the First Words. Their origin is not explained because, from the Faith's perspective, they have no origin; they simply *are*.

### Major Events
1. **The First Words:** Creation of the world
2. **The Covenant of Rest:** Establishment of the afterlife and divine law
3. **The Silence of the Fourth (heretical):** Alleged casting out of a chaos god
4. **The Age of Saints:** Period when saints performed great miracles (500+ years ago)
5. **The Thornhall Schism (disputed):** When the Chronicler's Silence tradition nearly split from the Orthodox Synod; reconciled but tensions remain

### Changes Over Time
- The Faith has grown more institutionalized and politically powerful over centuries
- Direct divine interaction has become rarer (or less acknowledged)
- Regional variations have become more pronounced
- The current crisis is the greatest challenge in living memory

### Current Era
The Faith faces its greatest test. The rising dead violate the most fundamental promise—that the Chronicler ensures all souls find rest. High Confessor Maren's claims of divine vision challenge orthodox doctrine. The succession crisis forces the church to take political sides. Some whisper that the covenant itself is breaking, and the clergy have no answers.

## Mortal Impact

### Cultural Influence
The Faith shapes every aspect of Eldermyr society:
- **Laws and Morality:** Murder violates the Shepherd's domain; theft violates the Warden's order; disrespecting the dead violates the Chronicler's memory. Laws derive from divine mandate.
- **Social Structure:** The clergy form a distinct class; noble houses claim divine favor; oaths sworn before the Three are unbreakable.
- **Art and Architecture:** Three-fold symmetry dominates religious art; cathedrals use triple-arched doorways; the triangle is a holy symbol.

### Political Role
- The Synod advises rulers on matters of doctrine and morality
- Clergy serve as judges, witnesses, and neutral parties in disputes
- Coronations require religious blessing—a king without the Faith's approval faces legitimacy questions
- High Confessor [[Maren]] is actively intervening in the succession crisis, claiming divine mandate

### Daily Life
- Morning prayers to the Three (brief, often rote)
- Meals blessed before eating
- Weddings, births, and deaths all require religious rites
- Swearing oaths invokes the Three as witnesses
- Common folk make small offerings at household shrines
- Festivals mark the sacred calendar

## The Deities

### The Warden
**Domain:** Order, Justice, Rightful Rule, Oaths, Law, Sovereignty
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
**Symbol:** A crown above crossed scales and sword
**Description:** The Warden is depicted as a stern, crowned figure—sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes ambiguous—holding the scales of justice in one hand and a blade in the other. The Warden represents the divine order that separates civilization from chaos. Rulers claim authority through the Warden's mandate; oaths sworn in the Warden's name cannot be broken without spiritual consequence. The Warden does not forgive, but neither does the Warden condemn unfairly. Justice is absolute.

### The Shepherd
**Domain:** Mercy, Healing, Community, Harvest, Family, Protection, the Common Good
**Alignment:** Neutral Good
**Symbol:** Open hands extended from beneath a hooded cloak
**Description:** The Shepherd appears as a gentle, hooded figure whose face is never clearly visible—only the warmth of the extended hands. The Shepherd represents divine compassion, the care of the Three for their mortal children. Healers call upon the Shepherd; farmers thank the Shepherd for rain; parents pray to the Shepherd for their children's safety. Where the Warden represents what mortals *owe*, the Shepherd represents what they *receive*.

### The Chronicler
**Domain:** Memory, Death, Knowledge, the Final Rest, Ancestors, History, Truth
**Alignment:** True Neutral
**Symbol:** A veiled figure holding an immense open book
**Description:** The Chronicler is shrouded and veiled, identity obscured, hands holding the Great Book in which all things are recorded. The Chronicler does not judge—only remembers. Every deed, every thought, every secret is inscribed. When mortals die, the Chronicler receives them, records their lives, and grants them rest. Scholars honor the Chronicler's domain of knowledge; the grieving take comfort in the Chronicler's promise that the dead are not forgotten. The current crisis—dead rising, souls denied rest—is a direct violation of the Chronicler's covenant, and the faithful are terrified.

## Secrets

1. **The Three are real, but not alone.** Something older sleeps beneath [[the Ashen Fields]]—something that predates the covenant, perhaps predates the Three themselves. The Mad King found it. It is waking.

2. **High Confessor Maren's visions don't come from the Three.** She believes they do. She is wrong. Whatever speaks to her wears the voice of gods, but it is not divine.

3. **The "Fourth" may be real.** Heretical texts speak of a god of chaos who was unmade. But things unmade sometimes wish to be remade. Some scholars believe the thing beneath the Ashen Fields is the Fourth, imprisoned rather than destroyed.

4. **The saints' miracles have been declining for centuries.** The clergy hides this, but divine magic grows weaker with each generation. Something is wrong with the covenant—and it began long before the Mad King.

5. **The Chronicler's Book has begun writing itself.** In the great monastery at [[Thornhall]], the sacred replica of the Great Book—blank for centuries—has started filling with words no mortal wrote. The monks who read them have not spoken since.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Empty Pulpit:** A beloved village priest has vanished. Investigation reveals he discovered something in ancient texts—something about the Fourth—and fled rather than face what he learned.

2. **The Unblessed King:** One claimant to the throne has been refused religious blessing by the Synod. They approach the party to investigate why—and whether there's truth to rumors of demonic taint in their bloodline.

3. **The Silent Monastery:** The Chronicler's monks at an isolated monastery have all stopped speaking. They still work, still pray, still write—but they will not utter a word. What did they witness?

4. **The Ash Penitents:** A growing cult believes the rising dead are divine punishment and practices extreme mortification. Are they dangerous fanatics—or do they know something the Synod doesn't?

5. **The Heretic's Evidence:** A condemned Triarchy heretic claims proof that the Three are at war with each other—and that choosing the wrong side in the succession crisis means damnation.
