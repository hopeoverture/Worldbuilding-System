# The Old Ways

## Overview

The Old Ways are the ancient spiritual traditions that predated [[The Faith of the Three]] across Eldermyr. While [[The Faith of the Three]] has become the dominant religion in most of the realm, the Old Ways persist in the remote regions—particularly [[The Northlands]], where [[The Spirit-Speakers]] continue the ancient practices of ancestor veneration, nature worship, and communion with the spirits of the land.

Unlike [[The Faith of the Three]]'s organized priesthood and written doctrine, the Old Ways are passed down through oral tradition, personal revelation, and apprenticeship. There is no single authority, no unified scripture, and no formal hierarchy—just the accumulated wisdom of countless generations who lived close to the land and learned to hear its voice.

## Core Beliefs

### The Living World
The Old Ways teach that the world itself is alive and aware. Mountains have spirits. Rivers carry memories. Trees whisper secrets to those who listen. This is not metaphor but literal truth—the land is sentient, and humanity exists as part of it, not separate from or above it.

### Ancestor Veneration
The dead do not truly leave. Ancestors remain as guides and guardians, speaking through dreams, omens, and the voices of [[The Spirit-Speakers]]. Honoring the dead is not merely respect—it's maintaining a relationship with powerful allies in the spirit world.

### The Cycle
All things move in cycles—seasons, lives, ages. Death is not an ending but a transformation. The Old Ways accept mortality as natural, even necessary, for the cycle to continue.

### Sacred Places
Certain locations hold particular power—stone circles, ancient groves, mountain peaks, sacred springs. These places are where the boundary between worlds grows thin, where communication with spirits becomes possible.

## Practices

### Spirit-Speaking
[[The Spirit-Speakers]] are the primary practitioners of the Old Ways, serving as intermediaries between the living and the spirit world. They interpret omens, channel ancestral wisdom, and maintain the sacred traditions.

### Seasonal Rituals
The Old Ways mark the turning of seasons with rituals—the winter solstice when the dead walk closest, the summer solstice when the land's power peaks, the equinoxes of balance.

### Sacred Groves
Communities maintain sacred groves where offerings are made and rituals performed. These groves are protected absolutely; cutting a sacred tree brings dire consequences.

### Burial Practices
The Old Ways dead are laid to rest in Spirit-Caves or burial mounds, oriented toward the mountains so their spirits can join the ancestors in [[The Greycrowns]].

## Relationship with The Faith of the Three

[[The Faith of the Three]] views the Old Ways as misguided at best, heretical at worst. Official doctrine holds that the Three are the only true divine powers, and that "spirits" are either delusions or demons in disguise.

In practice, the relationship varies by region:
- In [[The Crown Lands]]: The Old Ways are considered peasant superstition, tolerated but discouraged
- In [[The Northlands]]: Open practice continues alongside nominal Faith observance
- In [[The Eastern March]]: Suppressed; [[House Thorne]] enforces Faith orthodoxy
- In [[The Western Shore]]: Largely forgotten except among sailors

Many common folk quietly maintain Old Ways traditions alongside Faith worship—hedge their bets, as it were. Village priests often look the other way.

## Sacred Sites

- **The Standing Stones** — Ancient circle in [[The Northlands]], still used for solstice rituals
- **Stoneholm** — Sacred gathering place for [[The Spirit-Speakers]]
- **[[The Greycrowns]]** — The mountains themselves are sacred; spirits of ancestors dwell there
- **[[Myrkvid]]** — The ancient forest where nature spirits remain strong
- **[[The Greenward]]** — A corrupted druid grove that was once a sacred site

## Current Status

The Old Ways are experiencing a quiet resurgence. As [[The Ashen Fields]] spread their curse and the realm descends into political chaos, many are finding [[The Faith of the Three]]'s promises hollow. The spirits speak of dangers the Faith's priests cannot address. Ancestor wisdom warns of threats the Faith cannot counter.

In [[The Northlands]], [[The Spirit-Speakers]] report increased activity from the spirit world—the dead are restless, the land is afraid, and ancient powers are stirring. Whether this heralds renewal or catastrophe remains to be seen.
