# The Shepherd

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Shepherd is one of the Three equal gods of Eldermyr, representing divine compassion, healing, and community. Where the Warden represents what mortals owe, the Shepherd represents what they receive. The Shepherd's love is not earned—it simply is.

## Overview
The Shepherd embodies divine mercy, healing, and the bonds that hold communities together—the warmth that makes civilization worth preserving. Where the Warden demands and the Chronicler remembers, the Shepherd gives freely: comfort to the grieving, healing to the sick, protection to the vulnerable, hope to the despairing. The Shepherd's face is never clearly seen, for the Shepherd is known not by appearance but by action—the extended hands that offer help without asking whether it is deserved. Farmers pray to the Shepherd for rain; mothers pray for their children's safety; the dying pray for gentle passage. In the current crisis, the Shepherd's faithful struggle most—for how can they tend their flocks when war is coming and the dead refuse to rest?

## Divine Nature

### Appearance
The Shepherd manifests as a hooded figure whose face remains perpetually obscured—not by shadow, but by the natural inclination of observers to look at the extended hands instead. Those hands are always visible: weathered and strong, the hands of someone who works alongside their people rather than above them. The hood and cloak are simple homespun in warm brown or grey, patched and worn but clean. Warmth radiates from the Shepherd's presence like hearth-fire on a cold night—not the blinding radiance of divine glory, but the comfortable glow of being welcomed home. Some who have witnessed manifestations report seeing golden light where the face should be; others see the face of their own mother, or their village healer, or whoever first showed them kindness.

### Personality
The Shepherd loves without condition and gives without expectation. This is not weakness—the Shepherd's mercy is as absolute as the Warden's justice. Where the Warden sees what mortals have done, the Shepherd sees what they might become. The Shepherd grieves every death, celebrates every birth, and tends every wound with the same patient devotion. To the Shepherd, no one is beyond hope, though some choose to reject what is offered. The Shepherd does not force healing upon the unwilling, for even divine mercy respects mortal choice.

### Values
What does this deity value?
- Compassion shown to strangers and enemies
- Community bonds that sustain through hardship
- Healing given freely, not for profit
- The protection of those who cannot protect themselves
- Simple joys: good food, warm hearths, loving families

### Goals
What does this deity want?
- That all mortals live in peace, health, and community
- That mercy always has a voice, even when justice demands otherwise

### Flaws
What are the deity's weaknesses or blind spots?
- The Shepherd's mercy can enable those who do not deserve it—some take advantage of compassion
- The Shepherd's reluctance to confront evil directly means darkness can grow in the spaces between communities

**Enemies:** [[The Unnamed]] (corruption of life and death)
**Family:** The Three are not related but eternally co-equal

### With Other Pantheons

- The Faith does not officially acknowledge other pantheons
- Folk traditions sometimes blend the Shepherd with local harvest spirits or healing goddesses

### With Mortals
The Shepherd loves mortals as a parent loves children—fiercely, protectively, without condition. The Shepherd grieves when mortals suffer and rejoices when they flourish. Unlike the Warden's impartial regard, the Shepherd's love is personal, intimate, present in every act of kindness that passes between mortal souls.

### Divine Realm

**Description:** A warm and welcoming home that is somehow large enough for everyone; tables that are always set; fires that never go out; the smell of bread and the sound of laughter
**Location in Cosmology:** One aspect of the Eternal Halls, shared with the other Two

## Mythology

### Origin
The Shepherd emerged at creation as one of the Three who spoke the First Words. While the Warden spoke Order and the Chronicler spoke Memory, the Shepherd spoke Life—the breath that filled form with meaning, the warmth that made existence more than mere arrangement. Scripture does not explain where the Three came from, only that they simply *are*.

### Major Myths
List 2-3 stories featuring this deity:

1. **The First Gift:** When the first mortals knew hunger, the Shepherd descended and worked beside them—teaching them to plant, to harvest, to share. When they offered the first fruits back to the divine, the Shepherd wept with joy and blessed their fields forever.
2. **The Stranger's Test:** The Shepherd appears throughout Eldermyr's history as a humble traveler, testing hospitality. Those who share their last bread find their stores miraculously replenished; those who turn the stranger away find their abundance turning to ash.
3. **The Plague of Thornhall:** When pestilence struck the holy city, the Shepherd-priests stayed when all others fled, healing until they themselves fell. Legend says the Shepherd walked among them in those final days, personally receiving each faithful healer into eternal rest.

### Prophecies
Prophecies involving this deity:
- "When the flock is scattered, the Shepherd will gather them—but first they must learn to gather themselves."
- "Mercy shall have its voice, even in the court of the dead."

### Legendary Deeds
Famous divine actions:
1. Speaking Life at the creation of the world
2. Teaching mortals to cultivate rather than merely consume
3. Establishing the covenant that healing should be freely given

## History

### Rise to Power
The Shepherd has always existed as one of the Three—there was no rise, only eternal presence. The Shepherd's domain was established at creation itself.

### Major Events
1. **The First Harvest:** The Shepherd blessed the first successful cultivation, ending humanity's time as pure hunters
2. **The Plague Years:** A great illness swept Eldermyr; the Shepherd-priests' tireless healing established the Faith's hold on common folk
3. **[[The Great War]]:** The Shepherd's faithful tended wounded on both sides, maintaining mercy even in horror

### Current Era
The Shepherd's faithful are stretched to breaking. The succession crisis threatens war, which will bring wounds beyond any healer's capacity. The rising dead violate everything the Shepherd stands for—life corrupted, rest denied, communities shattered by horror. Shepherd-priests work alongside [[The Grey Wardens]] at [[The Ashen Fields]], providing what comfort they can to those who must fight the risen dead. Many are traumatized by what they've seen. The Shepherd's Path—the Western church faction—counsels peace and negotiation, but their voice grows weaker as all sides arm for war.

## Church & Organization

### Church Structure
Describe the organized religion:
- **Hierarchy:** Integrated with the larger Faith; Shepherd-priests form the largest faction of everyday clergy
- **Geographic spread:** Everywhere, but strongest in [[The Western Shore]] and rural villages throughout the realm
- **Political influence:** Less direct than Warden-priests, but the common folk's love gives them enormous moral authority

## Key Figures

### High Priest/Prophet
**Name:** Voice of Mercy Elara Brighthands
**Description:** An elderly woman who has spent forty years healing the sick and feeding the hungry. She counsels against war with every breath, but her influence wanes as houses arm for conflict. Some say she knows healing secrets that could cure even the risen dead—if anyone could get close enough to try.

### Champions
**Name:** [[Saint Aldwyn the Merciful]]
**Deeds:** During a famine, gave away everything including his own food; found dead with a smile, his stores somehow replenished overnight

### Saints
1. [[Saint Aldwyn the Merciful]] — Gave everything, received everything
2. Saint Mira of the Plague — Healed thousands before succumbing herself
3. Saint Brennan the Host — Never turned away a traveler; his inn is now a holy site

## Secrets

1. **The Shepherd weeps for what is coming.** Those rare souls who have received visions report not comfort but sorrow—the Shepherd sees the war ahead and grieves for both sides already.

2. **Some risen dead can still be reached.** The Shepherd's most powerful healing magic might restore souls trapped in risen bodies—but no one has survived close enough contact to try.

3. **The Shepherd's Path faction has been secretly negotiating between the houses.** They've come closer to preventing war than anyone knows—but [[House Karath]]'s involvement with [[The Unnamed]] may doom their efforts.

4. **The Shepherd may have known [[The Mad King]] before his madness.** Ancient texts suggest Valdus was once a devoted servant of mercy who turned to tyranny trying to protect his people from what he glimpsed.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Empty Hospital:** A Hospitaller house has been found abandoned, all the patients and healers vanished overnight. Investigation leads toward [[The Ashen Fields]].

2. **The Stranger's Test:** A humble traveler arrives at the party's camp seeking hospitality. They seem oddly knowing, and helping them leads to unexpected blessings—or refusing them brings subtle misfortune.

3. **The Mercy Mission:** The party is asked to escort a Voice of Mercy into [[House Karath]] territory for secret peace negotiations. The journey is dangerous; the negotiation, more so.

4. **The Healer's Choice:** A Shepherd-priest has discovered they can cure one risen soldier—returning them to true death and peaceful rest. But it requires sacrificing their own ability to heal forever. Will they do it? Should they?

### Divine Manifestation
The deity revealed—divinity made visible to mortal eyes.

**Prompt:**
> The Shepherd manifesting in a village struck by plague—a hooded figure whose face remains unseen but whose hands, extended from worn brown sleeves, glow with the warm light of a thousand hearth-fires. The figure moves through the sick and dying, and where those hands pass, color returns to grey faces, breath eases in labored chests, hope kindles in despairing eyes. The Shepherd's robe is simple homespun, patched and worn, the garment of someone who works rather than rules—yet it seems to contain all the warmth of every home that has ever welcomed a stranger. Around the divine form, wildflowers bloom in the cracks between cobblestones, the smell of fresh bread overpowers the stench of sickness, and even the dying smile as if remembering something precious. The village healer stands frozen, tears streaming, watching her patients rise from beds they were never expected to leave. The Shepherd pauses, one hand extended toward her—not to be worshipped, but to include her in the work. In mercy, partnership.

### Holy Symbol
The god's mark—divinity made wearable, worship made portable.

**Prompt:**
> The holy symbol of the Shepherd resting on a healer's worktable—two open hands carved in warm oak, extending from beneath the suggestion of a hooded cloak, the wood worn smooth by generations of faithful touch. The craftsmanship is simple but loving; every whorl and grain of the wood visible, the hands not idealized but worker's hands, capable and strong. The symbol sits among the tools of healing—mortar and pestle, dried herbs, clean bandages, a cup of water—as if it belongs there naturally, another instrument of mercy. Morning light falls through a small window, catching dust motes that seem to dance with particular warmth around the wooden hands. A small wildflower, placed as offering, rests in the cup of the palms. The room smells of healing herbs and bread from the kitchen below.
