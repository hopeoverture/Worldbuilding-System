# The Warden

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Warden is one of the Three equal gods of Eldermyr, representing divine order, justice, and legitimate authority. Unlike punishing gods of law, the Warden is neither cruel nor merciful—simply absolute. Justice is not revenge, but balance restored.

## Overview
The Warden stands as the divine embodiment of order, justice, and rightful rule—the pillar of civilization that separates law from chaos. Neither cruel nor merciful, the Warden represents the impartial scales upon which all deeds are weighed and the crown that legitimizes mortal authority. Rulers claim divine mandate through the Warden; oaths sworn in the Warden's name bind the swearer's soul; judges invoke the Warden when pronouncing sentence. The current succession crisis is, fundamentally, a crisis of the Warden's domain—for when the rightful ruler is uncertain, order itself begins to fray.

## Classification

### Divine Status
**Deity Type:** Greater God (co-equal with the Shepherd and Chronicler)

**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral

**Pantheon:** [[The Faith of the Three]]

### Domains
**Primary Domain:** Order and Justice
**Secondary Domains:**
- Rightful Rule and Sovereignty
- Oaths and Contracts
- Law and Civilization
- War (in service of legitimate authority)

**Cleric Domains (5e):** Order, War

### Portfolio
What aspects of existence does this deity govern?
- The legitimacy of kings and lords
- The binding power of oaths and contracts
- The administration of justice
- The maintenance of social order
- Wars fought for righteous cause
- The boundary between civilization and chaos

## Divine Nature

### Appearance
The Warden manifests as a towering, stern figure of indeterminate gender—sometimes appearing male, sometimes female, sometimes neither—wearing a crown of cold iron and armor that seems forged from solidified authority itself. One hand holds the scales of justice, perfectly balanced; the other grips a blade that has never been drawn in anger, only in righteous judgment. The Warden's face is carved from the same unyielding certainty as mountains, and their eyes see through every lie, every excuse, every hidden truth. Where the Warden stands, the very air feels heavier, more certain, as if probability itself has been replaced with inevitability.

### Personality
The Warden does not comfort, but neither does the Warden condemn unfairly. Every soul receives exactly what they have earned—no more, no less. The Warden's justice is absolute because it is impersonal; there is no favoritism, no mercy that bends the law, no cruelty that exceeds what punishment is due. To mortals, this can seem cold, but the Warden sees the larger pattern: without order, there can be no peace; without law, the strong devour the weak; without legitimate authority, civilization crumbles into chaos.

### Values
What does this deity value?
- Legitimate authority exercised with wisdom
- Oaths kept regardless of personal cost
- Justice administered without favoritism
- Order that serves the common good, not tyranny
- The rule of law over the rule of strength

### Goals
What does this deity want?
- The restoration of rightful rule in Eldermyr—though which claimant is "rightful" the Warden does not reveal
- The maintenance of the covenant that binds divine and mortal realms

### Flaws
What are the deity's weaknesses or blind spots?
- The Warden cannot bend—even when bending might serve greater justice, the letter of divine law must be upheld
- Legitimate authority can become tyranny, and the Warden struggles to distinguish between order that serves and order that oppresses

## Symbols & Sacred Items

### With Other Pantheons
Relationships with gods outside the pantheon:

### With Mortals
The Warden views mortals as subjects of cosmic law—not with affection, but with the same impartial regard a magistrate shows all who enter the court. The righteous have nothing to fear; the guilty will be found.

### Divine Realm
**Name:** The Court Eternal
**Description:** An infinite judgment hall of grey marble and cold iron, where every case that was ever disputed echoes in the silence
**Location in Cosmology:** One aspect of the Eternal Halls, shared with the other Two

## Mythology

### Origin
The Warden emerged at creation as one of the Three who spoke the First Words. While the Shepherd spoke Life and the Chronicler spoke Memory, the Warden spoke Order—the structure that gave chaos form, the law that allowed existence to be sustained. Scripture does not explain where the Three came from, only that they simply *are*.

### Major Myths
List 2-3 stories featuring this deity:

1. **The First Judgment:** When the first murder occurred—Cain slaying Abel in Eldermyr's mythology—the Warden descended to pronounce sentence. The punishment was exile rather than death, establishing that justice seeks restoration where possible, destruction only when necessary.
2. **The Binding of Tyrants:** When an ancient king declared himself above divine law, the Warden appeared in his throne room and removed his crown with a touch. The king's legitimacy vanished; within a year, his own guards deposed him.
3. **The Oathkeeper's Rest:** When a knight kept a terrible oath at the cost of everything he loved, the Warden appeared at his death and personally escorted him to eternal reward—demonstrating that the Warden honors what the Warden demands.

### Prophecies
Prophecies involving this deity:
- "When the crown is refused by crown, the Warden's silence speaks loudest." (Interpreted by some as relating to [[The Iron Crown]]'s rejection of all claimants)
- "The scales shall tip when the dead no longer rest, for justice cannot be done to those who will not stay judged."

### Legendary Deeds
Famous divine actions:
1. Speaking Order at the creation of the world
2. Establishing the legitimacy of the first High King of Eldermyr
3. Withdrawing from a king who became a tyrant, ending his divine mandate

## History

### Rise to Power
The Warden has always existed as one of the Three—there was no rise, only eternal presence. The Warden's domain was established at creation itself.

### Major Events
1. **The First Coronation:** The Warden blessed the first High King, establishing the tradition of divine mandate
2. **The Tyrant's Fall:** When King Aldric I became cruel, the Warden's priests proclaimed him no longer legitimate—he was overthrown within a season
3. **The Mad King's Reign:** [[The Mad King|Valdus I]] claimed the Warden's blessing for his purges. The Warden's response was silence—interpreted by both sides as support.

### Current Era
The Warden's domain is in crisis. [[The Iron Crown]] has rejected all claimants—an unprecedented sign that divine mandate cannot be determined. The succession dispute has Warden-priests on opposite sides, each claiming their candidate is legitimate. Some whisper that the Warden has abandoned Eldermyr; others believe the silence is itself a test. The Warden's Hand—the Eastern church faction—supports [[House Thorne]]'s claim that blood alone does not make a king; strength and capability matter. But no one knows what the Warden truly wills.

## Church & Organization

### Church Structure
Describe the organized religion:
- **Hierarchy:** Integrated with the larger Faith; Warden-priests form a specialized order within the Synod
- **Geographic spread:** Strongest in [[The Eastern March]]; present wherever courts convene
- **Political influence:** Enormous—judges are typically Warden-priests; coronations require their blessing; oaths are witnessed by them

### Religious Orders

| The Crown's Voice | Advising rulers, political legitimacy | Currently paralyzed by succession crisis |

## Key Figures

### High Priest/Prophet
**Name:** Lord Justice Thadeus Ironhand
**Description:** The highest-ranking Warden-priest in the Synod, Thadeus has refused to bless any claimant to the throne until the Warden's will is made clear. This has made him enemies on all sides—but no one can question his impartiality.

### Champions
**Name:** [[Saint Kira of the Blade]]
**Deeds:** Stood alone for seven days against darkness, granted the Warden's strength to prevail

### Saints
1. [[Saint Kira of the Blade]] — The Warden's Sword, champion of righteous war
2. Saint Aldric the Just — A judge who pronounced sentence on his own son for murder

## Secrets

1. **The Warden's silence on the succession is deliberate.** The deity is testing whether Eldermyr's institutions can determine legitimacy without divine intervention—or whether they will fail.

2. **[[The Iron Crown]]'s rejection of all claimants means something the priests don't understand.** The crown was forged with the Warden's blessing; its refusal suggests the "rightful heir" hasn't yet presented themselves—or the covenant itself is broken.

3. **The Warden may know what [[The Unnamed]] truly is.** Ancient texts suggest the Warden spoke Order specifically to bind something that predated chaos—something that wanted to remain unordered.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The False Oath:** An important contract was sworn in the Warden's name, but one party claims they were coerced. The Warden-priests must determine whether coerced oaths bind—and the answer will have political consequences.

2. **The Tyrant's Heir:** A claimant with a strong legal claim has ruled cruelly in their own domain. Can the Warden's blessing be withdrawn before coronation?

3. **The Silent Judge:** A legendary Arbiter of Truth has stopped speaking—and stopped detecting lies. What happened to their divine gift?

4. **Crown's Rejection:** The party is tasked with discovering why [[The Iron Crown]] refuses all claimants. The answer may lie in the Warden's ancient compact with the first kings.

### Divine Manifestation
The deity revealed—divinity made visible to mortal eyes.

**Prompt:**
> The Warden manifesting in the great judgment hall of Aldersgate at the moment of contested succession—a towering figure of absolute authority whose form seems carved from the concept of law itself. The Warden's armor is grey steel that has never known battle because it represents authority that needs no violence, their crown cold iron that rests with the weight of every legitimate kingdom, their face neither male nor female but simply *certain*—eyes that have witnessed every lie ever spoken and every truth ever hidden. In one hand, the scales of justice hang perfectly balanced despite the chaos of the mortal world; in the other, a sword rests sheathed, for judgment has been pronounced but not yet executed. Around the divine form, the very architecture seems to straighten, shadows falling at proper angles, chaos retreating to the corners. Below, the gathered lords and claimants have fallen silent, their arguments meaningless in the presence of the one whose blessing they seek. The air tastes of iron and oaths.

### Holy Symbol
The god's mark—divinity made wearable, worship made portable.

**Prompt:**
> The holy symbol of the Warden resting on a judge's bench in the court of Aldersgate—a crown of cold iron positioned above crossed scales and sword, rendered in steel and silver with the precise craftsmanship of the Forgemasters. The crown is simple but heavy, lacking jewels but carrying the weight of legitimate authority; the scales beneath hang in perfect balance, each pan engraved with ancient law; the sword crosses behind, sheathed, for the Warden's justice requires enforcement only when defied. The metalwork catches the cold morning light through the court's high windows, casting precise shadows across the polished wooden bench. Around it, the tools of mortal justice—gavels, seals, law books—seem lesser, derivative, pale reflections of the divine truth the symbol represents. The air itself feels heavier near it, pregnant with the expectation of honest testimony.
