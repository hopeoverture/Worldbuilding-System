# Ashen Hound

## Overview
Ashen Hounds are the reanimated remains of war dogs and mastiffs that served alongside soldiers during [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. Unlike human risen dead, these undead canines retain much of their predatory instincts and serve as scouts, trackers, and hunters for the undead army. They range farther from [[The Ashen Fields]] than most risen dead, appearing at the cursed boundary to drag victims back to the mass graves.

## Traits

### Keen Hearing and Smell
The Ashen Hound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

### Pack Tactics
The Ashen Hound has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the hound's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Ashen Loyalty
The Ashen Hound cannot be turned or controlled by anyone other than the entity wearing [[The Blackened Crown]].

### Corpse Tracker
The Ashen Hound can track any creature that has been dead and returned to life within 1 mile. It knows the direction of the nearest such creature at all times.

### Drag to the Grave
When the Ashen Hound reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a bite attack, it can immediately move up to half its speed while dragging the unconscious creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

## Actions

### Bite
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Haunting Howl (1/Day)
The Ashen Hound lets out an unearthly howl. Each creature within 30 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Other undead within 300 feet that hear the howl are alerted to the presence of prey.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Ashen Hounds resemble large war mastiffs in advanced decay—ribs visible beneath patchy fur, eyes glowing with the amber light common to [[The Ashen Fields]]' undead. Their collars and barding (if they wore any) remain fused to their bodies. Many still bear the wounds that killed them: arrow punctures, sword slashes, burns from magical fire. Their fur is matted with grave dirt and ash, and their jaws are stained with old, dark blood.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Low growling, snuffling, the scrape of claws on stone
- **Smell:** Wet dog, decay, grave earth
- **Temperature effects:** Unnatural chill
- **Magical aura:** Faint necromantic energy

## Behavior

### Temperament
Ashen Hounds retain the loyalty and pack instincts of living war dogs, but directed now toward the undead army. They are relentless trackers who will pursue prey for miles, returning to [[The Ashen Fields]] only when they have something to drag back or have lost the trail. They are more cunning than [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]] and can set ambushes.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Animal (cunning)

While not truly intelligent, Ashen Hounds retain strong instincts and the training they received in life. They can follow complex commands, work in packs, and recognize threats.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Track by scent, ambush, pack tactics
- **Preferred prey:** Wounded creatures, lone travelers, anything that runs
- **Feeding frequency:** Do not feed; sustained by the curse
- **Territory size:** Up to 5 miles from [[The Ashen Fields]] boundary

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Pack (3-8 hounds)

Ashen Hounds operate in packs led by a dominant individual. They coordinate attacks and share prey (dragging victims back together).

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Edges of [[The Ashen Fields]], approaching trade routes
- **Climate preferences:** The cursed chill of the battlefield
- **Shelter requirements:** None; often seen patrolling
- **Territory characteristics:** The expanding cursed boundary

### Range
Up to 5 miles beyond the boundary of [[The Ashen Fields]]—farther than most risen dead can venture.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Rise from graves of war dogs
- **Maturation time:** Immediate
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

### Role in Ecosystem
Scouts and hunters for the undead army. They locate living prey and either drag it back or summon other undead with their howls.

## Lore

### Origins
The armies of [[The Great War]] employed war dogs extensively—tracking, guarding, and fighting alongside their handlers. When the curse took hold, the dogs rose with their masters, their loyalty redirected to the dark power at [[The Ashen Fields]]' heart.

### History
Ashen Hounds were among the first undead reported outside [[The Ashen Fields]] proper. Farmers at the boundary found their livestock missing, then their farmhands. The hounds were dragging victims back to the mass graves.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** They can track the living for miles.
2. **True:** Their howls summon other undead.
3. **False:** They only hunt at night. (They are active at all times.)

### Known Individuals
1. **Reaper** — A massive mastiff, formerly belonging to a Karath general. Leads the largest pack.
2. **The Brindle Pack** — Seven hounds that hunt together near [[Volkovka]], known for their coordinated ambushes.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Ashen Hounds prefer ambush tactics, using their stealth and scent abilities to track prey and attack from hiding. They use Pack Tactics to gain advantage, knock targets prone with their bite, then use Drag to the Grave to remove incapacitated victims from the fight. Haunting Howl is used early to frighten prey and summon allies.

### Strengths
- Excellent tracking abilities
- Pack Tactics provides consistent advantage
- Can drag unconscious victims away
- Faster than humanoid risen dead

### Weaknesses
- Lower HP than larger undead
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Can be distracted by strong scents
- Killing pack leader may scatter others

### Group Tactics
Packs of 3-5 hounds surround prey, with one using Haunting Howl while others attack. They focus on knocking targets prone and dragging them away from allies.

## Treasure

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Boundary Patrol:** The party is ambushed by a pack of Ashen Hounds while traveling near [[The Ashen Fields]]' edge.

2. **Missing Persons:** Villagers have been disappearing near the cursed boundary. The party must track the Ashen Hounds to their "dump site" and discover where they've been taking victims.

3. **Warning Howl:** The party hears an Ashen Hound's howl in the distance. They have minutes before more undead arrive.

4. **Rescue Mission:** An ally has been dragged unconscious toward [[The Ashen Fields]]. The party must catch the Ashen Hound pack before they reach the mass graves.
