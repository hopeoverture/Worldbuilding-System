# Ashen Revenant

## Overview
Ashen Revenants are the vengeful spirits of soldiers who died with oaths unfulfilled or victims of betrayal during [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. Unlike other risen dead who simply reenact their deaths, Revenants actively seek specific targets—the houses, bloodlines, or individuals responsible for their deaths. They are intelligent, relentless hunters who can track their prey across [[The Karath Reach]] and beyond, returning within days even if destroyed until their vengeance is complete or the curse is lifted.

## Traits

### Incorporeal Movement
The Ashen Revenant can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### Regeneration
The Ashen Revenant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the Revenant takes radiant damage or damage from a holy weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The Revenant is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

### Rejuvenation
When the Ashen Revenant is destroyed, it reforms within 24 hours in [[The Ashen Fields]] with all its hit points, unless its vengeance is fulfilled or [[The Blackened Crown]] is destroyed. The Revenant knows the location of its target.

### Vengeful Tracker
The Ashen Revenant knows the direction and distance to any creature it has sworn vengeance against, as long as both are on the same plane. This sense extends to descendants of its original target if the target has died.

### Ashen Loyalty
The Ashen Revenant cannot be turned or controlled by anyone other than the entity wearing [[The Blackened Crown]].

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Ashen Revenant makes two attacks with its spectral weapon.

### Spectral Weapon
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

### Vengeful Glare
The Revenant targets one creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is the Revenant's sworn enemy (or their descendant), they have disadvantage on this save.

## Reactions

### Deathless Pursuit
When a creature the Revenant can see moves more than 30 feet away from it, the Revenant can use its reaction to move up to its speed toward that creature.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Ashen Revenants appear as translucent, ghostly figures wreathed in gray ash and faint flame. Their features are recognizable but distorted by hatred—faces frozen in expressions of rage or anguish. They wear the spectral echoes of their armor and carry weapons of solidified shadow and hate. Their eyes burn not amber like other risen dead, but a cold, pale blue that fixes on their targets with unblinking intensity. Wounds that killed them are visible as dark, bleeding shadows on their forms.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Echoing accusations, whispered names, the crackle of spectral flame
- **Smell:** Ash, cold iron, the memory of blood
- **Temperature effects:** Severe, bone-deep cold; breath frosts; water freezes
- **Magical aura:** Strong necromantic energy with undertones of divine justice

## Behavior

### Temperament
Ashen Revenants are utterly focused on their sworn enemies. They will pursue their targets to the exclusion of all else, fighting through any obstacle. However, they can be cunning—if their target is well-protected, they may stalk them for days, striking at vulnerable moments. They do not speak except to accuse, condemn, or name their targets.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Sapient (focused)

Revenants retain full intelligence from their lives, but their minds are narrowed to a single purpose: vengeance. They can plan, strategize, and adapt, but cannot be reasoned with or distracted from their goal.

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Solitary

Each Revenant pursues its own vengeance independently. They do not cooperate unless their targets overlap.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Anywhere their target goes; formed at sites of betrayal
- **Climate preferences:** None; immune to environmental effects

### Range
Unlimited within the material plane while pursuing vengeance. Cannot leave [[The Ashen Fields]] without a target.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Rise from those who died with oaths unfulfilled or victims of significant betrayal
- **Maturation time:** Immediate upon rising
- **Lifespan:** Until vengeance is fulfilled or [[The Blackened Crown]] is destroyed

## Lore

### Origins
The soldiers who died at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] included many who were betrayed—stabbed in the back by supposed allies, abandoned by commanders, or killed by those they trusted. The curse of [[The Blackened Crown]] seized upon their dying rage and gave it form. Now they hunt the bloodlines of those who wronged them.

### History
The first Ashen Revenant appeared outside [[Porto Valdris]] six weeks after the rising began—the ghost of a Karath captain murdered by Valdren allies during the battle's chaos. It killed four members of House Valdren's extended family before being driven off. It has returned three times since.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** They cannot be permanently destroyed while their vengeance is unfulfilled.
2. **True:** Fulfilling their oath (killing their target) releases them.
3. **Partially True:** Holy ground can bar them—but not indefinitely, and not if their target is on it.

### Known Individuals
1. **Captain Pyotr Volkov** — A Karath captain betrayed by his own men who had been bribed by [[House Valdren]]. He hunts the descendants of those soldiers.
2. **Dame Aleksandra Crane** — A Valdren knight who died when [[House Thorne]] forces violated a temporary truce. She targets anyone with Thorne blood.
3. **The Oathbreaker's Shadow** — A revenant whose identity is unknown. It hunts members of [[The Faith of the Three]], suggesting a priest broke sanctuary.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Ashen Revenants open with Vengeful Glare to frighten and isolate their primary target, then pursue relentlessly with Spectral Weapon attacks. They use Incorporeal Movement to bypass obstacles and Deathless Pursuit to prevent escape. They ignore non-targets unless actively obstructed.

### Strengths
- Regeneration makes them extremely durable
- Rejuvenation means killing them is temporary
- Vengeful Tracker means running is useless
- Incorporeal Movement bypasses most defenses
- Immune to many conditions

### Weaknesses
- Radiant damage suppresses regeneration
- Holy weapons suppress regeneration
- Fulfilling their vengeance destroys them permanently
- Focused on targets; may ignore other threats
- Can be temporarily destroyed, buying time

### Group Tactics
Revenants rarely work together, but if multiple target the same group, they coordinate attacks on different targets simultaneously, preventing the party from protecting any one person.

## Treasure

### Body Parts
Ashen Revenants leave no physical remains when destroyed. If permanently killed:
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Revenant Essence | 100 gp | Powerful necromantic component |
| Oath Fragment | 75 gp | Can be used to bind or break oaths |
| Vengeance Spark | 50 gp | Component for curses or retribution magic |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Old Debts:** A revenant appears, targeting a party member's noble patron. It speaks the name of a great-great-grandfather and demands the debt be paid.

2. **The Accuser:** An Ashen Revenant confronts the party in the street, accusing one of them of being descended from a traitor. Is it right? Does it matter?

3. **Protection Detail:** [[House Valdren]] hires the party to protect a merchant from an Ashen Revenant. The merchant insists his family did nothing wrong. The Revenant says otherwise.

4. **Breaking the Oath:** The party learns a Revenant can be permanently destroyed if its vengeance is fulfilled—but that means letting it kill its target, an innocent descendant.

### Full Creature (The Hunter)
**Prompt:**
An Ashen Revenant hovering three feet above the cursed ground of the Ashen Fields, one of the vengeful spirits born from the Great War's betrayals. The creature is medium-sized but looms larger through sheer presence—a spectral warrior whose translucent form is wreathed in drifting gray ash and pale flame that gives off no heat, only bone-deep cold. The face is recognizable as human but distorted by hatred that has burned for twenty-three years: features frozen in an expression of absolute rage, mouth set in a permanent snarl, every line speaking of oaths broken and vengeance demanded. This was once a soldier—a Karath captain, perhaps, or a Valdren knight—and the ghostly echoes of their military armor are visible: a breastplate bearing a house sigil now illegible, pauldrons, a helm pushed back to reveal the accusing face. The death wound is visible as a dark shadow bleeding darkness from the throat—where a supposed ally's blade struck during a truce violation. The eyes burn with pale cold blue fire, not the amber of lesser undead but something more: intelligence, purpose, hatred that transcends death. In spectral hands, the Revenant grips a greatsword made of solidified shadow and hate, the weapon an extension of its endless need for revenge. Ash and mist swirl around the hovering figure as if drawn to its presence. The air frosts visibly around it—breath visible, water freezing on nearby surfaces. In the background, the gray battlefield stretches away with its mass graves, but the Revenant's eyes are fixed on something in the distance: its target, whose bloodline it will hunt until vengeance is complete or the curse is broken. The atmosphere of focused malevolence, of a spirit that cannot rest and will not stop.

### Vengeful Glare (Action Shot)
**Prompt:**
Close-up of an Ashen Revenant's face in the moment of using Vengeful Glare against its sworn enemy, pale blue eyes blazing with cold intensity that burns into the soul. The ghostly features are twisted in accusation, mouth open to speak a name—the name of a betrayer, or their descendant, pronounced with a voice that echoes across dimensions. The face shows the soldier this spirit once was: human, possibly noble, definitely betrayed, now reduced to purpose given spectral form. Translucent flesh reveals the suggestion of skull beneath, the boundary between ghost and skeleton blurring as rage intensifies. The death wound at the throat pulses with darkness, shadow bleeding outward like smoke from a wound that will never heal. Spectral flames and drifting ash swirl around the head, caught in an unfelt wind. In the reflection of those burning blue eyes, barely visible, is the target: a living person, possibly a descendant who never knew what their ancestor did during the Great War, now facing judgment for a crime they didn't commit. Frost crystals form in the air between Revenant and victim. The background is darkness and mist, the mortal world fading as the spirit's will dominates perception. The atmosphere of supernatural accusation, of vengeance that transcends generations, of debts that death cannot erase.

### Dame Aleksandra Crane (Named Revenant)
**Prompt:**
The Ashen Revenant known as Dame Aleksandra Crane, one of the most feared spirits hunting the descendants of House Thorne, manifesting outside a nobleman's manor at midnight. In life, she was a Valdren knight—her spectral form still wears the elaborate armor of a female knight with the golden dolphin of House Valdren visible on her ghostly breastplate. She died when Thorne forces violated a temporary truce during the Battle of Ashen Fields, cut down while her weapon was sheathed in good faith. Now she hunts anyone with Thorne blood, appearing outside their homes in the dead of night, pointing at their windows with a spectral sword, speaking their names in a voice that carries through walls. Her face was beautiful once—high cheekbones, strong jaw, the bearing of nobility—now frozen in the anguish of betrayal, tears of frost trailing down translucent cheeks. The wound that killed her is visible: a blade through the back, emerging from her chest, the shadow of steel still lodged in spectral flesh. She hovers before a Thorne manor, ash swirling around her, the ground freezing beneath her presence, pointing at an upper window where a frightened face peers out. She has appeared to this family three times. Each time, she takes another member. The atmosphere of personal haunting, of a debt that will be paid no matter how many generations it takes.
