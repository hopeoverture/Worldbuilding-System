# Corpse Amalgam

## Overview
Corpse Amalgams are nightmarish horrors formed when the curse of [[The Ashen Fields]] fuses multiple corpses into a single, writhing mass of limbs, weapons, and hate. These abominations rise from the deepest mass graves and the Ash Pits where [[The Mad King]]'s failed rituals created the most concentrated necrotic energy. A Corpse Amalgam is not one soldier but many—a dozen or more bodies twisted together, their weapons jutting from the mass, their faces frozen in endless screams.

## Traits

### Undead Fortitude
If damage reduces the Corpse Amalgam to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the Corpse Amalgam drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Many Bodies, One Horror
The Corpse Amalgam has advantage on saving throws against being stunned. When the Amalgam takes 30 or more damage in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or split into two smaller Amalgams (use **Corpse Pile** stat block below). Both new creatures act on the original's initiative.

### Ashen Loyalty
The Corpse Amalgam cannot be turned or controlled by anyone other than the entity wearing [[The Blackened Crown]].

### Absorb the Fallen
When a creature dies within 10 feet of the Corpse Amalgam, the Amalgam can use its reaction to absorb the body. It regains 15 hit points and the body is destroyed.

### Aura of Horror
Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the Corpse Amalgam must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds is immune to this Amalgam's Aura of Horror for 24 hours.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Corpse Amalgam makes three attacks: one with its Slam and two with Grasping Limbs.

### Slam
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

### Grasping Limbs
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 16). The Amalgam can grapple up to two creatures at once.

### Rend (Recharge 5-6)
The Corpse Amalgam tears into all creatures within 10 feet. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## Bonus Actions

### Crush
One creature grappled by the Amalgam takes 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
A Corpse Amalgam is a horror of fused flesh—a writhing mass of limbs, torsos, and heads merged into a single creature roughly 10 feet tall and 8 feet wide. Arms reach out at random angles, legs drag uselessly or kick at air, faces emerge from the mass only to sink back in. Weapons and armor fragments jut from the body: swords embedded hilt-deep, helmets crushed into shoulders, chainmail fused with bone. The creature moves by rolling, dragging, and pulling itself forward with its many arms. It has no single face—dozens of eyes, open mouths, and expressions of eternal agony cover its surface.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Wet squelching, grinding bone, overlapping screams and moans
- **Smell:** Overwhelming rot, old blood, exposed viscera
- **Temperature effects:** Unnatural warmth from decomposition
- **Magical aura:** Strong, chaotic necromantic energy

## Behavior

### Temperament
Corpse Amalgams are driven by hunger and rage in equal measure. They seek living flesh to absorb, attacking the nearest targets without tactics or preference. Their movements are erratic—sometimes lurching, sometimes flowing, sometimes thrashing. The screams of their component corpses never stop.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Mindless (instinctual)

No intelligence remains in a Corpse Amalgam. It is pure animated horror, responding only to the presence of the living and the commands of [[The Blackened Crown]].

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Charge toward living creatures, grapple, absorb
- **Preferred prey:** Any living creature
- **Feeding frequency:** Continuous when prey available
- **Territory size:** Roams [[The Ashen Fields]] randomly

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Solitary

Corpse Amalgams do not cooperate or communicate. If two encounter each other, they ignore one another unless commanded.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Mass graves, Ash Pits, concentrated curse zones
- **Climate preferences:** None
- **Shelter requirements:** None; sometimes partially buried
- **Territory characteristics:** Areas of highest necrotic concentration

### Range
[[The Ashen Fields]], particularly the Ash Pits and deepest mass graves.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Form spontaneously in areas of extreme necrotic concentration, or when multiple risen dead are destroyed close together
- **Maturation time:** Immediate
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

### Role in Ecosystem
Corpse Amalgams are a symptom of the curse's worst corruption. They grow by absorbing more dead, potentially becoming larger and more dangerous over time. Unchecked, a single Amalgam could consume an entire battlefield's worth of corpses.

## Lore

### Origins
The Ash Pits of [[The Ashen Fields]] were created when [[The Mad King]]'s necromantic rituals went catastrophically wrong, killing hundreds of his own soldiers in waves of corrupted magic. The bodies fell atop one another, and the curse fused them together. The first Corpse Amalgams rose from these pits—abominations that should not exist.

### History
The first Amalgam was encountered by [[The Grey Wardens]] four weeks ago. Six Wardens died before they understood what they were facing. The survivor described "a wall of screaming meat that would not stop."

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** Killing creatures near an Amalgam makes it stronger.
2. **True:** They can split into smaller horrors when badly wounded.
3. **False:** Fire destroys them permanently. (It only deals normal damage.)

### Known Individuals
Corpse Amalgams have no individual identity, but some have been given names by traumatized survivors:
1. **The Marching Mass** — An Amalgam seen moving across [[The Ashen Fields]] in a straight line, absorbing any dead in its path.
2. **The Pit Dweller** — A particularly large Amalgam that has never left the deepest Ash Pit. [[The Grey Wardens]] believe it may be the original.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Corpse Amalgams charge the nearest living creature and attack with Multiattack, attempting to grapple at least one target to use Crush. They use Rend when surrounded by multiple enemies. They prioritize absorbing fresh corpses when available, healing themselves mid-combat.

### Strengths
- High HP (115) and damage output
- Absorb the Fallen provides combat healing
- Can grapple multiple targets
- Rend deals area damage
- Splits when damaged enough

### Weaknesses
- Low AC (13) and slow speed (25 ft.)
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- No ranged attacks
- Mindless; cannot adapt tactics
- Splitting reduces overall threat

### Group Tactics
Corpse Amalgams do not coordinate. If multiple attack the same area, it's coincidence rather than planning.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
Corpse Amalgams carry nothing, but embedded in their bodies might be found:
- Weapons and armor fragments (heavily damaged)
- Personal effects of absorbed soldiers (coins, rings, lockets)
- Occasionally magical items that survived the fusion (20% chance per Amalgam)

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Amalgam Essence | 50 gp | Component for mass-affect necromancy |
| Fused Bone | 25 gp | Crafting material for undead-related items |
| Screaming Heart | 75 gp | Powers items that cause fear |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **The Growing Threat:** A Corpse Amalgam has been absorbing corpses from mass graves. Each day it grows larger. The party must destroy it before it becomes unstoppable.

2. **The Pit Dive:** Something valuable fell into an Ash Pit. The party must descend past the Pit Dweller to retrieve it.

3. **Battlefield Cleanup:** After a skirmish with risen dead, the party realizes the corpses are crawling toward each other. If they don't destroy or separate them, an Amalgam will form.

4. **Escort Through Hell:** The party must escort a wagon across [[The Ashen Fields]]. A Corpse Amalgam intercepts them on open ground with no cover.

## Notes
- The splitting mechanic creates tactical decisions—focus fire vs. area damage
- Absorb the Fallen rewards killing minions away from the Amalgam
- These are the "boss monster" version of standard risen dead
- The Pit Dweller may be a larger variant (increase size to Huge, CR 8+)
