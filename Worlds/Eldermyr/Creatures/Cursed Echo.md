# Cursed Echo

## Overview
Cursed Echoes are the weakest spiritual undead found in [[The Ashen Fields]]—not truly spirits but psychic impressions left by traumatic deaths, given form by the curse. They appear as translucent, flickering images of soldiers endlessly reliving their final moments: charging, falling, dying, then resetting to charge again. While individually weak, their presence is deeply unsettling, and they can drain the life force of those who disturb their eternal replay.

## Traits

### Incorporeal Movement
The Cursed Echo can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### Ephemeral
The Cursed Echo cannot interact with or affect the physical world except through its attacks and abilities.

### Death Loop
The Cursed Echo is trapped in an endless replay of its death. At the start of each of its turns, roll 1d6. On a 1-2, the Echo ignores all creatures and simply repeats its death sequence (moving in a predetermined pattern and "dying"). On a 3-6, it perceives nearby creatures as enemies from its final battle and attacks.

### Sunlight Weakness
While in sunlight, the Cursed Echo has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

## Actions

### Echoing Touch
*Melee Spell Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

### Death Memory (Recharge 6)
The Cursed Echo forces a creature within 30 feet to experience its death. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage and be frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn't frightened.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Cursed Echoes appear as translucent, flickering images of soldiers—their forms shift between moments of their final battle like a broken loop of memory. One moment they are charging, the next falling, the next already dead, then resetting. Their features are indistinct, faces lost to the blur of repeated motion. They glow faintly with pale gray-blue light, brightest at the moments of their deaths. Wounds appear and disappear as the loop cycles.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Distant battle cries, screams, the clash of phantom weapons (all muted, echoing)
- **Smell:** None
- **Temperature effects:** Mild chill
- **Magical aura:** Faint necromantic energy; detectable as "residual" rather than "active"

## Behavior

### Temperament
Cursed Echoes have no true temperament—they are recordings, not beings. They replay their deaths endlessly, only becoming "aware" of the present when something disrupts the loop. Even then, they perceive the world through the lens of their final battle, attacking anyone they don't recognize as allies (which is everyone).

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Mindless (fragmented memory)

No true intelligence remains. Cursed Echoes cannot learn, adapt, or communicate meaningfully. They are psychic scars, not spirits.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Do not hunt; attack when their loop is disrupted
- **Preferred prey:** None; attack indiscriminately when triggered
- **Feeding frequency:** Do not feed
- **Territory size:** Fixed to the location of their death (30-50 ft. radius)

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** None

Cursed Echoes do not interact with each other. Multiple Echoes in the same area replay independently, creating a chaotic overlay of phantom battles.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Sites of traumatic death, particularly battlefields
- **Climate preferences:** None
- **Shelter requirements:** Bound to death location
- **Territory characteristics:** Areas where many died violently

### Range
Fixed to the location of their death. Cannot move more than 50 feet from where they died.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Form spontaneously at sites of mass trauma
- **Maturation time:** May take years to manifest after death
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite until the curse is lifted or they are destroyed

### Role in Ecosystem
Cursed Echoes are symptoms of the curse's presence. Their density indicates how much death occurred in an area. They serve no function in the undead army—they are simply side effects.

## Lore

### Origins
Cursed Echoes are not raised by [[The Blackened Crown]] like other risen dead. They are psychic residue—the trauma of violent death impressed upon the cursed land itself. They began appearing within a year of [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], first mistaken for ghosts or hauntings.

### History
Travelers have reported Cursed Echoes throughout [[The Ashen Fields]], often describing the disturbing experience of walking through phantom battles—soldiers fighting, dying, and resetting around them. Those who disturb the Echoes find them suddenly, terrifyingly aware.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** They are not true spirits—they cannot be communicated with or reasoned with.
2. **True:** They are bound to the location of their death and cannot leave.
3. **False:** Giving them a proper burial releases them. (They are not souls; they are echoes.)

### Known Individuals
Cursed Echoes have no individual identity. Some locations are known for particularly dense or disturbing Echoes:
1. **The Charge Line** — Where the final cavalry charge occurred. Dozens of Echoes replay the charge endlessly.
2. **The Command Tent** — Echoes of officers arguing, then being cut down when the line broke.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
When triggered (determined by Death Loop), Cursed Echoes attack the nearest creature with Echoing Touch, perceiving them as enemies from their final battle. They use Death Memory when recharged, forcing targets to experience their death. They do not coordinate, retreat, or adapt.

### Strengths
- Incorporeal (resistant to most damage)
- Death Memory can frighten and damage
- Cannot be reasoned with or intimidated

### Weaknesses
- Death Loop means they may ignore combat
- Weak (low HP, low damage)
- Sunlight Weakness
- Bound to location; cannot pursue

### Group Tactics
Multiple Echoes attack independently with no coordination. This makes them chaotic and somewhat unpredictable, but not tactically dangerous.

## Treasure

### Body Parts
Cursed Echoes leave no remains. However, the locations they haunt may contain:
- Equipment of the original soldiers (corroded but identifiable)
- Personal effects (coins, letters, insignia)
- Occasionally magical items that survived

## Encounter Ideas

1. **The Phantom Battle:** The party must cross an area dense with Cursed Echoes. They can try to avoid triggering them or fight through.

2. **Witness to the Past:** A Cursed Echo's Death Memory shows the party a fragment of what really happened at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]—something the histories don't record.

3. **Disturbing the Dead:** An artifact lies in the center of a cluster of Echoes. Retrieving it will certainly trigger them.

4. **The Peaceful Dead:** Strangely, one cluster of Echoes never attacks. They're praying. What were they doing when they died?

## Image Prompts

### Full Creature
**Prompt:**
> Medium translucent ghostly figure of a soldier mid-charge, flickering between moments—now running, now falling, now lying dead, superimposed on each other like a broken film loop. Pale gray-blue glow emanating from the form. Features indistinct, lost to motion blur. Phantom weapon raised then lowered then raised. Wounds appearing and disappearing. Battlefield of ash and gray visible through the translucent form. Other faint Echoes visible in the distance, each trapped in their own loop.

### Detail/Action Shot
**Prompt:**
> Close-up of Cursed Echo using Death Memory, face suddenly clear as it turns toward the viewer, mouth open in a silent scream. The moment of death frozen and projected—arrow in chest, expression of shock and agony. Translucent form pulsing with pale blue light. Target in foreground clutching head, experiencing the death. Psychic energy visible as distortion between Echo and victim. Background blurred but suggesting battlefield. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.

## Notes
- These are "ambient" undead—environmental hazards as much as monsters
- Death Loop makes them unpredictable; roll each turn
- They provide atmosphere and context about [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]
- Not controlled by [[The Blackened Crown]]; they're side effects
