# Dread Commander

## Overview
Dread Commanders are the elite generals of the undead army rising from [[The Ashen Fields]]—former high-ranking officers whose tactical brilliance survived death. Unlike [[Risen Officer|Risen Officers]], these undead retain true intelligence, the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, and a cruel cunning that makes them far more dangerous than mere reanimated soldiers. They wear crowns of blackened iron, lesser echoes of [[The Blackened Crown]], and serve as the voice and will of [[The Mad King|the Figure at the Heart]].

## Traits

### Undead Fortitude
If damage reduces the Dread Commander to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the Dread Commander drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Ashen Loyalty
The Dread Commander cannot be turned or controlled by anyone other than the entity wearing [[The Blackened Crown]].

### Marshal Undead
Undead allies within 60 feet of the Dread Commander have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

### Tactical Brilliance
At the start of each of the Dread Commander's turns, it can choose one of the following tactical advantages for itself and all undead allies within 60 feet until the start of its next turn:
- **Aggressive Advance:** +10 feet to walking speed
- **Defensive Formation:** +2 to AC
- **Focused Assault:** +2 to attack rolls against one creature the Commander designates

### Death's Crown
The Dread Commander wears a crown of blackened iron. While wearing it, the Commander has immunity to the frightened condition and can cast *command* (DC 14) at will. If the crown is removed, the Commander loses Marshal Undead and Tactical Brilliance until it retrieves the crown or gains a new one.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Dread Commander makes three melee attacks.

### Greatsword of the Fallen
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

### Command the Horde (Recharge 5-6)
The Dread Commander issues a tactical command. Up to six undead creatures within 60 feet that can see or hear the Commander can immediately use their reaction to move up to half their speed and make one weapon attack.

### Death's Decree
The Dread Commander points at one creature it can see within 30 feet and utters a word of doom. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) necrotic damage and be frightened until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and isn't frightened.

## Reactions

### Redirect Attack
When a creature the Dread Commander can see targets it with an attack, the Commander can cause another undead within 5 feet of it to become the target instead.

### Tactical Reposition
When an undead ally within 30 feet is reduced to 0 hit points, the Commander can command up to two other undead within 60 feet to move up to half their speed toward the fallen ally's position.

## Legendary Actions
The Dread Commander can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Dread Commander regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Move
The Dread Commander moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Attack (Costs 2 Actions)
The Dread Commander makes one Greatsword of the Fallen attack.

### Command (Costs 1 Action)
One undead creature within 60 feet can use its reaction to move up to its speed or make one weapon attack.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Dread Commanders are undead generals in magnificent but tarnished plate armor bearing high-ranking insignia—the heraldry of house generals, the badges of supreme commanders. Unlike common risen dead, their posture is proud, their movements deliberate and controlled. They wear crowns of blackened iron atop their helms or brows—lesser echoes of [[The Blackened Crown]], granting them authority over the lesser dead. Their eyes burn bright amber, and their voices carry clearly across battlefields. Their wounds are visible but do not weep; their decay is arrested, preserved in the moment of their greatest authority.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Clear, commanding voice; creak of fine armor; footsteps of disciplined march
- **Smell:** Old metal, grave earth, incense of command tents long rotted
- **Temperature effects:** Severe chill; lesser undead nearby seem to stand straighter
- **Magical aura:** Strong necromantic energy focused on the crown

## Behavior

### Temperament
Dread Commanders are coldly intelligent and utterly dedicated to building the army of the dead. They direct operations across [[The Ashen Fields]], coordinating patrols, organizing assaults, and expanding the cursed border. They can negotiate, threaten, and even make temporary alliances if it serves the greater goal—though they will betray any agreement when advantageous.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Sapient (full intelligence)

These are true tacticians who can read battlefields, anticipate enemy strategies, and adapt their forces accordingly. They remember their lives, their names, their skills—and they use all of it in service to [[The Blackened Crown|the Figure at the Heart]].

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Hierarchical command

Dread Commanders form the officer corps of the undead army, each commanding sections of [[The Ashen Fields]]. They answer only to [[The Mad King|the Figure at the Heart]] and compete subtly for favor.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Command positions, strategic locations, the approach to the Heart
- **Climate preferences:** None

### Range
[[The Ashen Fields]], rarely venturing beyond unless leading major operations.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Rise from the graves of high-ranking officers; only 4 are currently known
- **Maturation time:** Immediate
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

## Lore

### Origins
The generals who died at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] were brilliant commanders—men and women who led thousands and changed the course of the war. The curse preserved not just their bodies but their minds, binding them to crowns of blackened iron that link them to [[The Blackened Crown]] itself. They are not puppets; they choose to serve, believing they will be rewarded when the living realm falls.

### History
The first Dread Commander appeared at the Heart of [[The Ashen Fields]] two weeks after [[High King Aldric II]]'s death—General Aleksei Raven of [[House Karath]], who died fighting to the last defending [[The Mad King]]. Three others have since risen. [[The Grey Wardens]] believe more may be buried, waiting.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** Their crowns link them to [[The Blackened Crown]]; destroying the crown weakens the Commander.
2. **True:** They retain full memory of their lives and can be engaged in conversation.
3. **Partially True:** They can be reasoned with—but their loyalty is absolute.

### Known Individuals
1. **General Aleksei Raven** — Former supreme commander of [[House Karath]]'s forces. He guards the northern approach to the Heart.
2. **Marshal Helena Stark** — A Thorne general who died when her own artillery misfired. She now commands the eastern sector.
3. **Lord Commander Varis Crane** — A Valdren nobleman who led the final charge. He oversees the expanding border.
4. **The Silent General** — Name unknown. Commands the Ash Pits. Never speaks.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Dread Commanders avoid direct combat when possible, preferring to direct their troops from protected positions. When engaged, they use Tactical Brilliance to buff their minions, Command the Horde to overwhelm enemies, and Death's Decree to eliminate high-priority targets. They use Redirect Attack to survive longer and Legendary Actions to maintain battlefield control.

### Strengths
- Force multiplier (makes all undead nearby more dangerous)
- High HP (119), AC (18), and saves
- Legendary actions for constant pressure
- Full intelligence allows adaptation
- Death's Crown provides at-will *command*

### Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Losing the crown significantly weakens them
- Rely on having undead allies to maximize effectiveness
- Can be engaged in conversation/distracted

### Group Tactics
A Dread Commander with a complement of [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]], [[Risen Officer|Risen Officers]], and [[Risen Knight|Risen Knights]] is a formidable tactical unit. The Commander stays protected, uses Tactical Brilliance for +2 attack rolls on a designated target, and uses Command the Horde when the party clusters.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
Dread Commanders maintain command posts with:
- Strategic maps of [[The Ashen Fields]] and surrounding regions
- Intelligence reports on living forces
- High-quality weapons and armor
- 3d6 × 100 gp in ancient coins and valuables
- 25% chance of a magic item

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Crown of Blackened Iron | 500 gp | Minor artifact; can control lesser undead |
| Commander's Essence | 100 gp | Powerful necromantic component |
| Strategic Memory | 75 gp | Can be questioned with *speak with dead* for tactical intelligence |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Parlay with the Dead:** A Dread Commander requests a meeting with representatives of the living. It offers a temporary truce in exchange for something it wants. The offer may even be genuine.

2. **The Crown's Weight:** The party recovers a Crown of Blackened Iron from a fallen Commander. It whispers to whoever carries it, offering power over the dead. Destroying it weakens the remaining Commanders.

3. **Assassination:** [[Lord Varic Valdren]] wants a specific Dread Commander killed—Lord Commander Varis Crane, his former rival. The Commander is protected by dozens of risen dead.

4. **Intelligence Gathering:** The party must capture a Dread Commander alive (such as it is) to learn the Figure's plans. They remember everything and can be questioned—if bound.

### Full Creature (Commanding the Horde)
**Prompt:**
A Dread Commander standing in commanding posture atop a rise of ash-covered earth overlooking the endless gray expanse of the Ashen Fields. Medium humanoid undead in magnificent plate armor that was once polished steel but now bears the tarnish of twenty-three years in the grave—still magnificent, still bearing the insignia of a general's rank, but dulled and dark. A crown of blackened iron sits upon a great helm, lesser echo of the Blackened Crown itself, faint dark energy wisping from its edges. The faded heraldry of House Karath is visible on a rotting surcoat, the raven sigil barely recognizable. A massive greatsword is held point-down before the figure, both hands on the crossguard in the posture of command rather than combat. Through the visor's eye slits burn twin points of bright amber fire—not the mindless glow of lesser undead but the calculating intelligence of a true tactician preserved beyond death. Behind the Commander, arranged in perfect formation, stand dozens of Risen Soldiers and Risen Officers awaiting orders, their own amber eyes fixed on their general. The sky above is the permanent gray overcast of the cursed land, ash drifting like snow. The Commander's stance radiates authority, discipline, and patient malevolence—this is no shambling corpse but a thinking enemy who remembers every tactic from life and has eternity to refine them.

### Death's Decree (Action Shot)
**Prompt:**
Close-up of a Dread Commander issuing Death's Decree against a living enemy. The Commander's gauntleted hand is extended, one finger pointing directly at the viewer, as streams of dark necrotic energy spiral outward from the fingertip—purple-black tendrils of death magic seeking their target. The lower face is visible beneath the great helm's visor: gray desiccated flesh stretched over bone, lips pulled back to reveal teeth still intact, mouth open as words of doom echo across the battlefield. The blackened iron crown sits prominent upon the helm's brow, pulsing with the same dark energy that flows from the Commander's hand, connecting crown to power to victim. The eyes behind the visor blaze with bright amber fire, filled with intelligence, malice, and the cold satisfaction of command. The armor shows intricate detail: general's badges of rank, campaign medals fused to the breastplate, the engravings of a career soldier who died at the peak of their authority. In the background, the chaos of battle—living soldiers recoiling, undead advancing, ash swirling in the wind of supernatural command. The atmosphere of a moment before death claims another soul.

### The Four Commanders Council
**Prompt:**
The four known Dread Commanders gathered in a ruined command tent at the Heart of the Ashen Fields, a war council of the dead. Each stands around a decayed map table strewn with tactical tokens and faded charts, their blackened iron crowns marking them as generals of the unliving army. General Aleksei Raven wears House Karath's purple beneath tarnished steel, his presence commanding. Marshal Helena Stark bears scorched armor from the artillery that killed her, her Thorne sigil barely visible. Lord Commander Varis Crane's fine Valdren armor marks him as the nobleman he was, golden dolphins now green with age. The fourth—the Silent General—wears no insignia at all, face hidden entirely behind a closed visor, radiating wrongness even among the dead. Their amber eyes glow as they plan in silence, communicating through the connection of their crowns. Behind them, through the tent's rotted canvas, the army of the dead waits in formation. The atmosphere of ancient enemies now united in death, plotting the fall of the living realm.
