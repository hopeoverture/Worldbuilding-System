# Iron Peak Wyvern

## Overview
Iron Peak Wyverns are winged predators that nest in the high peaks of [[The Ostmark Range]] and [[The Greycrowns]]. Smaller and less intelligent than true dragons, they are nonetheless deadly threats to anyone traveling mountain passes or venturing near their nesting sites. [[House Thorne]] has lost dozens of soldiers to wyvern attacks over the generations, and the creatures are both feared and grudgingly respected in [[The Eastern March]].

## Traits

### Keen Sight
The wyvern has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Flyby
The wyvern doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

### Mountain Hunter
The wyvern has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky, mountainous terrain. It ignores difficult terrain caused by rocks, scree, or steep slopes.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The wyvern makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger. While flying, it can use its claws in place of one other attack.

### Bite
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

### Claws
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the wyvern is flying and the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 14). The wyvern can grapple only one creature at a time.

### Stinger
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Wing Buffet (Recharge 5-6)
The wyvern beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The wyvern can then fly up to half its flying speed.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Iron Peak Wyverns have wingspans of 20-25 feet, with muscular bodies built for mountain hunting. Their scales range from slate gray to iron black, providing excellent camouflage against rocky peaks. Their wings are leathery and their tails end in venomous stingers that can deliver lethal doses of poison. Unlike true dragons, they have only two legs, using their wings as additional limbs when grounded. Their heads are narrow and predatory, with forward-facing eyes for judging distance during dive attacks.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Shrieking cries, beating wings, hissing when threatened
- **Smell:** Reptilian musk, carrion from recent kills
- **Temperature effects:** None
- **Magical aura:** None; these are natural creatures

## Behavior

### Temperament
Iron Peak Wyverns are territorial and aggressive, attacking anything that approaches their nesting sites. Outside their territory, they are opportunistic hunters who prefer easy prey. They are cunning enough to retreat from a fight they're losing, returning with their mate or offspring for revenge.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Animal (cunning predator)

Wyverns are not intelligent, but they are clever hunters. They can recognize dangerous prey and remember individuals who have injured them.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Dive attacks from high altitude, grabbing prey and dropping it
- **Preferred prey:** Mountain goats, deer, lone travelers, pack animals
- **Feeding frequency:** One large meal every 3-4 days
- **Territory size:** 50-100 square miles centered on nesting site

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Pair or Family (mated pair with 1-3 offspring)

Wyverns mate for life and fiercely protect their young. A nesting pair is far more dangerous than a lone wyvern.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Mountain peaks, cliff faces, high passes
- **Climate preferences:** Cold to temperate mountains
- **Shelter requirements:** High ledges or caves for nesting
- **Territory characteristics:** Areas with abundant prey and defensible nesting sites

### Range
[[The Ostmark Range]], [[The Greycrowns]], occasionally ranging to lower elevations to hunt.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** 2-4 eggs per clutch, laid every 2-3 years
- **Offspring care:** Both parents protect and feed young for 2 years
- **Maturation time:** 3 years to adulthood
- **Lifespan:** 50+ years

### Role in Ecosystem
Apex aerial predators who control mountain herbivore populations. Their presence makes high passes dangerous but also keeps prey species from overgrazing alpine meadows.

## Lore

### Origins
Iron Peak Wyverns have inhabited the Ostmark Range since before humans settled [[The Eastern March]]. [[House Thorne]] has fought them for generations, and killing a wyvern is considered a mark of honor among Thorne warriors.

### History
During [[The Great War]], both sides attempted to use wyverns as weapons—with disastrous results. The beasts could not be controlled and attacked friend and foe alike. A Karath attempt to release captured wyverns over [[Stahlburg]] resulted in the wyverns nesting in the city's towers instead, requiring a year-long extermination effort.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** Wyvern venom can be harvested for poison or antidotes.
2. **Partially True:** They hoard treasure. (They collect shiny objects but don't understand value.)
3. **False:** Dragonfire can harm them. (They are resistant to fire.)

### Known Individuals
1. **Ironwing** — A massive old male who has nested at [[Ostmark Pass]] for 40 years. He has killed at least 30 travelers and a dozen Thorne soldiers.
2. **The Widow** — A female whose mate was killed by [[Ser Aldric Thorne]]. She has harassed Thorne patrols ever since.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Wyverns prefer to dive from high altitude, attacking with bite and stinger before using Flyby to escape retaliation. They grab Medium or smaller creatures with their claws and carry them away to drop from height. Against groups, they use Wing Buffet to scatter enemies before focusing on isolated targets.

### Strengths
- Excellent mobility (80 ft. fly speed)
- Flyby prevents opportunity attacks
- Stinger poison deals heavy damage
- Can grapple and drop targets

### Weaknesses
- Poor ground mobility (20 ft.)
- Low Intelligence; relies on instinct
- Grounded wyverns are vulnerable
- Protecting young makes them predictable

### Group Tactics
A mated pair coordinates attacks, with one wyvern drawing attention while the other strikes from behind. They prioritize grabbing and dropping ranged attackers.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
Wyvern nests may contain:
- Shiny objects collected over years (gems, coins, metal items)
- Remains of previous victims (equipment, valuables)
- 2d6 × 50 gp in accumulated treasure
- Wyvern eggs (valuable to collectors: 1,000 gp each)

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Wyvern Venom (1 dose) | 200 gp | Poison (DC 15, 7d6 poison damage) |
| Wyvern Hide | 150 gp | Armor crafting material |
| Stinger | 75 gp | Weapon crafting, alchemical component |
| Wings | 50 gp | Leather goods, decoration |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Pass Patrol:** The party must cross [[Ostmark Pass]], where Ironwing has been attacking travelers. They can fight, sneak, or find another route.

2. **Egg Hunt:** A noble wants a wyvern egg for their menagerie. The party must locate a nest, deal with the parents, and retrieve an egg—all while climbing.

3. **The Widow's Revenge:** After killing a wyvern, the party discovers it was part of a mated pair. The surviving female begins stalking them.

4. **Aerial Escort:** The party must protect a mountain caravan from wyvern attack while traversing exposed terrain with no cover.
