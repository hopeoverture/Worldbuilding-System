# Northland Dire Wolf

## Overview
Northland Dire Wolves are massive predators that roam [[The Northlands]] and the foothills of [[The Greycrowns]]. Larger and more intelligent than common wolves, these beasts have been part of northern life since before recorded history. [[The Spirit-Speakers]] consider them sacred animals—manifestations of ancestor spirits in animal form. Whether divine or merely ancient, they are apex predators who have claimed the frozen forests as their eternal domain.

## Traits

### Keen Hearing and Smell
The dire wolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

### Pack Tactics
The dire wolf has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Cold Endurance
The dire wolf has advantage on Constitution saving throws against extreme cold and doesn't suffer the effects of frigid environments.

### Snow Camouflage
The dire wolf has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.

## Actions

### Bite
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Howl (Recharge 5-6)
The dire wolf lets out a terrifying howl. Each creature within 300 feet that can hear the howl and isn't a wolf must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the wolf's next turn. Additionally, any wolves within 1 mile can hear the howl and know the direction of its source.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Northland Dire Wolves stand nearly 4 feet tall at the shoulder and can exceed 8 feet in length. Their fur is thick and primarily gray-white, providing excellent camouflage in snowy environments, though some packs display darker coats suited to forest hunting. Their eyes are typically pale—silver, ice-blue, or amber—and shine with an intelligence that unnerves those who meet their gaze. Their paws are broad and furred between the toes, allowing them to run atop snow without sinking.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Deep growling, haunting howls that echo for miles
- **Smell:** Musky wolf scent, blood from recent kills
- **Temperature effects:** None; they are adapted to cold
- **Magical aura:** Faint; [[The Spirit-Speakers]] claim to sense ancestral energy

## Behavior

### Temperament
Northland Dire Wolves are intelligent, cautious predators. They assess threats before engaging and prefer to hunt in packs using coordinated tactics. Unlike common wolves, they do not flee from humans automatically—they determine whether the humans are prey, threats, or irrelevant. Those who show respect or carry the blessings of [[The Spirit-Speakers]] may pass unmolested.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Animal (high animal cunning)

These wolves demonstrate problem-solving abilities, long-term memory, and what appears to be ritualistic behavior around kills. Some scholars believe they possess near-sapient intelligence.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Pack ambushes, pursuit over long distances, driving prey toward natural obstacles
- **Preferred prey:** Elk, deer, mountain goats; will target isolated humanoids
- **Feeding frequency:** Every 3-5 days for a large kill
- **Territory size:** 100-300 square miles per pack

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Pack (8-15 members)

Packs are led by a mated alpha pair and include their offspring from multiple years. Pack hierarchy is strict but not brutal—members rarely fight seriously.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Ancient forests of [[Myrkvid]], [[Greycrown Gap|Greycrown]] foothills, frozen tundra
- **Climate preferences:** Cold to frigid
- **Shelter requirements:** Den sites in caves, under fallen trees, or dug into hillsides
- **Territory characteristics:** Areas with abundant prey and defensible denning sites

### Range
[[The Northlands]], [[Greycrowns|Greycrown Mountains]], occasionally south to [[The Crown Lands]] in harsh winters.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Mated pair produces 4-6 pups annually
- **Offspring care:** Entire pack participates in raising young
- **Maturation time:** 2 years to adulthood
- **Lifespan:** 15-20 years; alphas often longer

### Role in Ecosystem
Apex predators who control prey populations and provide carrion for scavengers. Their presence indicates a healthy forest ecosystem.

## Lore

### Origins
[[The Spirit-Speakers]] teach that the Northland Dire Wolves were once human warriors who chose to remain in the world as guardians rather than pass to the afterlife. Whether true or legend, these wolves have been part of northern culture since the Age of Clans.

### History
During [[The Great War]], a pack of dire wolves allegedly attacked a Karath supply column passing through the northern forests, destroying vital provisions. The column's commander claimed the wolves were directed by [[The Spirit-Speakers]], though this was never proven.

### Myths & Legends
1. **Partially True:** They are spirits of ancestors. ([[The Spirit-Speakers]] believe this; the wolves show unusual behavior around their rituals.)
2. **True:** A lone traveler who shows respect may pass through their territory unharmed.
3. **False:** Silver weapons deal extra damage to them. (They are natural animals, not supernatural.)

### Known Individuals
1. **Graymaul** — A legendary alpha whose pack controls the eastern [[Myrkvid]]. Said to be over 30 years old.
2. **The White Shadow** — A lone wolf of unusual size that has been sighted near [[Vindrheim]]. Locals consider it an omen.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Dire wolf packs coordinate attacks, with some members driving prey toward an ambush while others wait in hiding. They target the weakest member of a group first. They use Howl to frighten prey and summon pack members, then use Pack Tactics to gain advantage on prone or isolated targets.

### Strengths
- High speed (50 ft.)
- Pack Tactics provides consistent advantage
- Bite can knock targets prone
- Excellent senses; hard to surprise

### Weaknesses
- Low Intelligence; can be outwitted
- Fire causes them to hesitate
- Killing the alpha may scatter the pack
- Will retreat if taking significant losses

### Group Tactics
A typical hunting pack (6-8 wolves) divides into drivers and ambushers. The drivers chase prey toward where the ambushers wait, hidden in snow or undergrowth. They focus attacks on one target until it falls.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
Wolf dens may contain:
- Remains of previous victims (coins, equipment)
- Bones of prey animals
- Occasionally valuable items from travelers

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Dire Wolf Pelt | 50 gp | Warm clothing, decoration |
| Fangs | 10 gp | Jewelry, trophy, alchemical use |
| Heart | 25 gp | [[The Spirit-Speakers]] ritual component |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **The Hunt:** The party realizes they're being stalked by a pack. They must reach shelter, stand and fight, or find a way to convince the wolves they're not worth hunting.

2. **Sacred Ground:** The party needs to pass through territory protected by a pack. [[The Spirit-Speakers]] can provide a charm that grants safe passage—for a price.

3. **Wounded Alpha:** The party finds a dire wolf caught in a poacher's trap. Freeing it earns the pack's tolerance; killing it earns their eternal enmity.

4. **Winter's Children:** During a harsh winter, a pack has begun hunting travelers on [[The Northern Way]]. [[Vindrheim]] offers a bounty, but [[The Spirit-Speakers]] warn against killing the "ancestors."
