# Risen Archer

## Overview
Risen Archers are the reanimated remains of bowmen who fell during [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. Unlike their infantry counterparts, these undead retain uncanny accuracy with their corroded bows, picking off targets from elevated positions or the rear of undead formations. Their dexterity in death exceeds their strength, making them dangerous support for [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldier]] squads.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Risen Archers appear more gaunt than their infantry counterparts, their lighter armor having provided less protection from the elements. They wear rotted leather armor over gray, desiccated flesh, with empty quivers at their hips perpetually refilling with arrows of solidified ash. Their fingers are skeletal and precise, their draw arm permanently bent in a firing position. Their eyes glow with the same amber light as all Ashen Fields undead, but seem to track movement with disturbing accuracy.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Creak of bowstring, whistle of arrows, dry clicking of bones
- **Smell:** Old leather, grave mold, ash
- **Temperature effects:** Unnatural chill
- **Magical aura:** Faint necromantic energy

## Behavior

### Temperament
Risen Archers position themselves at range and fire relentlessly until their targets are dead or they are engaged in melee. They prefer elevated positions—ruined walls, dead trees, burial mounds—and will relocate if their sight lines are blocked. Unlike [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]], they do not seek melee combat.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Cunning (tactical positioning)

Risen Archers demonstrate an understanding of cover, elevation, and sight lines. They instinctively seek advantageous positions and coordinate volleys with other archers when present.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Stationary sniping from elevated positions
- **Preferred prey:** Anyone who enters their range
- **Feeding frequency:** Do not feed
- **Territory size:** Effective range around their position

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Pack (archer line)

Risen Archers form firing lines of 3-6, often positioned behind [[Risen Soldier]] squads. They defer to [[Risen Officer|Risen Officers]] for positioning commands.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Battlefields with elevation, ruined structures, dead forests
- **Climate preferences:** The perpetual chill of [[The Ashen Fields]]
- **Shelter requirements:** None
- **Territory characteristics:** Any position with sight lines

### Range
[[The Ashen Fields]] and slowly expanding cursed border.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Rise from mass graves or fall on cursed ground
- **Maturation time:** 1d4 days after death on cursed ground
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

### Role in Ecosystem
Ranged support for the growing army of the dead.

## Lore

### Origins
The bowmen of [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] were positioned on the flanks and rear, raining death on enemy formations. When the curse took hold, they rose with their skills intact, now firing arrows that materialize from the ash itself.

### History
Risen Archers were among the first undead noticed by [[Chernogrod]] patrols—their arrows struck scouts from impossible distances before the source could be identified.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** Their arrows reform from ash; destroying the bow doesn't stop them.
2. **False:** They can be avoided by staying low to the ground.
3. **True:** They cannot see through sanctified barriers or holy symbols.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Risen Archers open combat from maximum range, targeting spellcasters and unarmored opponents first. They continue firing even as melee engages around them, using Dead-Eye to attack enemies within reach. They retreat only when specifically commanded.

### Strengths
- Superior accuracy (+4 to hit)
- No disadvantage in close range
- Difficult to pin down

### Weaknesses
- Lower HP than infantry
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Poor in extended melee

### Group Tactics
Firing lines concentrate volleys on single targets. When supporting [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]], they target enemies engaged in melee with allies, using Dead-Eye to avoid retreat.

## Treasure

### Body Parts

## Encounter Ideas

2. **The Archer's Rest:** A ruined watchtower contains 6 Risen Archers who fire on anyone approaching [[The Ashen Fields]] from the north.

3. **Covering Fire:** While fighting [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]], the party realizes Risen Archers are positioned on the flanks, creating a deadly crossfire.
