# Risen Knight

## Overview
Risen Knights are the reanimated remains of noble warriors and heavy cavalry who fell during [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. Clad in full plate armor that has resisted decay, these undead retain much of their martial prowess and fight with terrifying skill. They serve as elite troops in the army of the dead—shock troops that can break defensive lines and cut down multiple foes before being stopped. Some still call for their warhorses, which rise to answer.

## Traits

### Undead Fortitude
If damage reduces the Risen Knight to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the Risen Knight drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Martial Memory
The Risen Knight retains significant combat training from life. It can take the Dodge, Disengage, or Dash action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

### Ashen Loyalty
The Risen Knight cannot be turned or controlled by anyone other than the entity wearing [[The Blackened Crown]].

### Dread Presence
Any creature hostile to the Risen Knight that starts its turn within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this Risen Knight's Dread Presence for 24 hours.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Risen Knight makes two melee attacks.

### Greatsword
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.

### Lance (Mounted Only)
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. If the Risen Knight moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target before the attack, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Bonus Actions

### Summon Steed (1/Day)
The Risen Knight calls for its warhorse. If the horse died at [[The Ashen Fields]], it rises as a skeletal warhorse (use **Warhorse Skeleton** stat block) in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The steed acts on the Knight's initiative and obeys its commands.

## Reactions

### Parry
The Risen Knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the Knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Risen Knights are encased in full plate armor—once magnificent, now tarnished and scarred with the marks of the battle that killed them. House heraldry is still visible on surcoats and shields: the thorns of [[House Thorne]], the dolphins of [[House Valdren]], or the ravens of [[House Karath]]. The armor is fused to the corpse beneath, making removal impossible. Through visors and gaps in the plate, gray desiccated flesh and glowing amber eyes are visible. Many bear the wounds that killed them—gaps where blades pierced, dents where maces crushed.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Heavy footfalls, scrape of plate armor, hollow battle cries
- **Smell:** Old metal, rust, grave earth
- **Temperature effects:** Severe chill; breath frosts within 10 feet
- **Magical aura:** Moderate to strong necromantic energy

## Behavior

### Temperament
Risen Knights are aggressive and direct. They charge into combat, seeking worthy opponents—other armored warriors, obvious leaders, spellcasters. They fight with the discipline of trained knights, using their mobility to avoid being surrounded while dealing maximum damage. They do not flee but may withdraw to protect more important undead.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Cunning (tactical combat awareness)

Risen Knights remember their martial training and apply it effectively. They recognize advantageous terrain, exploit openings, and can coordinate with other Knights in devastating cavalry charges.

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Solitary or Pair (household knights)

Risen Knights are rare enough that they typically operate independently or in pairs. Groups of 3 or more suggest a coordinated assault by [[Dread Commander|Dread Commanders]].

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Battlefields, noble burial sites, cursed lands
- **Climate preferences:** The chill of [[The Ashen Fields]]

### Range
[[The Ashen Fields]] and the expanding cursed border.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Rise from knightly graves or from armored warriors who fall on cursed ground
- **Maturation time:** 1d4 days; Knights retain more of their skills than common soldiers
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

## Lore

### Origins
The knights who fell at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] died in glory—and horror. Many were cut down in the final charge against [[The Mad King]], their oaths unfulfilled, their houses unavenged. The curse preserved their armor, their skills, and their eternal duty to fight.

### History
The first Risen Knight was spotted three weeks after the initial rising—[[Ser Aldric Crane of the Valdren Guard]], charging endlessly across the fields where he fell defending his lord. Others have since risen. [[The Grey Wardens]] count at least twelve known Risen Knights, with more likely still buried.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** A Risen Knight's armor cannot be removed; it has fused with the corpse.
2. **True:** They can call their warhorses from death.
3. **False:** They can be reasoned with by invoking their old oaths. (They remember nothing but battle.)

### Known Individuals
1. **Ser Aldric Crane** — A Valdren knight who died in the final charge. He still rides his skeletal warhorse, endlessly charging enemy positions that no longer exist.
2. **Dame Ilsa Thorne** — A Thorne champion who died killing three Karath knights. She rises with their three swords still embedded in her armor.
3. **Ser Mikhail Raven** — A Karath loyalist who died defending [[The Mad King]]. He guards the approach to the Heart.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Risen Knights open with a mounted charge if their steed is available, using the lance attack to knock targets prone before following up with greatsword strikes. On foot, they use Martial Memory to maintain mobility, targeting the most dangerous opponents first. Dread Presence keeps weaker foes at bay.

### Strengths
- High AC (18) and HP (68)
- Resistance to nonmagical physical damage
- Multiattack with bonus necrotic damage
- Excellent mobility (bonus action Dash/Disengage/Dodge)
- Can summon a mount

### Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Relies on martial combat (no spells or ranged options)
- Slow when unmounted and not using Dash
- Dread Presence DC is moderate (12)

### Group Tactics
Multiple Risen Knights perform devastating cavalry charges, using lances to knock targets prone for other Knights to attack with advantage. They focus fire on the greatest threat, then move to the next.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
Risen Knights don't maintain lairs, but their bodies carry:
- Masterwork plate armor (damaged but repairable: 1,000 gp value)
- Masterwork weapons (damaged but repairable: 200-500 gp value)
- Noble signet rings and house tokens (50-200 gp value)
- Personal effects (letters, portraits, holy symbols)

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Knight's Essence | 50 gp | High-grade necromantic component |
| House Signet | 50-200 gp | Historical artifact, identification |
| Armor Fragments | 25 gp | Material for undead-bane weapons |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **The Charge:** A Risen Knight on its skeletal steed charges the party across an open field. They have 6 rounds before impact.

2. **Honor Duel:** A Risen Knight blocks the party's path and challenges the most heavily armored character to single combat in a hollow, echoing voice.

3. **The Guard:** Two Risen Knights guard a mass grave containing something valuable. They do not attack unless approached within 30 feet.

4. **Fallen Champion:** A mortally wounded [[House Thorne]] scout begs the party to recover his grandmother's body—Dame Ilsa Thorne—from [[The Ashen Fields]]. She has risen.
