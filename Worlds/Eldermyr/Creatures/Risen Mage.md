# Risen Mage

## Overview
Risen Mages are the reanimated remains of war wizards and battle sorcerers who fell during [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. Unlike other risen dead, these undead retained their connection to the arcane—twisted now by the curse into something darker. They cast corrupted versions of the spells they knew in life, their magic tainted with necrotic energy. Rare but devastating, a single Risen Mage can turn the tide of an encounter.

## Traits

### Undead Fortitude
If damage reduces the Risen Mage to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the Risen Mage drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Ashen Loyalty
The Risen Mage cannot be turned or controlled by anyone other than the entity wearing [[The Blackened Crown]].

### Corrupted Spellcasting
The Risen Mage is a 4th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). All damaging spells deal necrotic damage instead of their normal damage type. It has the following wizard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will):** *chill touch*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*

**1st level (4 slots):** *magic missile* (necrotic), *shield*, *ray of sickness*

**2nd level (3 slots):** *blindness/deafness*, *misty step*, *scorching ray* (necrotic)

### Death Burst
When the Risen Mage dies, it releases a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## Actions

### Staff Strike
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2 (1d6 - 1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.

### Chill Touch (Cantrip)
*Ranged Spell Attack:* +4 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 5 (1d8) necrotic damage, and the target can't regain hit points until the start of the Risen Mage's next turn. If the target is undead, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against the Risen Mage until the end of the mage's next turn.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Risen Mages appear as skeletal figures in tattered robes that still bear traces of their former allegiance—[[The Arcane Academy|Academy]] blue, [[House Valdren|Valdren]] gold, or [[House Karath|Karath]] black. Their flesh has withered more completely than other risen dead, leaving gaunt, almost skeletal faces with burning amber eyes that pulse brighter when casting. Their hands crackle with residual magical energy, leaving trails of dark sparks. Many still clutch staffs or wands, fused to their grip.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Whispered incantations, crackling energy, hollow laughter
- **Smell:** Ozone, old parchment, decay
- **Temperature effects:** Fluctuating chill with warmth near hands
- **Magical aura:** Strong necromantic energy, detectable at 30 feet

## Behavior

### Temperament
Risen Mages are cunning and tactical. They position themselves behind [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]] or [[Risen Knight|Risen Knights]], using their spells to devastating effect. They prioritize enemy spellcasters and healers, recognizing the threat. Unlike other risen dead, they show something like personality—occasional laughter, muttered spell components, gestures that suggest remembered habits.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Sapient (limited)

Risen Mages retain significant intelligence and magical knowledge. They can strategize, recognize tactical opportunities, and adapt to changing circumstances. However, their memories are fragmented, and they cannot learn new spells or develop new tactics.

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Solitary (attached to units as support)

Risen Mages are rare—perhaps 1 in 50 risen dead. They typically support larger units of infantry, providing magical firepower and control.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Magical anomaly sites, command positions, rear of formations
- **Climate preferences:** The cursed chill of [[The Ashen Fields]]

### Range
[[The Ashen Fields]] and expanding border.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Rise from mage graves or from spellcasters who fall on cursed ground
- **Maturation time:** 1d6 days; magical connection must reform
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

## Lore

### Origins
The war wizards of [[The Great War]] fought on both sides—[[The Arcane Academy|Arcane Academy]] graduates serving [[House Thorne]] and [[House Valdren]], while [[House Karath]] employed its own blood mages and the forbidden practitioners who served [[The Mad King]]. The curse preserved their magical abilities but corrupted them, converting all their power to the necrotic energy that suffuses [[The Ashen Fields]].

### History
The first Risen Mage appeared two months after the initial rising—a former Academy graduate who began casting *scorching ray* at living scouts, the flames turned to beams of pure darkness. [[Archmagister Corwin Ashford]] has declared the existence of Risen Mages a crisis requiring Academy intervention.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** Their spells deal necrotic damage regardless of original type.
2. **True:** They explode with necrotic energy when killed.
3. **False:** They can be reasoned with by speaking arcane phrases. (They cannot truly think.)

### Known Individuals
1. **Magister Aldric Vorn** — A former Academy instructor who died defending Valdren lines. He still lectures in fragments while casting, critiquing his own technique.
2. **The Ash Witch** — A Karath blood mage whose identity is unknown. She appears as a burned figure wreathed in dark flame.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Risen Mages open combat with *scorching ray* (necrotic) against the most dangerous target, then use *magic missile* (necrotic) on wounded enemies or those with high AC. They use *misty step* to escape melee, *shield* to survive attacks, and *blindness/deafness* to neutralize threats. They save spell slots for high-value targets.

### Strengths
- Ranged magical damage at multiple ranges
- Versatile spell selection
- Death Burst punishes melee attackers
- Higher Intelligence than other risen dead

### Weaknesses
- Low HP (39) and AC (12)
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Poor melee capability
- Limited spell slots

### Group Tactics
Behind a screen of [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]], the Mage targets enemy spellcasters and healers. If multiple Mages are present, they coordinate *scorching ray* volleys on priority targets.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
Risen Mages may carry:
- Spellbook fragments (damaged but valuable: 50-200 gp)
- Spell components (10-50 gp value)
- Academy credentials or house insignia
- Wand or staff (possibly magical)

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Corrupted Spell Essence | 30 gp | Necromantic spell component |
| Mage's Eye | 25 gp | Scrying component |
| Death Spark | 20 gp | Component for necrotic spells |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Academic Interest:** [[The Arcane Academy]] wants a Risen Mage's spellbook recovered—specifically, the notes of Magister Aldric Vorn, who was developing new battle magic when he fell.

2. **Artillery Support:** While fighting [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]], the party realizes they're under magical bombardment from a Risen Mage hidden in a ruined tower 120 feet away.

3. **The Debate:** Two Risen Mages from opposite sides of [[The Great War]] are locked in an eternal arcane duel, their spells striking each other repeatedly in the same pattern. Breaking the cycle might free something—or unleash it.

4. **Death Burst Chain:** The party discovers three Risen Mages positioned 15 feet apart. Killing one triggers Death Burst, which might kill the others, creating a chain reaction.
