# Risen Officer

## Overview
Risen Officers are the reanimated remains of military commanders who fell during [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. These undead retain fragments of tactical memory and can command [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]] with surprising effectiveness. Wearing better armor than common infantry and wielding finer weapons, they serve as lieutenants in the growing army of the dead, coordinating patrols and directing assaults on the living.

## Traits

### Undead Fortitude
If damage reduces the Risen Officer to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the Risen Officer drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Command the Dead
As a bonus action, the Risen Officer can command up to 3 [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]] or [[Risen Archer|Risen Archers]] within 30 feet that can see or hear it. The commanded undead can immediately use their reaction to move up to half their speed or make one weapon attack.

### Ashen Loyalty
The Risen Officer cannot be turned or controlled by anyone other than the entity wearing [[The Blackened Crown]].

### Rally the Fallen
When the Risen Officer is reduced to 0 hit points, each [[Risen Soldier]] or [[Risen Archer]] within 30 feet gains advantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn as they surge forward to avenge their commander.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Risen Officer makes two melee attacks.

### Longsword
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage if used with two hands.

### Command Strike
The Risen Officer targets one [[Risen Soldier]] or [[Risen Archer]] within 30 feet. That creature can use its reaction to make a weapon attack with advantage.

## Reactions

### Tactical Withdrawal
When a creature the Risen Officer can see targets it with an attack, the Officer can command one [[Risen Soldier]] within 5 feet to use its reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Risen Officers wear better-preserved armor than common soldiers—breastplates bearing house insignia, cloaks that still show traces of regimental colors, and shields with heraldic devices. Their flesh is the same gray desiccation as other risen dead, but their posture remains commanding. Many still wear the symbols of their rank: captain's gorgets, lieutenant's sashes, or sergeant's badges. Their eyes burn brighter amber than the rank and file.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Rasping commands in dead languages, clank of armor
- **Smell:** Old metal polish, grave dust, decay
- **Temperature effects:** Pronounced chill; nearby temperature drops noticeably
- **Magical aura:** Moderate necromantic energy

## Behavior

### Temperament
Risen Officers direct rather than charge. They position themselves in the center or rear of their squads, issuing commands and coordinating attacks. When forced into melee, they fight efficiently but always seek to return to a command position. They show more tactical awareness than common undead.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Cunning (limited sapience)

These undead retain fragments of military training and tactical knowledge. They can recognize advantageous positions, identify high-value targets, and coordinate their troops. However, their strategies are limited to variations on tactics they knew in life.

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Pack (command hierarchy)

Risen Officers command squads of 4-8 [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]] and/or [[Risen Archer|Risen Archers]]. Multiple Officers defer to [[Dread Commander|Dread Commanders]] when present. Without higher command, Officers compete for territory.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Command positions, elevated ground, center of formations
- **Climate preferences:** The cursed chill of [[The Ashen Fields]]

### Range
[[The Ashen Fields]] and expanding border.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Rise from officer graves or from those who held command who fall on cursed ground
- **Maturation time:** 1d4 days after death; officers sometimes retain rank memories from life
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

## Lore

### Origins
The officers who fell at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] died giving orders. Their last thoughts were of duty, command, and the soldiers depending on them. The curse preserved those final moments, binding them to eternal command of troops who cannot disobey.

### History
[[The Grey Wardens]] first identified Risen Officers when patrol patterns changed from random wandering to organized sweeps. The undead were learning, or rather, remembering.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** A Risen Officer can speak, unlike common risen dead.
2. **True:** They remember fragments of their former identity—names, ranks, final orders.
3. **False:** Killing an Officer disperses its squad. (They fight on without direction.)

### Known Individuals
1. **Captain Mira Volkov** — A Karath loyalist who died defending the command tent. She still issues orders in Old Karath, directing troops against "the Thorne betrayers."
2. **Lieutenant Aldwin Crane** — A Valdren officer who died in the final charge. He leads a mixed squad of former enemies, as if the old allegiances no longer matter.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Risen Officers open combat by positioning their squads using Command the Dead, then engage priority targets with Multiattack while continuing to direct troops. They use Tactical Withdrawal to keep themselves alive and Command Strike to maximize damage output.

### Strengths
- Force multiplier for other undead
- Higher HP and AC than common risen
- Can speak and potentially negotiate (though rarely)
- Rally the Fallen makes killing them dangerous

### Weaknesses
- Dependent on having troops to command
- Slower than living commanders
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Limited tactical repertoire

### Group Tactics
An Officer with a squad of 6 soldiers creates a dangerous force: the Officer directs 3 soldiers to flank while 3 engage frontally, using Command the Dead to generate extra attacks.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
- Officer's personal effects (rings, medals, letters)
- Higher-quality weapons and armor
- Command documents and maps (historical value)
- 2d10 gp equivalent in coins and valuables

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Officer's Badge | 10-25 gp | Historical artifact, identification |
| Command Essence | 20 gp | Necromantic component for commanding undead |
| Soul Fragment | 30 gp | Contains memories; can be questioned with magic |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Chain of Command:** The party encounters a Risen Officer commanding 6 [[Risen Soldier|Risen Soldiers]]. The Officer speaks, demanding to know their allegiance in a war that ended 23 years ago.

2. **The Last Orders:** A Risen Officer patrols the same route endlessly, following orders given by a commander long since crumbled to dust. Breaking the patrol pattern might reveal what it's guarding.

3. **Enemy of My Enemy:** Two Risen Officers from opposing sides of [[The Great War]] are engaged in an eternal skirmish. The party must navigate between them—or use their conflict as cover.

4. **Intelligence Gathering:** [[The Grey Wardens]] want a Risen Officer captured intact. The fragments of memory it carries might reveal what's happening at the Heart of [[The Ashen Fields]].
