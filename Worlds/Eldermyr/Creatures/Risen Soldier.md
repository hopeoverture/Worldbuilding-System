# Risen Soldier

## Overview
Risen Soldiers are the most common undead found in [[The Ashen Fields]]—the reanimated corpses of infantry who fell during [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] twenty-three years ago. They emerge from mass graves still wearing rusted armor and clutching corroded weapons, their wounds still fresh despite decades of burial. Though individually weak, they fight with unsettling coordination, responding to commands from [[The Blackened Crown|the Figure at the Heart]].

## Traits

### Undead Fortitude
If damage reduces the Risen Soldier to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the Risen Soldier drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Pack Tactics
The Risen Soldier has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the soldier's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Ashen Loyalty
The Risen Soldier cannot be turned or controlled by anyone other than the entity wearing [[The Blackened Crown]]. Attempts to use *Turn Undead* or similar abilities cause the soldier to become hostile to the source rather than fleeing.

### Corroded Javelin
*Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Risen Soldiers appear as corpses in varying states of decay, yet their wounds remain bizarrely fresh—as if they died yesterday rather than twenty-three years ago. They wear the rusted remnants of chainmail armor, often bearing the heraldry of whichever side they fought for in [[The Great War]]: Valdren dolphins, Thorne thorns, or Karath ravens. Their flesh is gray and desiccated, their eyes sunken pits that glow with faint amber light. Many still bear the wounds that killed them—sword gashes, arrow wounds, burns from magical fire.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Low groaning, the scrape of rusted metal, clicking of teeth
- **Smell:** Grave dirt, old blood, cold ash
- **Temperature effects:** Unnatural chill within 10 feet
- **Magical aura:** Faint necromantic energy detectable with *Detect Magic*

## Behavior

### Temperament
Risen Soldiers are relentless but not mindless. They patrol the Ashen Fields in formations, respond to tactical commands from an unseen source, and prioritize threats methodically. They show no fear, no mercy, and no hesitation. When engaging enemies, they attempt to flank and surround, using pack tactics instinctively.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Cunning (tactical awareness without true sapience)

The Risen Soldiers retain muscle memory from their military training. They can execute basic formations, use terrain for advantage, and coordinate attacks. However, they cannot speak, adapt to unexpected situations, or exercise independent judgment beyond immediate combat.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Patrol in squads, respond to disturbances, pursue intruders
- **Preferred prey:** The living, particularly those wearing enemy heraldry from [[The Great War]]
- **Feeding frequency:** Do not feed; sustained by [[The Blackened Crown]]'s power
- **Territory size:** The Ashen Fields and slowly expanding border

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Pack (military squad)

Risen Soldiers operate in squads of 4-8, with larger groups forming patrols of 20-30. They defer to [[Risen Officer|Risen Officers]] when present and can be coordinated into formations by [[Dread Commander|Dread Commanders]].

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Blighted battlefields, mass graves, cursed earth
- **Climate preferences:** The perpetual gray chill of [[The Ashen Fields]]
- **Shelter requirements:** None; often remain partially buried until disturbed
- **Territory characteristics:** Cursed ground where the veil between life and death is thin

### Range
Currently confined to [[The Ashen Fields]] and immediate surroundings. The boundary expands approximately one mile per year. Risen Soldiers cannot venture far from cursed ground without weakening.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** New soldiers rise from mass graves or from those killed within the cursed zone
- **Offspring care:** N/A
- **Maturation time:** Rise within 1d4 days of death on cursed ground
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

### Role in Ecosystem
Risen Soldiers are a symptom of the curse, not a natural part of any ecosystem. Their presence kills vegetation, poisons water, and drives away natural wildlife. They serve as foot soldiers in the army of the dead that [[The Blackened Crown|the Figure at the Heart]] is assembling.

## Lore

### Origins
The Risen Soldiers are victims of [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], where 10,000 soldiers died in a single day. The Chronicler's covenant—that all souls shall find rest—was broken when [[The Mad King]] activated [[The Blackened Crown]]. The dead could not pass on. Now, twenty-three years later, they rise with their wounds still fresh, still fighting the battle that killed them.

### History
For two decades, the mass graves of [[The Ashen Fields]] remained still. Three months ago, coinciding with the death of [[High King Aldric II]], the dead began stirring. Patrols from [[Chernogrod]] reported movement. Then organized marching. Then attacks on the living. The rising dead now number in the hundreds, with more clawing their way free each night.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** The Risen Soldiers can be identified by their heraldry—Valdren soldiers still attack Karath soldiers, and vice versa, even in death.
2. **True:** Holy water burns them, and they cannot cross sanctified ground.
3. **False:** Burning the bodies prevents them from rising. (The curse reanimates them regardless.)

### Known Individuals
1. **The Eternal Standard-Bearer** — A Risen Soldier who still carries the torn banner of House Karath's loyalist forces, leading squads as if in perpetual charge.
2. **The Weeping Soldier** — An anomaly who cries tears of ash and occasionally speaks fragments of a prayer to the Chronicler before attacking.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Risen Soldiers engage with simple but effective tactics. They close distance in tight formation, attempting to surround isolated targets. Once in melee, they use Pack Tactics to gain advantage, focusing attacks on a single enemy until it falls. They retreat only when commanded by a superior undead and never flee from fear.

### Strengths
- Numbers (rarely encountered alone)
- Pack Tactics provides consistent advantage
- Undead Fortitude makes them difficult to put down
- Cannot be turned or controlled

### Weaknesses
- Slow movement speed (20 ft.)
- Low Intelligence prevents adaptation
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Radiant damage and critical hits bypass Undead Fortitude

### Group Tactics
Squads of 4-8 attempt flanking maneuvers. Groups of 8+ form shield walls with front ranks engaging while rear ranks throw javelins. When a [[Risen Officer]] is present, coordination improves dramatically.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
Mass graves may contain:
- Rusted weapons and armor (worthless unless restored)
- Personal effects of the fallen (rings, lockets, coins)
- Occasional intact weapon or piece of armor (1 in 20 chance)
- Historical documents or insignia (valuable to historians)

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Grave Dust | 5 gp | Necromantic spell component |
| Death's Essence | 10 gp | Crafting material for undead-bane weapons |
| Soldier's Badge | 1-10 gp | Historical identification, proof of death |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Patrol Ambush:** While crossing the edge of [[The Ashen Fields]], the party is spotted by a patrol of 6 Risen Soldiers who move to surround them.

2. **The Lost Patrol:** The party discovers a squad of Risen Soldiers attacking a group of refugees fleeing [[The Karath Reach]]. The soldiers wear Valdren heraldry—ancestors of [[Lord Varic Valdren]]'s allies.

3. **Recovery Mission:** [[The Grey Wardens]] hire the party to recover the personal effects of a fallen knight from [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. The knight has risen, and finding his grave means facing a small army.

4. **Strange Mercy:** A lone Risen Soldier stands at a crossroads, not attacking but pointing toward [[Chernogrod]]. Is it warning travelers away, or directing them into a trap?

### Full Creature (Patrol Formation)
**Prompt:**
A Risen Soldier standing at attention on the ash-covered battlefield of the Ashen Fields, one of the countless dead who fell twenty-three years ago and now march again. Medium humanoid undead in rusted chainmail armor that was once polished steel, now corroded and dark but still clinging to the corpse that wears it. The flesh beneath is gray and desiccated, dried like leather stretched over bone, yet bizarrely preserved—the wounds that killed this soldier still appear fresh, a massive sword wound across the torso still glistening with blood that should have dried decades ago. The eyes are sunken deep into the skull, their sockets containing points of faint amber light that gleam with a cunning that shouldn't exist in mindless undead. In one hand, a notched and rusted longsword is gripped with surprising firmness; in the other, a dented shield bearing the faded purple raven of House Karath. The military tabard that once identified this soldier's unit hangs in tatters, the heraldry barely visible. Grave dirt still clings to the armor's joints and the creases of dried skin, ash coating everything in gray. The posture is unnervingly correct—this corpse remembers how to stand at attention. Behind the soldier, others stand in formation, dozens of the risen dead awaiting orders from their sergeant who still calls commands in a voice like grinding stone. The atmosphere of military discipline perverted by undeath, of soldiers who cannot stop fighting a war that ended long ago.

### Rising From the Grave
**Prompt:**
Close-up of a Risen Soldier emerging from a mass grave in the Ashen Fields, the horrifying moment of undead animation captured in detail. The gray earth cracks and heaves as the corpse claws its way upward, one arm already free and reaching toward the sky, skeletal fingers grasping at nothing. The face is emerging from the soil—gray desiccated skin stretched taut over skull-like features, mouth open in a silent groan that reveals blackened teeth still stained with old blood, the expression frozen between agony and hunger. The eyes blaze with faint amber light, suddenly alive with awareness that shouldn't exist, locked onto the viewer with predatory focus. A rusted chainmail coif frames the face, links corroded together but still intact, caked with grave soil and the roots of dead plants. Around the emerging figure, the ground is disturbed in a circle—other hands reaching up, other faces pressing against the underside of the earth, dozens more preparing to rise. Ash particles drift in the gray air, catching what little light filters through the perpetual overcast. The wound that killed this soldier—an arrow still embedded in the throat—is visible as the chest emerges, the injury as fresh as if inflicted moments ago. The atmosphere of horror awakening, of death refusing to remain permanent, of a covenant broken and the dead returning to a world that should have forgotten them.

### The Eternal Standard-Bearer
**Prompt:**
The Eternal Standard-Bearer—a unique Risen Soldier who still carries the torn battle standard of House Karath's loyalist forces—leading a patrol across the Ashen Fields. This undead is distinctive among its mindless brethren: it marches at the head of a formation of a dozen Risen Soldiers, holding aloft a banner pole topped with the rotting remains of a purple flag bearing the black raven of Karath. The standard is torn, stained with blood both old and new, but the Standard-Bearer has not released it in twenty-three years of death. Its armor is more elaborate than common soldiers—a junior officer, perhaps, who died defending the colors. The face beneath a rusted helm shows the same preservation as all the risen dead: gray skin, amber eyes, wounds that will not close. But there is something almost purposeful in its gait, something that speaks to the military discipline that refuses to die even when the soldier has. Behind it, the squad follows in perfect formation, their movements synchronized in a mockery of living precision. The battlefield stretches to the gray horizon, marked by disturbed graves and the stumps of long-dead trees. Ash drifts on winds that blow from nowhere. The atmosphere of eternal duty, of orders that will be followed until the sun itself burns out.

## Notes
- Risen Soldiers wearing different heraldry may attack each other if no living targets are present, endlessly refighting [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]
- The "fresh wounds" phenomenon is key to the mystery—the curse doesn't just animate the dead, it preserves them in their moment of death
- Higher-CR undead (Officers, Knights) command squads of Risen Soldiers
- Destroying all Risen Soldiers is impossible while [[The Blackened Crown]] exists
