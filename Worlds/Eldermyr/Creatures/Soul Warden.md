# Soul Warden

## Overview
Soul Wardens are entities that exist at the intersection of [[The Ashen Fields]]' curse and the thing called [[The Unnamed]]. They appear where mass death has occurred, harvesting souls before they can reach the Chronicler's embrace and funneling them to whatever feeds beneath the battlefield. Cloaked in darkness and wielding authority over the spirits of the dead, they are among the most terrifying creatures to emerge from the cursed ground—proof that something far worse than an army of corpses is awakening.

## Traits

### Incorporeal Movement
The Soul Warden can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### Soul Sight
The Soul Warden can see the souls of living creatures within 60 feet. It knows when a creature within this range is reduced to 0 hit points, even if it cannot see the creature.

### Harvest the Dying
When a creature within 30 feet of the Soul Warden dies, the Soul Warden can use its reaction to attempt to harvest the creature's soul. The dying creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or have its soul claimed. A creature whose soul is claimed cannot be raised by any means short of a *wish* spell until the Soul Warden is destroyed.

### Bound to the Unnamed
The Soul Warden cannot be turned. If it would be destroyed, it instead retreats to [[The Ashen Fields]] and reforms in 1d4 days unless [[The Blackened Crown]] is destroyed.

## Actions

### Soul Rend
*Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

### Wail of the Lost (Recharge 5-6)
The Soul Warden releases the anguished cries of the souls it has harvested. Each creature within 30 feet that isn't undead must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't stunned.

### Command Spirit
The Soul Warden targets one incorporeal undead it can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the Soul Warden for 1 hour. While charmed, the target obeys the Soul Warden's commands.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Soul Wardens appear as hooded figures wreathed in tattered shadows, their forms barely corporeal. Beneath their hoods, there is no face—only a void of absolute darkness that occasionally reveals glimpses of writhing souls. Their "hands" are wisps of shadow that extend and contract, reaching toward the dying. They hover above the ground, leaving no tracks, casting no shadow. When they speak, multiple voices emerge in whispered layers—the voices of the souls they have claimed.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Whispered pleas, distant crying, words spoken in dead languages
- **Smell:** Cold emptiness, the absence of scent
- **Temperature effects:** Profound cold; warmth is drained from the area
- **Magical aura:** Strong necromantic and divine (corrupted) energy

## Behavior

### Temperament
Soul Wardens are purposeful and patient. They do not attack randomly—they position themselves where death will occur and wait. They prioritize harvesting souls over combat, retreating if seriously threatened. They serve [[The Unnamed]] directly, not [[The Mad King|the Figure at the Heart]], though their purposes currently align.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Sapient (focused)

Soul Wardens are intelligent but single-minded. They understand language, recognize tactics, and can communicate, but their existence is dedicated entirely to harvesting souls for their master.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Wait near battles, mass deaths, or cursed areas
- **Preferred prey:** Dying creatures with intact souls
- **Feeding frequency:** Continuous when souls available
- **Territory size:** Concentrated near the Heart and mass graves

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Solitary or Pair

Soul Wardens operate independently, though multiple may converge on sites of significant death.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Sites of mass death, the Heart of [[The Ashen Fields]]
- **Climate preferences:** None
- **Shelter requirements:** None
- **Territory characteristics:** Areas where death is frequent

### Range
[[The Ashen Fields]], particularly concentrated near the mass graves and the Heart.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Created by [[The Unnamed]] from harvested souls
- **Maturation time:** Unknown
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Unnamed]] exists

### Role in Ecosystem
Soul Wardens are the primary mechanism by which [[The Unnamed]] feeds. They intercept souls before they can reach the Chronicler, trapping them and funneling them to whatever entity lurks beneath [[The Ashen Fields]].

## Lore

### Origins
Soul Wardens are not risen dead—they are constructs of pure spiritual energy, created by [[The Unnamed]] to harvest the souls of the dying. They represent the breaking of the Chronicler's covenant: proof that souls are being intercepted before reaching the afterlife. [[The Faith of the Three]] considers their existence the greatest theological crisis in centuries.

### History
The first Soul Warden was witnessed by a [[Grey Wardens|Grey Warden]] scout who survived a skirmish with risen dead. He described a hooded figure that appeared over his dying comrade, reached into the man's chest, and pulled out something luminous before vanishing. The comrade could not be raised.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** Those harvested by Soul Wardens cannot be resurrected by normal means.
2. **True:** They serve something older and worse than [[The Mad King]].
3. **Partially True:** Holy ground bars them. (Temporarily, and not absolutely.)

### Known Individuals
Soul Wardens have no individual identity, but several have been given names by terrified witnesses:
1. **The Silent Shepherd** — A Soul Warden that appears at the edge of battles, never engaging, only harvesting.
2. **The Weeping Hood** — A Soul Warden that makes constant quiet crying sounds, as if mourning the souls it takes.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Soul Wardens avoid direct combat, preferring to wait for creatures to die and harvest their souls. When forced to fight, they use Soul Rend to reduce hit point maximums (potentially killing wounded targets) and Wail of the Lost to stun multiple enemies. They use Command Spirit to turn other undead against the party.

### Strengths
- Incorporeal (most attacks ineffective)
- Can permanently prevent resurrection
- Wail of the Lost can stun multiple targets
- Reforms if destroyed (until source destroyed)

### Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Low physical presence (no grapple, low Strength)
- Focused on harvesting; may ignore combat
- Holy symbols and ground provide some protection

### Group Tactics
Multiple Soul Wardens position themselves around a battle, each harvesting dying creatures from different angles. They do not coordinate attacks—only harvests.

## Treasure

### Body Parts
Soul Wardens leave no physical remains. If permanently destroyed:
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Soul Essence | 150 gp | Contains trapped souls; can be used to communicate with dead |
| Void Fragment | 100 gp | Component for soul-related magic |
| Shadow Cloth | 75 gp | Material for invisibility/stealth enchantments |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **The Harvest:** During a battle with risen dead, a Soul Warden appears and begins harvesting fallen allies. The party must destroy it before it can escape with the souls.

2. **Theological Crisis:** [[The Faith of the Three]] sends the party to confirm the existence of Soul Wardens. They need proof—preferably a captured or destroyed specimen.

3. **Rescue the Soul:** An important NPC was killed within a Soul Warden's reach. The party must track and destroy the Soul Warden before it delivers the soul to [[The Unnamed]], or the NPC can never be raised.

4. **The Interview:** A captured Soul Warden (bound by powerful magic) might answer questions about [[The Unnamed]] and the true nature of the curse. What price might it demand for information?
