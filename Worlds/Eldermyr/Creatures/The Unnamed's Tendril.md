# The Unnamed's Tendril

## Overview
The Unnamed's Tendrils are extensions of the vast, ancient entity that slumbers beneath [[The Ashen Fields]]—the thing that [[The Mad King]] awakened, that feeds on the trapped souls, that is the true source of the curse. These tendrils breach the surface at the Heart and in the deepest Ash Pits, grasping at the living, dragging victims underground to feed their master. They are not undead—they are something older and far worse.

## Traits

### Extension of the Whole
The Tendril is part of [[The Unnamed]] and shares its alien nature. It has no independent existence; destroying it merely severs a small piece of the greater whole. The Unnamed can produce new Tendrils given time.

### Earth Glide
The Tendril can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, it doesn't disturb the material it moves through—until it attacks.

### Magic Resistance
The Tendril has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Alien Mind
The Tendril is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions, read its thoughts, or detect if it is lying. Attempts to contact it telepathically receive only overwhelming hunger and alien malice.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Tendril makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit the same Large or smaller creature, that creature is grappled (escape DC 14).

### Slam
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

### Drag Below (Recharge 5-6)
One creature grappled by the Tendril must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 30 feet toward the Tendril and buried in the earth (requiring an action and a DC 14 Strength check to escape). A buried creature is restrained, can't breathe, and takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the Tendril's turns.

### Corrupting Pulse (Recharge 6)
The Tendril releases a wave of the curse's energy. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save by 5 or more have disadvantage on death saving throws for 1 hour.

## Reactions

### Retract
When the Tendril takes 20 or more damage in a single turn, it can use its reaction to burrow up to half its burrow speed into the ground. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
The Unnamed's Tendrils are massive appendages of glistening, dark flesh—somewhere between muscle, root, and intestine. They are 15-20 feet long when extended, as thick as a human torso, and covered in a film of dark ichor. They have no eyes or obvious sensory organs, but respond to movement and vibration with disturbing accuracy. Where they breach the surface, the earth is corrupted—gray, dead, and slightly warm to the touch. They end in blunt, gripping masses of flesh that can coil around prey.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Wet, organic sounds; grinding of earth; nothing that should be underground
- **Smell:** Rot, ozone, something deeply wrong
- **Temperature effects:** Unnatural warmth at the emergence point
- **Magical aura:** Overwhelming necromantic/aberrant energy; detectable at 100 feet

## Behavior

### Temperament
The Tendrils are extensions of [[The Unnamed]]'s hunger—they seek to grab, crush, and drag prey underground to feed their master. They have no personality, no fear, and no goals beyond feeding. They react to movement and the presence of life with immediate, violent action.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Mindless (instinctual)

The Tendrils have no independent intelligence. They are limbs, not beings. They respond to stimuli and follow the driving hunger of [[The Unnamed]], but cannot think, plan, or communicate.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Emerge from underground, grab prey, drag below
- **Preferred prey:** Any living creature
- **Feeding frequency:** Continuous when prey available
- **Territory size:** Emerge only within [[The Ashen Fields]], particularly near the Heart

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Extension (part of [[The Unnamed]])

Multiple Tendrils may emerge simultaneously but do not coordinate—they are separate limbs of the same creature, each acting independently.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Underground, emerging at cursed locations
- **Climate preferences:** None
- **Shelter requirements:** Underground; cannot survive long on the surface
- **Territory characteristics:** The Heart of [[The Ashen Fields]], Ash Pits

### Range
The Tendrils can only emerge within [[The Ashen Fields]] where the curse is strongest. The Heart has the highest concentration.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** [[The Unnamed]] extends new Tendrils as needed
- **Maturation time:** Unknown
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite; severed Tendrils regrow

### Role in Ecosystem
The Tendrils are [[The Unnamed]]'s primary method of directly interacting with the surface. They drag victims underground to be consumed, feeding the ancient entity.

## Lore

### Origins
[[The Unnamed]] has existed beneath what is now [[The Ashen Fields]] since before human memory. It was dormant for millennia, dreaming beneath the earth. [[The Mad King]]'s rituals during [[The Great War]] awakened it—or perhaps it drew the Mad King to it. Now it stirs, sending Tendrils to the surface to feed as it grows stronger.

### History
The first Tendril emergence was witnessed by [[Lord Draven Karath]] himself, during one of his secret visits to [[The Ashen Fields]]. He claims the Tendril spoke to him in his mind, offering power. Whether this is true or delusion, his contact with [[The Unnamed]] has been ongoing.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** The Tendrils are part of something much larger underground.
2. **True:** Those dragged below are consumed—body and soul.
3. **Unknown:** Destroying enough Tendrils might weaken [[The Unnamed]]. (Possible but unproven.)

### Known Individuals
Tendrils have no individual identity. However, certain locations are known for Tendril activity:
1. **The Heart** — Multiple Tendrils emerge here permanently, creating a forest of grasping flesh.
2. **Pit Alpha** — The deepest Ash Pit, where a single massive Tendril (larger than normal) is partially visible.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Tendrils emerge from underground to attack, using Tremorsense to locate prey. They grab with Slam attacks, then use Drag Below to pull victims underground. Corrupting Pulse is used when multiple enemies are nearby. They use Retract to retreat if badly damaged, returning later.

### Strengths
- High HP (95) and resistances
- Magic Resistance
- Drag Below can remove characters from combat
- Earth Glide makes them hard to pin down

### Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- No ranged attacks
- Mindless; cannot adapt tactics
- Must emerge to attack (predictable locations)

### Group Tactics
Multiple Tendrils attack from different angles, each trying to grapple and drag below different targets. They do not coordinate but their independent attacks create chaos.

## Treasure

### Lair Treasure
The area around Tendril emergence points may contain:
- Remains of previous victims (equipment, valuables)
- Corrupted earth (valuable for dark rituals)
- Nothing from the Tendril itself—it retreats or dissolves when destroyed

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Tendril Ichor | 50 gp | Powerful necromantic component |
| Aberrant Flesh | 75 gp | Component for aberration-related magic |
| Curse Sample | 100 gp | Can be studied to understand [[The Unnamed]] |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **The Heart Approach:** The party must approach the Heart of [[The Ashen Fields]]. They must navigate past multiple Tendrils that emerge from the cursed earth.

2. **Rescue the Dragged:** An ally or important NPC was dragged underground by a Tendril. The party must dig them out before they're consumed.

3. **Communion:** [[Lord Draven Karath]] claims he can arrange a "meeting" with [[The Unnamed]] through one of its Tendrils. Is it an opportunity or a trap?

4. **The Growing Dark:** Tendrils are emerging closer to [[Chernogrod]] than ever before. [[The Unnamed]] is expanding its reach.

- The Tendrils establish that the curse has a physical source underground
- Drag Below creates urgency—buried allies are in immediate danger
- Destroying Tendrils is temporary; [[The Unnamed]] is the real threat
