# Whisper Shade

## Overview
Whisper Shades are stealthy undead assassins that emerge from the darkest places of [[The Ashen Fields]]—the shadows of the mass graves, the darkness beneath the ash clouds, the places where light refuses to go. They are scouts and killers for the undead army, slipping past defenses to murder sentries, spread fear, and gather intelligence. Unlike the mindless risen dead, Whisper Shades retain enough cunning to hunt with patience and precision.

## Traits

### Incorporeal Movement
The Whisper Shade can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### Shadow Stealth
While in dim light or darkness, the Whisper Shade can take the Hide action as a bonus action. It has advantage on Stealth checks made in darkness.

### Sunlight Sensitivity
While in sunlight, the Whisper Shade has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Assassinate
During its first turn, the Whisper Shade has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the Shade scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Whisper Shade makes two Shadow Touch attacks.

### Shadow Touch
*Melee Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have its Strength reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

### Terrifying Whisper
The Whisper Shade speaks directly into the mind of one creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the target must take the Dash action and move away from the Shade by the safest route on each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Shadow Step
The Whisper Shade magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is in dim light or darkness.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Whisper Shades are darker than darkness—voids in the shape of humanoids that seem to drink in light around them. They have no discernible features except for two points of pale, cold light where eyes might be. Their forms flicker and shift, becoming nearly invisible in shadow but revealing disturbing suggestions of faces, hands, and reaching limbs when light touches them. They move silently, hovering just above the ground, and leave a trail of deepened shadow in their wake.

### Sensory Presence
- **Sounds:** Whispers at the edge of hearing—names, warnings, threats
- **Smell:** None
- **Temperature effects:** Noticeable cold when nearby; breath frosts
- **Magical aura:** Moderate necromantic energy; causes unease even before seen

## Behavior

### Temperament
Whisper Shades are patient, cunning hunters. They stalk their prey for hours, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They prefer to kill silently—eliminating sentries, guards, and isolated targets without alerting others. When forced into open combat, they use mobility and fear effects to divide and isolate enemies.

### Intelligence
**Intelligence Level:** Cunning (tactical awareness)

Whisper Shades retain enough intelligence to follow complex orders, identify high-value targets, and adapt their tactics. They can communicate and even negotiate, though they prefer to kill.

### Hunting/Feeding
- **Hunting methods:** Stalking, ambush, assassination
- **Preferred prey:** Lone sentries, sleeping targets, anyone alone
- **Feeding frequency:** Do not feed in the traditional sense; draw strength from kills
- **Territory size:** Assigned by [[Dread Commander|Dread Commanders]]; range widely

### Social Structure
**Social Type:** Solitary or Pair

Whisper Shades operate alone or in pairs for coordinated assassinations. They do not form social bonds.

## Ecology

### Habitat
- **Terrain types:** Any area of darkness or shadow
- **Climate preferences:** Cold, dark environments
- **Shelter requirements:** Darkness; cannot remain in bright light
- **Territory characteristics:** The darkest parts of [[The Ashen Fields]]

### Range
[[The Ashen Fields]] and beyond; can travel farther than physical undead.

### Life Cycle
- **Reproduction method:** Created from the shadows of the violently killed
- **Maturation time:** Immediate
- **Lifespan:** Indefinite while [[The Blackened Crown]] endures

### Role in Ecosystem
Whisper Shades are the assassins and scouts of the undead army. They eliminate sentries before attacks, gather intelligence on enemy movements, and spread fear by killing isolated targets.

## Lore

### Origins
Whisper Shades are born from the final shadows of those who died in darkness—soldiers killed in nighttime ambushes, people murdered in their sleep, victims of treachery in the dark. The curse gave form to their dying terror and hatred, creating hunters that exist in the space between shadow and substance.

### History
Whisper Shades began appearing outside [[The Ashen Fields]] two weeks ago, when a garrison near [[Volkovka]] lost six sentries in a single night without a single alarm being raised. The attacks have continued, spreading fear among border patrols.

### Myths & Legends
1. **True:** They can speak—and they use victims' names.
2. **True:** They cannot exist in bright light; magical light forces them to flee.
3. **Partially True:** They know secrets of those they kill. (They learn secrets through observation, not consumption.)

### Known Individuals
1. **The Named One** — A Whisper Shade that whispers the names of the dead it has taken. The list grows longer each night.
2. **The Paired Shadows** — Two Shades that hunt together, coordinating kills on opposite ends of patrol routes.

## Combat Tactics

### Behavior
Whisper Shades prefer assassination to combat. They use Shadow Stealth to approach unseen, Assassinate to deal critical damage on surprised targets, and Shadow Step to escape retaliation. In open combat, they use Terrifying Whisper to split the party and pick off frightened targets. They retreat if seriously wounded, returning later.

### Strengths
- Excellent stealth (+8)
- Assassinate provides critical hits on surprised targets
- Shadow Step provides excellent mobility
- Strength drain can kill weakened targets

### Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to radiant damage
- Sunlight Sensitivity is crippling
- Moderate HP (45)
- Cannot function in bright light

### Group Tactics
Paired Shades coordinate strikes on opposite sides of a group, using Terrifying Whisper to cause chaos while the other assassinates the most dangerous target.

## Treasure

### Body Parts
| Part | Value | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Shadow Essence | 40 gp | Component for stealth/darkness magic |
| Whisper Fragment | 30 gp | Can store and replay spoken messages |
| Void Tears | 25 gp | Component for fear-based magic |

## Encounter Ideas

1. **Sentry Elimination:** The party discovers their camp's sentries have been killed silently. A Whisper Shade is still nearby, waiting for the next opportunity.

2. **The Whispering Dark:** During a night journey near [[The Ashen Fields]], party members begin hearing their names whispered from the darkness. Something is following them.

3. **Assassination Warning:** A Whisper Shade delivers a message from [[The Mad King|the Figure at the Heart]]: leave [[The Ashen Fields]], or join the dead. Then it attacks.

4. **The Price of Light:** The party must cross a lightless area—caves, underground ruins, a magically darkened zone. Whisper Shades hunt freely there.
