# Audience with [[Lord Varic Valdren|the Regent]]

## Overview
The party has gained an audience with [[Lord Varic Valdren]], Regent of Eldermyr and the most powerful man in the realm. He has summoned them to his private study in [[Lord Varic Valdren|the Regent]]'s Tower—not the formal throne room, which suggests this is personal business. [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] wants something, but he won't say what until he's assessed whether they're useful, trustworthy, or dangerous. This is a test, and the party doesn't know what answers he wants.

## Classification

### Encounter Type
**Social Type:** Negotiation / Assessment

**Tone:** Tense / Formal / Probing

### Stakes
**What's at Risk:** Alliance with the most powerful faction, access to resources, potential enmity of [[Lord Varic Valdren|the Regent]]

**Importance:** Major (this encounter can shape the campaign's political landscape)

### Difficulty
**Social Difficulty:** Complex

**Why:** [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] is intelligent, experienced, and reveals nothing he doesn't intend to. He's testing the party while appearing to simply converse.

## The Situation

### Context
[[Lord Varic Valdren]] rules Eldermyr in all but name. As Regent for his young grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]], he controls the treasury, [[Aldersgate|the capital]]'s garrison, and much of the realm's trade. He has heard of the party—their actions have drawn attention—and he wants to know what kind of pieces they are on the board. Are they useful tools? Potential allies? Threats to be neutralized?

The party has been summoned to his private study, a luxurious but working space filled with maps, correspondence, and the tools of governance. This is where [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] actually rules; the throne room is for show.

### What the Party Wants
- Information about the succession crisis
- Support for their goals (whatever those may be)
- Resources, access, or legitimacy
- To avoid making an enemy of the most powerful man in the realm

### What the NPC Wants
- To assess the party's capabilities and loyalties
- To determine if they can be useful to [[House Valdren]]
- To discover what they know about the rising dead (and who else knows)
- To potentially recruit them—or neutralize them if they're threats

### The Conflict
[[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] won't offer anything without knowing what he's getting. The party can't know what he wants without revealing their own goals. Both sides are probing, testing, and neither fully trusts the other.
