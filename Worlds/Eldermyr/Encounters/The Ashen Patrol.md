# The Ashen Patrol

## Overview
The party encounters a patrol of the risen dead near the edge of the Ashen Fields—soldiers from the Great War who still march their old routes, attacking anything living that crosses their path. Unlike mindless undead, these soldiers retain fragments of their training and tactics. They fight as a unit, and somewhere among them, a sergeant still issues commands.

### Powerful Creature Warning
> [!warning] High CR Warning
> The Wight can drain life and create spawn. Focus fire may be necessary.

**Highest CR Present:** 3

**Party Level:** 5

**Risk Assessment:** Manageable, but the Wight's Life Drain can turn the tide if not addressed quickly

### Enemy Details

#### The Ashen Sergeant (Wight)
**Role:** Leader / Controller

**Key Abilities:**
- Life Drain (HP and max HP reduction)
- Sunlight Sensitivity (disadvantage in bright light)
- Commands other undead with tactical awareness

**Tactics:** The Sergeant hangs back, directing troops and engaging only when the party is weakened. Uses Life Drain on isolated targets. If reduced to half HP, becomes aggressive.

**Customization:** This Wight wears the tattered uniform of a Karath infantry sergeant. It still calls out orders in a hoarse voice: "Hold the line! They shall not pass!"

#### Ashen Soldiers (Ghouls)
**Role:** Striker / Swarmer

**Key Abilities:**
- Claws with paralysis
- Pack tactics with each other

**Tactics:** Ghouls move in pairs, attempting to flank targets. They focus on paralyzed victims to maximize damage.

**Customization:** These ghouls wear rusted armor fragments and carry shields they cannot properly use. Some still hold broken swords.

#### Ashen Archers (Improved Skeletons)
**Role:** Artillery

**Key Abilities:**
- Shortbow attacks
- +1 to hit over standard skeletons

**Tactics:** Archers maintain distance, targeting spellcasters and ranged attackers. They reposition if approached.

#### War Hounds (Zombie Dogs)
**Role:** Harasser

**Key Abilities:**
- Pack Tactics
- Trip attacks (bonus action shove attempt on hit)

**Tactics:** The hounds circle around to attack from the rear, trying to knock down spellcasters.

### Enemy Tactics

#### Opening Round
- Archers open fire from concealment (surprise if party fails Perception DC 14)
- Ghouls advance in two groups of three
- War Hounds circle to flank
- Sergeant holds position, observing

#### General Strategy
- Ghouls attempt to paralyze the most dangerous-looking melee fighter
- Archers focus fire on spellcasters
- If a PC is paralyzed, two Ghouls focus them while others engage other targets
- Sergeant engages only when victory seems assured or defeat threatens

#### Retreat Conditions
- If the Sergeant falls, remaining undead become mindless and fight to destruction
- The undead do not retreat; they are incapable of fear

#### Morale
**Morale Break:** Never (undead)

## Battlefield

### Location
**Setting:** A ruined farmstead on the edge of the Ashen Fields, with a collapsed barn and stone walls

**Dimensions:** 80 feet × 60 feet

**Lighting:** Dim (perpetual overcast in the Reach; bright light sources give advantage against the Wight)

**Terrain Type:** Cluttered (ruined structures, walls, debris)

### Map Features
| Feature | Location | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Collapsed Barn | Northwest | Provides cover; Archers start here |
| Stone Walls | Throughout | Half cover (+2 AC) |
| Farmhouse Ruin | East | Three-quarters cover; the Sergeant starts here |
| Dead Crops | Center | Difficult terrain |
| Dry Well | Southeast | 20-foot drop if not noticed (DC 12 Perception) |

### Cover & Concealment
| Cover Type | Location | AC Bonus |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Half Cover | Stone walls | +2 |
| Three-Quarters | Farmhouse ruins | +5 |
| Total Cover | Behind barn wall | Untargetable |

### Difficult Terrain
| Area | Cause | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| Center field | Dead crops, uneven ground | Movement costs double |
| Around well | Loose stones | Movement costs double |

### Elevation
| Position | Height | Advantage/Disadvantage |
|----------|--------|------------------------|
| Barn loft (collapsed) | 10 feet | Archers have advantage on ranged; disadvantage on melee defense |
| Well rim | -20 feet if fallen | Creature falls prone, takes 2d6 damage |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Trigger | Effect | Save DC |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Dry Well | Southeast | Creature enters square without seeing | Falls 20 feet, 2d6 damage, prone | DEX 12 to grab edge |
| Ash Clouds | If fire used | Fire spells in dead crops | 10-foot radius obscurement | None |

### Interactive Elements
| Object | Location | Action to Use | Effect |
|--------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Wagon Wheel | Near barn | Action to roll | Improvised weapon 1d8 or difficult terrain line |
| Lantern Oil | Farmhouse | Bonus action | Creates slick or fuel for fire |
| Bell (on post) | North edge | Action to ring | Draws all undead attention for 1 round |

## Combat Flow

### Initiative Modifiers
- If the party approaches openly, undead have advantage on initiative (they see the living coming)
- If the party approaches stealthily and succeeds, they gain surprise

### Round-by-Round Expectations

#### Round 1
**Expected Actions:**
- Archers fire from barn
- Ghouls emerge from crop rows and close distance
- War Hounds sprint toward party rear
- Sergeant observes, may cast a tactical shout (bonus action Help to one Ghoul)

**Key Decisions:**
- Does the party advance, hold, or retreat?
- Does someone target the archers or the approaching melee?

#### Round 2-3
**Escalation:**
- Ghouls reach melee range; paralysis becomes a threat
- War Hounds attack from behind
- Sergeant engages if the party seems to be winning

**Turning Points:**
- If a PC is paralyzed, the battle becomes desperate
- If the archers are eliminated, the party gains tactical flexibility
- Killing the Sergeant may cause confusion (undead freeze for one round)

#### Later Rounds
**Resolution Path:**
- Systematic elimination of ghouls after dealing with key threats
- Mopping up archers and hounds
- Or, if going badly, fighting retreat

### Lair Actions
*Not applicable—this is an outdoor encounter.*

### Legendary Actions
*The Ashen Sergeant has no legendary actions but may use Reactions:*

**Tactical Command (Reaction):** When a ghoul within 30 feet misses an attack, the Sergeant can shout a correction, allowing the ghoul to reroll the attack.

## Objectives & Victory

### Primary Objective
Survive the encounter; defeat or escape the patrol.

### Secondary Objectives
1. Capture evidence of the dead rising (armor fragments, orders)
2. Identify what unit these soldiers belonged to (History DC 15)

### Victory Conditions
**Complete Victory:** All undead destroyed; party takes no casualties

**Partial Victory:** Undead destroyed but party member died or was infected (ghoul fever if optional rules used)

**Pyrrhic Victory:** Party escapes but cannot stop the patrol from continuing its route

### Failure Conditions
**Defeat:** TPK or capture (ghouls eat the living; survivors rise as undead)

**Complication:** A party member is killed and rises as a ghoul under the Sergeant's command

## Complications

### Reinforcements
**Trigger:** Combat lasts more than 8 rounds

**Reinforcement Details:**
| Creature | Quantity | Arrives Round |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Ghouls | 3 | Round 9 |

*These were patrolling nearby and were drawn by the sounds of combat.*

### Environmental Changes
| Round | Event | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 4 | Ash Storm | Light obscurement in 30-foot radius around battlefield |
| 7 | Storm Intensifies | Heavy obscurement; ranged attacks have disadvantage |

### Third Parties
- Other survivors may be hiding in the area; if the party is losing, a local refugee might create a distraction (DM option)
- If combat is loud and long, House Karath scouts may arrive afterward to investigate

### Time Pressure
**Countdown:** None (but reinforcements arrive at round 9)

**Consequence of Delay:** More undead; potential for being overwhelmed

## Rewards

### Experience
**Combat XP:** 2,900 XP (divided among party)

**Bonus XP:** +200 for creative tactics, +100 for capturing evidence

### Treasure

## DM Notes

### Running the Encounter
- Describe the wrongness of these soldiers—they move in formation, follow orders, but their movements are jerky and unnatural
- The Sergeant's voice is the creepiest element; he sounds almost reasonable
- Emphasize the tragedy: these were people, fighting a war they didn't understand, and now they can't stop

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Use fire on crops | Ash clouds create obscurement; undead unaffected |
| Ring the bell | All undead target the ringer for 1 round (tactical opportunity) |
| Try to reason with the Sergeant | He pauses, confused, then attacks more viciously |
| Run immediately | Undead pursue for 500 feet, then return to patrol |

### Telegraphing Danger
- Describe the unnatural silence before the encounter
- The smell of rot and ash
- Birds fleeing in the opposite direction
- If players investigate, DC 14 Perception spots movement in the crops

### Dramatic Moments
- The Sergeant recognizing something about a PC ("You... you wear the colors of the living. We were living once.")
- A ghoul pausing before attacking, its face twisted in what might be sorrow
- The medal on the Sergeant's chest: "For Valor at the Fields"

## Secrets

1. **The Heart.** The Sergeant's orders mention "the heart." This refers to the center of the Ashen Fields, where the Figure resides.

2. **Karath Scouts.** Lord Draven's scouts have been watching this area. If the party defeats the patrol, they'll be approached within the day.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Northern Approach:** Following the patrol's route backward leads toward the Ashen Fields' center. What are they guarding?

2. **The Medal's Owner:** The Sergeant was Sergeant Aldric Vorn, whose family still lives in Chernogrod. They thought he died a hero.
