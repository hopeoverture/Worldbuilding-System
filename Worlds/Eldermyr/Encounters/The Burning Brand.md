# The Burning Brand

## Overview

The party enters [[Port Corsair]]'s tiefling quarter seeking information, passage, or sanctuary. The Branded District is welcoming to outsiders who come in peace, but suspicious of strangers who might be agents of [[The Faith of the Three]] or [[House Thorne]]. Getting what they need requires navigating cultural sensitivities, proving trustworthiness, and possibly gaining an audience with [[Mordai the Branded]]—the de facto leader of the tiefling community.

## Classification

### Difficulty
**Difficulty Level:** Moderate (social stakes are high; failure means losing access)

**Party Level:** 3-6 (social encounters scale well)

**Party Size:** Any

### Encounter Type
**Social Style:** Roleplay with skill challenges

**Primary Skills:** Persuasion, Insight, Deception (risky), Performance

**Objective:** Gain trust, information, or passage through Mordai's network

## The Setting

### The Branded District

The tiefling quarter of [[Port Corsair]] is a close-knit neighborhood of approximately 2,400 souls. Unlike the rest of the city's rough-and-tumble atmosphere, the Branded District feels almost like a small village—neighbors know each other, children play in the streets, and strangers are noticed immediately.

**First Impressions:**
- The scent of unfamiliar spices from street vendors
- Tieflings walking openly, horns and tails on full display
- Holy symbols of [[The Faith of the Three]] are conspicuously absent
- Subtle scrutiny—the party is being watched from the moment they enter

### The Burning Brand Tavern

**Description:** A two-story stone building at the district's heart, serving as tavern, meeting hall, and community center. The sign shows a stylized brand mark wreathed in flames—transforming a symbol of persecution into one of resilience.

**Atmosphere:**
- Warm and welcoming to those who belong
- Guarded toward strangers until proven trustworthy
- Quiet conversations stop when outsiders enter

**Key Features:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Main Room | Common room with long tables, warm fireplace |
| The Brand Wall | Memorial wall bearing the brands of community members |
| Private Booths | Curtained areas for sensitive conversations |
| Upper Floor | Mordai's office and emergency exit routes |

## Key NPCs

### Tavern Staff

#### Sera Nighthollow
**Role:** Bartender and first contact

**Appearance:** Young female tiefling with blue-black skin, silver horns, and a disarming smile that doesn't quite reach her watchful eyes.

**Personality:** Friendly on the surface, gathering information. She decides who gets to see Mordai.

**Key Information:**
- Asks casual questions that are actually probing for threats
- Responds well to genuine respect for tieflings
- Hostile to anyone displaying Faith symbols or Thorne colors

**Attitude Starting Point:** Indifferent

#### Calder Emberwrath
**Role:** Bouncer and Mordai's trusted enforcer

**Appearance:** Massive male tiefling with red skin, scarred face, and brands visible on his forearms. Arms crossed, blocking the stairs to the upper floor.

**Personality:** Silent, observant, intimidating. Violence is always an option he's prepared for.

**Key Information:**
- Doesn't speak unless necessary
- Will physically prevent anyone from going upstairs without permission
- Has killed people who threatened the community

**Attitude Starting Point:** Hostile (toward strangers approaching the stairs)

### Mordai the Branded

**See Full Stats:** [[Mordai the Branded]]

**Role:** Community leader, potential patron

**Appearance:** Tall, lean tiefling with crimson skin and swept-back horns. His shirt is deliberately open to show the Faith's brands on his chest—holy symbols burned into his flesh.

**Personality:** Charming, careful, calculating. He has protected his people for decades through intelligence and ruthlessness.

**What He Wants:**
- To protect his community
- Information about threats from the mainland
- Capable allies who don't care about tiefling stigma

**What He Offers:**
- Passage through his smuggling network
- Information about the Western Shore
- Safe harbor in the Branded District
- Future favors owed

## The Social Challenge

### Phase 1: Entering the District

**Skill Challenge:** Getting through the district to the Burning Brand without causing offense

**Observations:**
- A Faith pendant or Thorne livery will attract hostile attention
- Speaking Infernal grants advantage on first impressions
- Overt weapons make people nervous

**Complications:**
| If the Party... | Then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| Displays Faith symbols | Followed by enforcers, refused service |
| Acts superior or condescending | Prices quadruple, no one talks |
| Treats tieflings as equals | Neutral reception, conversation possible |
| Shows genuine sympathy for persecution | Warm reception, faster trust |

### Phase 2: The Burning Brand

**Initial Reaction:** Sera Nighthollow greets the party, takes their order, and subtly probes their intentions.

**Trust Threshold:** The party must accumulate 5 Successes before 3 Failures to earn an audience with Mordai.

**Skill Options:**
| Skill | DC | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Persuasion | 13 | Honest explanation of why they're here |
| Insight | 14 | Recognizing what Sera really wants to know |
| Performance | 12 | Entertaining the crowd, showing they're not a threat |
| History | 15 | Knowing something about tiefling persecution |
| Religion | 16 | Demonstrating knowledge of tiefling culture (not the Faith) |
| Deception | 16 | Risky—failure means they leave or face Calder |

**Bonuses:**
- Speaking Infernal: +2 to Charisma checks
- Mentioning a shared enemy (Faith, Thorne): +1 to next check
- Buying rounds for the house: Automatic success (costs 5 gp)
- Party includes a tiefling: One automatic success

**Complications:**
| If the Party... | Then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| Lies about their purpose | Sera knows; -2 to all future checks |
| Mentions working with the Faith | Immediate failure; asked to leave |
| Gets aggressive | Calder intervenes; combat possible |
| Offers genuine help | +2 to next check |

### Phase 3: Meeting Mordai

**Trigger:** 5 Successes in Phase 2

**Setting:** Mordai's upstairs office—comfortable but with clear escape routes

**Mordai's Approach:**
- Welcoming but watchful
- Speaks in metaphors that can't be used against him
- Assesses the party's usefulness and trustworthiness

**Negotiation:**
| Party Wants | Mordai's Price |
|-------------|----------------|
| Information about the Shore | Carry a message (no questions about contents) |
| Passage through smuggling network | 100 gp per person or a favor |
| Sanctuary in the district | Deal with someone threatening his people |
| Mordai as patron | Complete a significant task first |

**What Mordai Will Trade:**
- Detailed maps of the Western Shore's hidden coves
- Introduction to ship captains who don't ask questions
- Safe passage for tieflings fleeing the mainland
- Information about [[House Valdren]]'s activities

**What Mordai Won't Do:**
- Betray his people's trust
- Work against tiefling interests anywhere
- Deal with Faith representatives (he'll kill them first)

## Complications

### The Watcher

**Trigger:** Party spends more than an hour in the district

**Event:** A human in nondescript clothes watches the Burning Brand from across the street. He's an informant for [[The Faith of the Three]], tracking tiefling contacts.

**Options:**
| If the Party... | Then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| Ignores him | He notes their presence; possible Faith trouble later |
| Confronts him openly | He flees; party gains +1 with Mordai |
| Captures him discreetly | Mordai is very interested; automatic success |
| Kills him publicly | Causes scene; Valdren authorities investigate |

### The Refugee Ship

**Trigger:** While party is present, a ship arrives with tiefling refugees from the mainland

**Event:** 15 tieflings, including children, have been smuggled from [[The Eastern March]]. They're exhausted, frightened, and need help unloading before authorities notice.

**Opportunity:**
- Helping earns massive trust (2 automatic successes with Mordai)
- Refugees share recent news from the mainland
- Possible hook: one refugee knows something important

### The Inquisitor's Proxy

**Trigger:** Party stays overnight in the district

**Event:** A "merchant" arrives seeking to "do business" with Mordai. He's actually an agent of [[High Confessor Maren]], investigating reports of unauthorized tiefling activity.

**Complication:** Mordai asks the party to handle it discreetly—a test of their capabilities and discretion.

## Rewards

### Social Success

**Information Gained:**
- Maps of the Western Shore's smuggling routes
- Names of trustworthy ship captains
- News from the Branded District's information network
- Warning about [[The Faith of the Three]]'s increasing surveillance

**Relationship Established:**
- Mordai remembers those who prove trustworthy
- The Branded District becomes a safe harbor
- Future access to tiefling resources and networks

### Favors Owed

| Favor Level | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| Minor | Carry a sealed message; don't ask what's inside |
| Moderate | Escort refugees through dangerous territory |
| Major | Eliminate a threat to the tiefling community |

### Material Rewards

| Item | Source | Value |
|------|--------|-------|
| Smuggler's Map | Mordai gift | 50 gp (to collectors) |
| Passage tokens | For the network | Priceless |
| Information | As negotiated | Varies |

## Scaling

### For Lower-Level Parties (1-2)
- Reduce DCs by 2
- Mordai sends a lieutenant instead of meeting personally
- Stakes are lower (information only, no major favors)

### For Higher-Level Parties (7+)
- Increase DCs by 2
- Mordai has heard of the party; expectations are higher
- The Faith is actively hunting them; complications increase
- Stakes include faction-level alliances

## DM Notes

### Running the Encounter

**Tone:** Welcoming but watchful. The tieflings want to like outsiders, but experience has taught them caution.

**Key Theme:** Persecution creates solidarity. The tieflings protect each other because no one else will.

**Roleplaying Mordai:**
- Never threatening, always smiling
- Every word is chosen carefully
- His anger is cold, not hot—more dangerous for it
- He genuinely cares about his people

### Common Player Actions

| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to intimidate | Calder appears; 50 tieflings watch; very bad idea |
| Offer to convert tieflings | Laughed out of the district (best case) |
| Share personal stories of injustice | Earns genuine sympathy |
| Ask about the brands | Mordai shows them; tells the stories |

### Dramatic Moments

- Mordai opening his shirt to show his brands: "Three times they tried to purify me. Three times I refused to die."
- A child staring at the party with wonder—they've never seen humans who didn't want to hurt them
- The moment the tavern's suspicion shifts to acceptance

## Secrets

1. **The Smuggling Routes** lead everywhere—including to resistance cells in [[House Thorne]] territory and contacts in [[Aldersgate]] itself.

2. **Mordai has spawn** in every major port in Eldermyr. His information network is far more extensive than he lets on.

3. **The Faith knows** about the Branded District but [[House Valdren]] protects it—tieflings are too economically useful to purge.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Extraction:** Mordai asks the party to rescue a tiefling family from [[Thornhall]] before the inquisitors arrive.

2. **The Traitor:** Someone in the district is feeding information to the Faith. Mordai needs outsiders to investigate.

3. **The Inquisitor:** A Faith inquisitor is coming to [[Port Corsair]]. Mordai needs help ensuring the visit goes smoothly.
