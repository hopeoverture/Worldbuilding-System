# The Frozen Hunters

## Overview

The party travels through [[The Northlands]] in winter when they're hunted by a pack of winter wolves led by an alpha of unusual intelligence. These aren't random predators—they're organized hunters who've learned that humanoids carry metal, food, and sometimes magic. The pack uses terrain, weather, and pack tactics with frightening coordination.

### Powerful Creature Warning
> [!warning] Pack Tactics
> Winter wolves are dangerous individually; as a coordinated pack with an intelligent alpha, they're lethal. The alpha directs pack movement and focuses fire.

**Highest CR Present:** 4 (Winter Wolf Alpha)

**Party Level:** 5

**Risk Assessment:** Dangerous. Cold Breath can devastate clustered parties.

### Enemy Details

#### The Alpha (Winter Wolf, Enhanced)
**Role:** Leader / Controller

**Enhancements:**
- HP: 95 (increased from 75)
- Intelligence: 10 (unusually clever for wolves)
- Bonus Action: Pack Command (one pack member may move up to half its speed)

**Key Abilities:**
- Cold Breath (15-foot cone, 4d8 cold, DC 12 CON)
- Pack Tactics (advantage when ally adjacent)
- Snow Camouflage (advantage on Stealth in snow)

**Tactics:** The Alpha hangs back initially, directing the pack. It uses Cold Breath on clusters, then engages weakened targets. If reduced to half HP, it calls a retreat and tries again later.

**Appearance:** Massive white wolf, nearly horse-sized, with frost forming on its breath and ice-blue eyes that show unsettling intelligence.

#### Winter Wolves (3)
**Role:** Striker / Flanker

**Key Abilities:**
- Cold Breath (recharge 5-6)
- Pack Tactics
- 75 HP each

**Tactics:** Attack from multiple directions. Two engage the front while one circles for the rear. Coordinate Cold Breath to catch multiple targets.

#### Pack Wolves (6)
**Role:** Swarmer / Distraction

**Key Abilities:**
- Pack Tactics
- Keen Hearing and Smell

**Tactics:** Harass spellcasters, trip targets, and provide Pack Tactics advantage to winter wolves. Will sacrifice themselves to protect winter wolves.

#### Ice Mephits (2)
**Role:** Harasser / Vision Denial

**Key Abilities:**
- Fog Cloud (on death, 5-foot radius)
- Frost Breath (15-foot cone, 1d6 cold)
- Flight

**Tactics:** Stay airborne, use Frost Breath to slow targets, die tactically to create obscurement for wolves.

### Enemy Tactics

#### Pre-Combat
- Pack stalks the party for 1d4 hours before attacking
- Wolves wait for exhaustion, distraction, or camp
- Mephits scout from above, difficult to spot against white sky

#### Opening Round
- Mephits begin Frost Breath harassment
- Pack wolves emerge from snow (Stealth DC 16 to spot)
- Winter wolves approach from three directions
- Alpha hangs back 60 feet, observing

#### General Strategy
- Focus fire on the most dangerous target (spellcaster or healer)
- Use Cold Breath when 2+ targets clustered
- Pack wolves drag down prone targets
- Alpha commands repositioning

#### Retreat Conditions
- Alpha at half HP or below
- More than half winter wolves dead
- Any major threat (high-level spell, effective fire damage)

**Important:** A retreating pack will stalk and attack again in 1d4 hours, choosing a worse moment for the party.

#### Morale
**Morale Break:** Alpha flees or dies → remaining pack scatters and becomes individual threats

## Battlefield

### Location
**Setting:** Snow-covered wilderness during a light snowfall

**Dimensions:** Open terrain, 200 feet × 200 feet (wolves will use the full space)

**Lighting:** Bright (snow glare) or dim (if evening/overcast)

**Terrain Type:** Difficult terrain (deep snow)

### Map Features
| Feature | Location | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Snow Drifts | Throughout | Difficult terrain; wolves ignore |
| Frozen Stream | Center | Slippery (DC 10 DEX or prone) |
| Pine Copse | Northwest | Provides cover; wolves use for ambush |
| Boulder Cluster | Southeast | Half cover; good defensive position |
| Frozen Pond | East | Thin ice (DC 12 to notice); 20-foot drop, 2d6 cold damage |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Trigger | Effect | Save DC |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Deep Snow | Throughout | Movement | Difficult terrain (wolves exempt) | None |
| Thin Ice | Frozen Pond | Weight over 150 lbs | Falls into freezing water | DEX 12 |
| Wind Gusts | Random | Each round, 25% chance | Ranged attacks disadvantage | None |
| Cold Exposure | Everywhere | Combat exceeds 10 rounds | CON save or exhaustion | 10 |

### Cover & Concealment
| Cover Type | Location | AC Bonus |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Half Cover | Boulders, trees | +2 |
| Falling Snow | Everywhere | -2 to Perception |
| Wolves in Snow | Ground level | +5 Stealth for wolves |

## Combat Flow

### Initiative Modifiers
- Wolves have advantage on initiative (they chose when to attack)
- Party members with Passive Perception 16+ aren't surprised
- Otherwise, surprised for first round

### Round-by-Round Expectations

#### Round 1
**Expected Actions:**
- Mephits use Frost Breath on clustered targets
- Pack wolves emerge and engage anyone isolated
- Winter wolves close distance; one may use Cold Breath
- Alpha observes, uses Pack Command

**Key Decisions:**
- Does the party cluster (vulnerable to Cold Breath) or spread (vulnerable to isolation)?
- Target the wolves or try to identify the Alpha?

#### Round 2-3
**Escalation:**
- Winter wolves use Cold Breath on any cluster of 2+
- Pack wolves attempt to trip targets
- Mephits focus on spellcasters
- Alpha engages if opportunity presents

**Turning Points:**
- Killing a winter wolf changes pack confidence
- Killing the Alpha ends coordinated tactics
- Fire damage scares the pack; disadvantage on next attack

#### Round 4+
**Resolution Path:**
- If Alpha wounded, pack retreats to regroup
- If party breaking, wolves become more aggressive
- Combat typically ends with retreat, not total annihilation

### Legendary Actions (Alpha Only)

The Alpha has 2 legendary actions, choosing from:

**Commanding Howl (1 Action):** One pack wolf or winter wolf within 60 feet can immediately move up to its speed.

**Alpha's Gaze (2 Actions):** Target within 30 feet must succeed DC 12 Wisdom save or be frightened until end of their next turn.

## Objectives & Victory

### Primary Objective
Survive the wolf pack attack.

### Secondary Objectives
1. Kill or drive off the Alpha (ends coordinated attack)
2. Recover wolf pelts (valuable in the Northlands)
3. Identify why the pack is so organized (Alpha wears a collar—a clue)

### Victory Conditions
**Complete Victory:** Alpha killed; party takes minimal casualties

**Partial Victory:** Pack driven off; will return later

**Pyrrhic Victory:** Party survives but exhausted/wounded; wolves will stalk

### Failure Conditions
**Defeat:** TPK (wolves drag bodies to lair)

**Complication:** Party forced to abandon supplies or mounts

## Complications

### Reinforcements
**Trigger:** Combat lasts 8+ rounds

**Reinforcement Details:**
| Creature | Quantity | Arrives Round |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Pack Wolves | 4 | Round 9 |

*Additional pack members from the territory*

### Environmental Changes
| Round | Event | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 5 | Wind Increases | Ranged attacks at disadvantage |
| 8 | Temperature Drops | CON save DC 10 or 1 level exhaustion |
| 10+ | Blizzard Begins | Heavily obscured beyond 30 feet |

### The Collar
**Discovery:** The Alpha wears a leather collar with a bronze tag. This is deeply unusual for a wild wolf.

**Investigation (DC 14):** The collar is inscribed with symbols—ownership marks in an old Northlands dialect.

**The Truth:** This pack was trained by someone at [[Frostfang Lodge]]—the Alpha's unusual intelligence comes from years of conditioning. The lodge's new occupants have released the wolves to hunt in their territory.

## Rewards

### Experience
**Combat XP:** 4,100 XP (divided among party)

**Bonus XP:** +300 for killing the Alpha, +200 for discovering the collar's significance

### Treasure
| Item | Carried By | Value |
|------|------------|-------|
| Bronze Collar Tag | Alpha | Priceless (clue) |
| Winter Wolf Pelts | Dead wolves | 50 gp each |
| Mephit Ice Cores | Dead mephits | 10 gp each (alchemical) |

## DM Notes

### Running the Encounter

**Tone:** Predator and prey. The wolves are intelligent hunters; the party is meat that fights back.

**Key Theme:** The Northlands don't coddle travelers. Nature here is organized, patient, and lethal.

**Describing the Wolves:**
- They move like white shadows across the snow
- Eyes that track movement with unsettling focus
- No barking—silent communication through ear movements and pack position
- The Alpha's howl is *commanding*, not animalistic

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Make a fire | Wolves avoid the light; advantage on Perception to spot them |
| Climb trees | Wolves wait below; mephits harass |
| Cast Fireball | Pack scatters; Alpha retreats (they'll remember fire-users) |
| Attempt diplomacy | Alpha tilts head, then attacks anyway (these are predators) |
| Run | Wolves pursue; exhaustion becomes a factor |

### Telegraphing Danger
- Howls in the distance, growing closer over hours
- Tracks in the snow—many wolves, circling
- Local animals fleeing south
- The sudden silence of wilderness that knows predators are near

### Dramatic Moments
- The moment you realize the wolves are *coordinating*
- The Alpha's howl that makes its pack move as one
- Discovering the collar—this wasn't random nature
- A wolf pausing over a fallen party member, making eye contact with the Alpha before attacking

## Secrets

1. **The Lodge Connection:** The wolf pack was bred and trained at [[Frostfang Lodge]] by the winter wolf who claimed it. The Alpha obeys commands from the lodge.

2. **Territory Marking:** The pack's unusual intelligence allows them to identify valuable targets. They've been "paid" in meat to attack specific travelers.

3. **The Pack Bond:** If the Alpha is captured alive and the collar removed, it loses its enhanced intelligence over 1d4 days, becoming a normal (still dangerous) winter wolf.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Lodge:** The collar leads to [[Frostfang Lodge]]. Who trained these wolves? What else lurks there?

2. **Targeted Attack:** Someone paid the pack (through the Lodge) to attack the party specifically. Who? Why?

3. **The Pack Leader:** A winter wolf capable of commanding wolves might be reasoned with—if you could speak its language and offer something better than meat.
