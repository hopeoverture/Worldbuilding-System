# Voices in the Deep Wood

## Overview

Deep in [[The King's Wood]], the party receives an unprecedented message from [[Fernglow Warren]]—the hidden community of forest gnomes that officially doesn't exist. Something is wrong near the Old Palace ruins, and the gnomes need outside help. This encounter introduces the gnome community and sets up a larger mystery involving ancient evils stirring in the heart of the forest.

## Classification

### Difficulty
**Difficulty Level:** Easy (if handled diplomatically) to Moderate (if combat occurs)

**Party Level:** 3-5

**Party Size:** Any

### Encounter Type
**Encounter Style:** Exploration with puzzle/mystery elements

**Primary Skills:** Perception, Nature, Survival, Insight

**Objective:** Receive and understand the gnome's warning; potentially earn their trust

## The Approach

### Signs of the Unnatural

As the party travels through [[The King's Wood|the King's Wood]]'s Deep Wood section, they notice unsettling signs:

**Environmental Clues (DC varies):**
| Clue | Perception DC | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Silent Forest | 10 | No birdsong, no animal sounds—too quiet |
| Fleeing Wildlife | 12 | Animals moving away from something to the north |
| Disturbed Trees | 14 | Older trees seem to lean away from a direction |
| Strange Tracks | 15 | Bare humanoid footprints that stop suddenly |

**Nature Check (DC 13):** Something is frightening the forest's inhabitants. This isn't normal predator behavior—the entire ecosystem is disturbed.

### The Gnome's Approach

Once the party is deep enough (3+ miles from any road), they're being observed. [[Fernglow Warren]]'s scouts have been watching since they entered the forest.

**Perception DC 18:** A player spots small faces peering from behind mushroom clusters, then vanishing.

**Passive Perception 16:** The sensation of being watched, but nothing visible.

## The Message

### The Speaking Creatures

After the party has noticed the environmental wrongness, forest creatures begin behaving strangely:

**First Contact:**
A fox emerges from the underbrush and sits before the party. It tilts its head and speaks in a high, clear voice—obviously not its own: "You are not foresters. You are not hunters. What are you?"

**The Voice:** This is a gnome speaking through trained animal intermediaries using *speak with animals* and careful conditioning. The gnome (Pipwick Fernwhisper) is nearby but hidden.

**How to Respond:**
| Party Action | Result |
|--------------|--------|
| Answers honestly | Second creature arrives with more information |
| Attacks the fox | Fox flees; gnomes go silent; party lost for 1d4 hours |
| Tries to find the speaker | DC 18 Investigation; if found, gnome flees but is impressed |
| Speaks to the fox normally | Communication continues |

### The Warning

**Second Contact:**
A squirrel descends from a tree, speaking in the same voice: "Something stirs near the old human place. The stone palace that fell. The ground breathes wrong. The dead walk before death takes them."

**Third Contact:**
An owl lands on a branch overhead: "We cannot go there. We need walkers who are not small. Will you look? Will you tell us what wakes?"

**What the Gnomes Know:**
- Something is wrong near the Old Palace ruins (8 miles north)
- Animals refuse to enter a growing area around the palace
- The ground "breathes wrong"—strange sounds, unnatural vibrations
- Things move in the night that shouldn't move

**What They Want:**
- Someone to investigate the Old Palace
- Information about what's happening
- Protection if the threat spreads toward the Warren

## Earning Trust

### The Trust Challenge

**Objective:** Convince the gnomes that the party can be trusted with knowledge of their existence.

**Skill Challenge:** 4 Successes before 2 Failures

| Skill | DC | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Persuasion | 12 | Honest commitment to help |
| Nature | 13 | Understanding of forest ecology |
| History | 14 | Knowledge of forest gnome communities |
| Insight | 13 | Recognizing the gnome's fear is genuine |
| Animal Handling | 11 | Treating the messenger animals with respect |
| Performance | 12 | Gnomes appreciate a good story or song |

**Automatic Success Conditions:**
- Party includes a gnome: Automatic success and the speaker reveals themselves
- Party speaks Gnomish: +2 to all Charisma checks
- Party heals or helps a forest creature: One automatic success

**Failure Conditions:**
- Threatening the animals
- Dismissing the warning
- Demanding the gnomes reveal themselves

### Success: Pipwick Reveals Himself

**If the party earns trust:** A small figure emerges from behind a tree—Pipwick Fernwhisper, a forest gnome scout with bark-colored skin and moss-green hair.

**Pipwick's Offer:**
- Guide them partway to the Old Palace
- Provide a safe campsite in gnome-watched territory
- Share what the animals have reported
- Promise: "If you help us, we help you. The forest remembers its friends."

**What Pipwick Won't Do:**
- Reveal the Warren's location
- Go within 2 miles of the Old Palace
- Speak of the gnomes to anyone else

### Failure: Silent Departure

**If the party fails:** The speaking stops. The fox tilts its head, turns, and vanishes into the underbrush. For the next hour, the forest seems to close around them—paths become confusing, landmarks seem to move.

**Consequences:**
- The party can still find the Old Palace on their own
- They've lost a potential ally
- Future gnome encounters will be harder (DCs +2)

## Optional Combat

### The Corruption Scouts

**Trigger:** If the party travels toward the Old Palace, they encounter what the gnomes warned about.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | CR | XP | Quantity |
|----------|-----|-----|----------|
| Twig Blights | 1/8 | 25 | 6 |
| Vine Blight | 1/2 | 100 | 2 |
| Corrupted Deer (Zombie, reskinned) | 1/4 | 50 | 2 |

**Total XP:** 450 (adjusted for group: ~600)

**Description:**
These aren't normal blights—they're corrupted versions, their plant matter blackened and oozing. The deer were alive days ago; now they move with jerky, puppet-like motion.

**Tactics:**
- Twig blights ambush from underbrush
- Vine blights restrain targets for twig blight swarms
- Corrupted deer provide distraction

**Environmental Features:**
| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Dense Underbrush | Difficult terrain, twig blights ignore |
| Corrupted Ground | Creatures starting turn take 1 necrotic damage |
| Healthy Trees | Provide cover, will help fire-users (Nature DC 13) |

## Rewards

- The Old Palace ruins are the source of the disturbance
- Something ancient is stirring—connected to events from before human history
- The gnomes have watched this forest for generations; they know secrets

### Relationship: Fernglow Warren

**If Trust Earned:**
- Pipwick provides a carved wooden token (gnome friendship symbol)
- The party can request gnome assistance in the King's Wood
- Future information about Crown Lands events
- Safe camps in gnome-watched territory

**Token Benefit:** Showing the token to any forest creature summons gnome contact within 1d4 hours (King's Wood only).

### Material Rewards

| Item | Source | Value |

| Map of the Deep Wood | Pipwick | 25 gp value |

- Increase skill DCs by 2
- The gnomes are more desperate; the threat is more immediate
- Connection to [[The Ashen Fields]] curse becomes apparent

## DM Notes

### Running the Encounter

**Tone:** Mysterious and slightly unsettling. The gnomes are friendly but the forest itself is afraid.

**Key Theme:** Ancient evils don't respect modern boundaries. What humans have forgotten, the forest remembers.

**Roleplaying the Speaking Animals:**
- The voice is clearly not the animal's—higher, more articulate
- Animals still behave like animals between speeches
- The effect is intentionally uncanny

### Common Player Actions

| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Search for the Warren | They won't find it; gnomes ensure that |
| Follow animals back | Animals lead in circles, then vanish |
| Camp in the Deep Wood | Gnomes leave small gifts if trust was earned |
| Try to capture an animal | Animal dies before capture; gnomes go silent |

### Connecting to Larger Plot

The Old Palace disturbance connects to:
- [[The Ashen Fields]] curse (same dark source)
- [[The Mad King]]'s experiments (he knew of the palace)
- [[The Greenward]] bastion (druids tried to contain it)
- Whatever [[Prince Edric the Liberator]] "set free"

## Secrets

1. **The Deep Roots** beneath the Warren connect to tunnels running under all of [[The Crown Lands]]. Something is using those tunnels to spread.

2. **Elder Willowmist Fernglow** knows what was sealed in the Old Palace—knowledge passed down through 400 years of gnome elders. She's never told anyone.

3. **The Speaking** isn't just animal training—it's a form of ancient magic the gnomes have preserved since before humans came to Eldermyr.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Deep Roots:** Gnomes report movement in the sealed tunnels. They need someone to investigate without revealing the Warren.

2. **The Old Palace:** Whatever's stirring is getting stronger. The party has been asked to look—but what they find could change everything.

3. **Forest Intelligence:** Gnomes offer ongoing information about [[The Crown Lands]] in exchange for help with their crisis.
