# Lo Stretto d'Oro

## Overview
Lo Stretto d'Oro—the Golden Strait—is the narrow waterway that controls all sea trade entering [[The Western Shore]]. Whoever holds the Strait controls the wealth of Eldermyr's richest coast, and [[House Valdren]] has held it for centuries. The city of [[Porto Valdris]] sits at its narrowest point, collecting tolls from every ship that passes. This single geographic feature is the foundation of Valdren wealth and power.

## Geography

### Location
The Strait lies between the western coast of Eldermyr and a chain of rocky islands. It is the only deep-water passage into the sheltered waters of [[The Western Shore]], where [[Porto Valdris]], [[Marevento]], and [[Serenzia]] conduct their trade.

### Dimensions
- **Length:** Approximately 15 miles from open sea to inner waters
- **Width:** Varies from 3 miles at its widest to barely half a mile at the narrows
- **Depth:** Deep enough for the largest merchant vessels; treacherous shoals guard alternate routes

### The Narrows
The narrowest point, directly beneath [[Porto Valdris]], is fortified on both sides. Chain towers can close the passage entirely in times of war. No ship passes without Valdren permission.

## Strategic Importance

### Trade Control
Every merchant vessel entering [[The Trader's Sea]] to trade with the western ports must pass through the Strait. [[House Valdren]] charges tolls based on cargo value. These tolls fund the house's wealth and influence.

### Naval Chokepoint
In wartime, the Strait can be closed entirely. During [[The Great War]], [[House Valdren]] closed it against [[The Mad King]]'s forces, effectively blockading the crown's western trade and contributing significantly to the Alliance victory.

### Defensive Position
[[Porto Valdris]] is nearly impossible to attack from the sea. The narrow passage, combined with shore fortifications and the Valdren fleet, makes any naval assault suicidal.

## History

### Early Control
The Valdren ancestors recognized the Strait's value centuries ago and built their first fortress at the narrows. Every subsequent generation has reinforced this control.

### The War
During [[The Great War]], [[House Valdren]] used the Strait as their primary weapon. They didn't need to field large armies—controlling trade was enough leverage to secure their place in the Alliance.

### Present Day
[[Lord Varic Valdren]] uses the Strait as he uses everything—as a tool for negotiation. The threat of closing it keeps rival houses cooperative. The wealth it generates funds his regency.

## Economy

### Toll Revenue
The Strait generates enormous revenue for [[House Valdren]]:
- Fixed passage tolls for all vessels
- Percentage tolls on valuable cargoes
- Docking fees at [[Porto Valdris]]
- Pilot fees (navigation through the Strait requires licensed pilots)

### Trade Volume
Hundreds of ships pass through annually, carrying goods from across the known world. The Strait sees more trade than any other point in Eldermyr.

## Notable Features

### The Chain Towers
Massive towers on either side of the narrows can raise iron chains to block passage entirely. The chains have been raised only twice in history—both times during war.

### The Pilot Station
All vessels must take on licensed pilots to navigate the Strait's currents and hidden rocks. These pilots are well-paid and fiercely loyal to [[House Valdren]].

### The Lighthouse
The ancient lighthouse at the Strait's western entrance has guided ships for centuries. It is said to be blessed by the Shepherd.

**Prompt:**
> Lo Stretto d'Oro at midday, the narrow Golden Strait cutting between rocky coastlines that control all sea trade to the Western Shore. The famous narrows visible where the passage squeezes to barely half a mile, the fortress city of Porto Valdris rising dramatically on one side with chain towers on either shore ready to seal the passage. Merchant vessels queuing to pay their tolls, Valdren patrol galleys moving between them. The deep blue water catching the Mediterranean sun, whitecaps where currents clash in the narrow channel. Rocky islands of the Valdren chain visible beyond. Golden light reflecting off the gilded domes of Porto Valdris.

### The Narrows and Chain Towers
**Prompt:**
> The Narrows of Lo Stretto d'Oro at dusk, massive chain towers rising on either side of the passage. The towers are ancient stone fortifications bristling with catapults and ballistae, iron chains thick as tree trunks visible descending into the water—ready to rise and seal the strait against any fleet. Porto Valdris's walls climb the cliff behind the eastern tower, Valdren banners catching the sunset wind. A merchant cog passes through the gap, its captain negotiating with a toll boat. The water swirls with dangerous currents in the confined passage. The sense of absolute control—no ship passes without Valdren permission.
