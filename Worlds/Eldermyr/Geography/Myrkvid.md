# Myrkvid

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> Myrkvid is the ancient forest at the heart of the Northlands—dark, mysterious, and steeped in Old Ways magic. This is where the pre-Faith traditions remain strongest, where the veil between worlds grows thin, and where the land itself remembers. Use Norse/Celtic naming conventions. The tone should be mysterious and primordial, neither welcoming nor hostile—indifferent and ancient.

## Overview
Myrkvid sprawls across the heart of [[The Northlands]], a vast expanse of ancient evergreens that has never been fully mapped, never been tamed, and never acknowledged the authority of any human king. The Northfolk call it the Dark Wood not because it is evil, but because its canopy is so thick that twilight reigns even at noon, and because it holds memories older than human speech. Here the Old Ways are not a tolerated folk tradition—they are the law. The spirits of the land walk openly, the boundary between the living and dead grows thin, and those who enter without proper respect may find themselves walking paths that lead outside the world entirely.

## Classification

### Type
**Forest Type:** Boreal/Taiga (Old Growth) with temperate elements in southern reaches

### Age
**Forest Age:** Old Growth — Some trees are over a thousand years old; the forest itself has existed since before recorded history

### Character
**Atmosphere:** Mysterious / Enchanted — Neither welcoming nor hostile, but ancient and aware

### Scale
**Size:** Great Forest

**Approximate Area:** ~3,000 square miles; the largest unbroken forest in Eldermyr

## Physical Features

### Boundaries
| Direction | Border | Marker |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| North | [[The Greycrowns]] foothills | Where trees give way to stone |
| South | Crown Lands border | The Standing Stones (ancient boundary markers) |
| East | Thinning forest, farmland | The Last Trees (line of ancient oaks) |
| West | Gradual transition to hills | The Western Slopes |

### Terrain Within
**Elevation:** Rolling hills and shallow valleys; rises toward [[The Greycrowns]] in the north
**Ground Cover:** Thick carpet of needles and moss; fallen logs in various states of decay; occasional clearings
**Water Features:**
- Numerous streams feeding [[The Kingswater]]
- Hidden pools said to grant visions
- Bogs and marshes in low-lying areas

### Notable Areas
| Area | Character | Notable For |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| The Heart | Darkest, oldest part | Where the forest spirits are strongest |
| The Thornweald | Dense undergrowth | Natural barrier, dangerous to cross |
| Spirit's Grove | Unnaturally still | Old Ways sacred site; the veil is thinnest here |
| The Bone Glades | Dead trees standing | Ancient fire scar; said to be haunted |
| The Speaking Pools | Marshy lowland | Pools where ancestors' voices are heard |

### Edges & Borders
The forest's edges are clearly defined by ancient boundary markers—standing stones placed by the Northfolk's ancestors to mark where human law ends and the forest's law begins. Beyond these stones, the trees grow denser, the paths less reliable, and the Old Ways demand observance.

## Flora

### Dominant Trees
| Species | Prevalence | Characteristics |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Northern Pine | 40% | Tall, straight; primary timber tree |
| Dark Spruce | 30% | Dense needles; creates the distinctive darkness |
| Black Oak | 15% | Ancient specimens; sacred to Old Ways |
| Silver Birch | 10% | Found in clearings; bark used in rituals |
| Yew | 5% | Ancient, gnarled; associated with death and prophecy |

### Canopy
**Height:** 80-120 feet for mature conifers; black oaks can reach 150 feet
**Density:** Dense to Impenetrable in the Heart; moderate at edges
**Light Below:** Perpetual twilight in deep forest; dappled in outer regions

### Understory
Shrubs, smaller trees:
- Juniper thickets
- Holly (unusually prevalent; protective symbolism)
- Young conifers waiting for parent trees to fall
- Rowan (mountain ash) — sacred, planted near settlements

### Ground Layer
Ferns, fungi, mosses:
- Thick moss carpeting everything
- Shelf fungi on dead trees (some bioluminescent)
- Ferns in clearings and along streams
- Mushrooms of countless varieties (some edible, some deadly, some magical)

## Fauna

### Common Animals
| Animal | Prevalence | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Elk | Common | Large Northern variety; primary food source |
| Wolves | Common | Normal wolves (not dire); avoid humans who show respect |
| Black Bear | Common | Hibernate in winter; aggressive in spring |
| Boar | Moderate | Wild pigs; dangerous when cornered |
| Fox | Common | Silver and red varieties |

### Predators
- Wolf packs (coordinate but not supernaturally intelligent)
- Bears (territorial, especially females with cubs)
- Lynx (rare, solitary)
- [[Northland Dire Wolf]] (rare, only in deep forest)

### Rare Species
- **White Stag** — Appears to those on significant quests; sacred, never hunted

- Forest trolls (rare, found in deep caves)
- Will-o'-wisps (lead travelers astray)

### Magical Creatures
- **Forest Spirits (Vættir)** — Invisible entities that protect the forest; can manifest when angered or honored
- **The Wild Hunt** — Spectral hunters who ride through the forest on certain nights; to see them is dangerous
- **Ancestor Shades** — Spirits of the dead who never fully passed; some helpful, some lost
- **The Green Man** — Singular entity, may be the forest's consciousness; rarely seen, never ignored

## Climate & Seasons

### Climate
**Temperature Range:** Cold continental; -30°F in winter to 70°F in brief summer
**Precipitation:** Moderate rainfall, heavy snowfall; fog common year-round

### Seasonal Changes
**Spring:** Brief, muddy; dangerous as bears emerge; forest begins to wake
**Summer:** Three months of long days and short nights; the forest is least mysterious now
**Autumn:** The most sacred season; the veil thins; the Wild Hunt rides
**Winter:** Seven months of cold and darkness; the forest sleeps, but dreams

### Weather Patterns
Forest-specific weather:
- Mist that rises without natural cause
- Rain that falls only within the forest borders
- Sounds that carry strangely (or not at all)
- Unnaturally early darkness in deep areas

## Inhabitants

### Sentient Dwellers
| People | Population | Settlements |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| [[Elves\|Wood Elves]] | ~8,000 | Hidden settlements deep within |
| Northfolk | ~15,000 | Scattered villages and hamlets |
| [[The Spirit-Speakers]] | ~200 | Hidden lodge(s), location secret |
| [[Gnomes\|Forest Gnomes]] | ~500 | Small warrens near Wood Elf settlements |
| Hermits and holy folk | ~100 | Isolated throughout |

### Forest Communities
Villages, camps, enclaves:
- **Skógheim** — Largest forest settlement (~2,000); trading post at forest edge
- **Útgard** — Deep forest village; Old Ways practitioners only
- **Numerous small hamlets** — 10-50 people; follow the Old Ways exclusively
- **Logging camps** — Seasonal, at forest edges; follow strict protocols

### Wood Elf Settlements
The [[Elves|Wood Elves]] of Myrkvid dwell in hidden communities that predate human presence by millennia:

- **Silvaneth (The Starlight Glade)** — The largest Wood Elf settlement (~3,000), invisible to those who don't know the paths. Ruled by Elder Faelivrin, the elves here guard ancient knowledge about [[The Unnamed]] and maintain the wards that keep the darkest parts of the forest contained.
- **The Moon Pools** — A sacred settlement (~1,500) built around pools that reflect starlight even in daylight. This is where Wood Elf seers practice divination and where the Speaking Pools are maintained.
- **Scattered Groves** — Dozens of smaller communities (50-200 elves each) throughout the deep forest, each tending specific areas and maintaining the old magics.

Wood Elves share the Old Ways with the Northfolk humans but remember truths the humans have forgotten. They rarely interact with outsiders but will speak with [[The Spirit-Speakers]] and those who approach with proper respect. Since [[The Unnamed]] began stirring, the Wood Elves have grown more active—and more willing to consider alliances.

### Hermits & Recluses
Isolated inhabitants:
- Old Ways mystics seeking visions
- Outcasts from village justice
- [[The Spirit-Speakers]] candidates in training
- Allegedly, a changeling community deep in the forest

### Hostile Groups
Bandits, monsters, cults:
- **The Hungry** — Bandits who rejected the Old Ways; the forest is turning against them
- **Forest trolls** — Rare but deadly; found in deep caves
- **The Lost** — Travelers who entered without respect; they wander forever, becoming hostile

## Resources

### Timber
**Quality:** Excellent; Myrkvid pine is prized throughout Eldermyr
**Harvesting:** Strictly controlled by Northfolk clans; requires permission from village elders AND forest spirits (ritual offerings). Outsiders who cut trees without permission tend to suffer accidents.

### Hunting & Trapping
Game available:
- Elk (primary food source; hunted with ritual respect)
- Boar (dangerous but good meat)
- Fur-bearing animals (lucrative trade)
- Never: White Stag (sacred), wolves (kinship taboo), owls (ill luck)

### Foraging
| Resource | Season | Locations |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Mushrooms | Autumn | Throughout (requires expertise) |
| Berries | Summer | Clearings, edges |
| Medicinal herbs | Spring-Summer | Known gathering sites |
| Heartwood Moss | Year-round | Deep forest, old trees |

### Magical Resources
- **Ghostwood** — Wood from trees where someone died; holds memories
- **Prophet's Cap mushrooms** — Visionary fungus; [[The Spirit-Speakers]] monopoly
- **Spirit water** — Water from the Speaking Pools; enhances divination
- **Heart Tree sap** — From the sacred oaks; powerful but forbidden to take

### Restrictions
Who may harvest what?
- **Timber:** Northfolk clans with proper rituals only
- **Hunting:** Anyone who shows proper respect (offerings, prayers)
- **Magical resources:** [[The Spirit-Speakers]] and sanctioned practitioners only
- **Heart Tree products:** Absolutely forbidden; the forest itself enforces this

## Travel

### Paths & Roads
| Route | Condition | Safety |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| The Forest Road | Maintained | Safe (with respect) |
| Hunter's trails | Varies | Moderate |
| Spirit paths | Invisible | Dangerous for uninitiated |
| No path (deep forest) | — | Extremely dangerous |

### Landmarks
Navigation aids:
- **The Standing Stones** — Boundary markers; always visible from outside
- **The Bone Glades** — Visible for miles due to dead trees
- **Elder trees** — Distinctive ancient specimens that locals use for navigation
- **Star clearings** — Places where the canopy opens enough to see sky

### Travel Time
How long to cross?
- Edge to edge (Forest Road): 5-7 days
- To the Heart: 10+ days (if you can find it)
- Many travelers report the forest "stretching" — journeys take longer than they should

### Hazards
Dangers to travelers:
- Getting lost (the forest shifts for those without respect)
- Will-o'-wisps leading travelers astray
- Hostile wildlife (bears, boars, wolves in winter)
- Stumbling into sacred areas without proper preparation
- The Wild Hunt (certain nights in autumn)

### Guides
Who knows the forest?
- **Northfolk hunters** — Know the outer regions well
- **[[The Spirit-Speakers]]** — Know the deep forest; expensive and selective
- **Village elders** — Can teach proper rituals for safe passage
- **No outsider** should attempt the deep forest without a guide

## Notable Locations

### Clearings
Open spaces within:
- **Skógheim Market Clearing** — Trade gathering; neutral ground
- **Star clearings** — Natural openings; camping sites
- **The Bone Glades** — Fire scar; eerie but not evil

### Sacred Sites
Shrines, groves, holy places:
- **Spirit's Grove** — The most sacred Old Ways site; the veil is thinnest here
- **The Speaking Pools** — Where ancestors' voices can be heard
- **The Heart Trees** — Ancient oaks where the Green Man sometimes appears
- **Countless small shrines** — At significant trees, pools, and stones throughout

### Ruins
Ancient structures:
- **The Drowned Temple** — Pre-Faith structure in a marsh; purpose unknown
- **Útgard's Predecessor** — An older village abandoned for unknown reasons
- **The Stone Circle** — Within the Heart; older than human presence in Eldermyr

### Lairs
Monster dens, hideouts:
- **Troll caves** — Deep forest, underground; rarely approached
- **The Hungry's camp** — Somewhere in the Thornweald; constantly moving
- **Wolf dens** — Throughout; avoided out of kinship respect

### Mysterious Places
Unexplained locations:
- **The Heart** — The center of Myrkvid; finding it is a quest in itself
- **The Doors** — Trees that sometimes open to somewhere else
- **The Eternal Night** — Area where it's always dark, even at noon
- **The Path That Isn't** — A trail that only appears to those who need it

## History

### Origin
Myrkvid is older than human presence in Eldermyr. When the first Northfolk crossed [[The Greycrowns]] over a thousand years ago, the forest was already ancient, already aware, already inhabited by spirits. The early settlers learned—some the hard way—that this forest could not be conquered. Instead, they negotiated. The Old Ways began as the terms of that negotiation.

### Ancient History
What happened here long ago?
- **The First Compact** — Agreement between Northfolk and forest spirits
- **The Priest Wars** — When [[The Faith of the Three]] tried to convert the forest (failed)
- **The Burning** — An ancient fire created the Bone Glades; some say it was deliberate

### Major Events
| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| The Crossing | ~1,000+ years ago | Northfolk arrive; First Compact made |
| The Priest Wars | ~450 years ago | Faith tries to convert Northlands; forest resists |
| The Great Binding | ~400 years ago | [[The Spirit-Speakers]] formalized; peace achieved |
| The Last Burning | ~300 years ago | Final attempt to clear the forest; ended badly |

### Changes Over Time
The forest itself changes slowly if at all. What changes is human relationship to it. After the Priest Wars, the Crown and [[The Faith of the Three]] accepted that Myrkvid would not be tamed. The forest has grown slightly since then, reclaiming abandoned farmland at its edges—as if rewarding the Northfolk's protection.

## Magical Nature

### Enchantments
Magical properties:
- **The Stretching** — Distance is unreliable; the forest expands for those who don't belong
- **The Listening** — The forest is aware; it responds to intent
- **The Remembering** — Ghostwood trees record deaths; the forest doesn't forget

### Curses
Dark magic affecting the forest:
- **The Lost** — Those who enter with disrespect may never find their way out; they wander, slowly losing themselves
- **The Hungry's Doom** — Bandits who violated the Old Ways are slowly being consumed by the forest

### Fey Presence
Connection to other realms:
- **The Doors** — Some trees open to the Feywild (or somewhere else)
- **The Wild Hunt** — Rides through on autumn nights; their realm bleeds into the forest
- **Thinning veil** — At Spirit's Grove, the boundary between worlds is permeable

### Magical Effects
What happens to magic here?
- **Nature magic:** Enhanced; druids report spells lasting longer
- **Divine magic ([[The Faith of the Three]]):** Weakened; the forest doesn't recognize their gods
- **Necromancy:** Extremely dangerous; the forest's spirits react violently
- **Divination:** Enhanced near sacred sites; the forest wants to communicate

## Cultural Significance

### To Locals
How do nearby peoples view the forest?
- **Northfolk:** Sacred home; the source of their identity and traditions
- **Crown Lands folk:** Superstitious fear; wild stories of lost travelers
- **[[The Faith of the Three]]:** Embarrassing reminder of failed conversion; officially "tolerated paganism"
- **[[The Spirit-Speakers]]:** The heart of their tradition; their true temple

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- **Old Ways:** The forest IS sacred; it's where the spirits dwell, where ancestors linger
- **[[The Faith of the Three]]:** Officially considers the Old Ways "folk superstition"; unofficially, worried about Myrkvid
- **The Chronicler's Silence:** Some monks believe the forest is a natural memorial, respecting death in its own way

### In Folklore
Stories and legends:
- **The Green Man** — The forest's consciousness; helps those who show respect
- **The Wild Hunt** — Spectral hunters; seeing them means death within a year (unless you join)
- **The White Stag** — Appears to heroes on significant quests
- **The Lost** — Cautionary tales about those who disrespected the forest

### Names
What is the forest called and why?
- **Myrkvid** (Old Tongue) — "Dark Wood" or "Murky Wood"
- **The Black Forest** — Crown Lands name; reflects outsider fear
- **The Old Forest** — Northfolk respectful term
- **The Heart of the North** — Poetic name; recognizes its central importance

## Current Situation

### Territorial Control
Who claims the forest?
- **Officially:** The Crown of Eldermyr
- **Actually:** The Northfolk clans and the forest itself
- **[[The Spirit-Speakers]]:** Have authority over sacred sites
- **The forest spirits:** The true rulers; humans live here by permission

### Threats
Current dangers:
- **The Hungry** — Bandits becoming increasingly desperate as the forest turns against them
- **Logging pressure** — Crown merchants want more timber; Northfolk resist
- **The disturbance from [[The Ashen Fields]]** — The spirits are unsettled; something is wrong in the world

### Conflicts
Disputes over the forest:
- Crown vs. Northfolk over logging rights (ongoing)
- [[The Faith of the Three]] missionaries occasionally try again (always fail)
- [[The Spirit-Speakers]] vs. some village elders over degree of isolation

### Conservation
Efforts to protect or exploit:
- Northfolk clans fiercely protective
- [[The Spirit-Speakers]] act as guardians of sacred sites
- The forest protects itself; exploiters tend to have accidents

## Key Figures

### Forest Lords
Those who rule here:
- **Elder Yrsa Thornsdottir** — Most respected village elder; speaks for the Northfolk to outsiders
- **Völva Katla** — Senior [[The Spirit-Speakers|Spirit-Speaker]]; can negotiate with the forest itself
- **The Green Man** — If he exists, he is the true lord

### Notable Inhabitants
Famous residents:
- **Old Gorm** — Ancient hermit who has lived in the forest for sixty years; knows every path
- **The Thornweald Seven** — Outlaws who somehow survive despite violating the Old Ways
- **Sister Ingrid** — [[The Faith of the Three|Faith]] hermit who came to convert and instead converted to the Old Ways

### Legendary Figures
Historical connections:
- **First Elder Völund** — Made the First Compact with the forest spirits
- **The Burning Priest** — [[The Faith of the Three|Faith]] zealot who tried to burn Myrkvid; the forest consumed him
- **Queen Sigrid the Wise** — Ancient Northfolk queen who could speak to trees

## Secrets

1. **The Green Man is real, and he is troubled.** The disturbance from [[The Ashen Fields]] is affecting the entire realm's spiritual ecology. The boundary between life and death is weakening everywhere—including in Myrkvid. The Green Man has been seen more often in the past three months than in the previous century.

2. **The Doors are opening more frequently.** Whatever lies on the other side of the portal-trees is noticing Eldermyr. Creatures and beings not seen in centuries are slipping through. Not all are hostile, but none are predictable.

3. **[[The Spirit-Speakers]] know what [[The Blackened Crown]] truly is.** Their records go back further than [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith's]]. They know the crown wasn't created by [[The Mad King]]—he found it. It's far older, and it wasn't made by humans. They've been too afraid to tell anyone.

4. **Elder Yrsa is dying.** The most respected Northfolk leader has a wasting sickness no healer can cure. Her successor is her grandson, who is sympathetic to [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s overtures. If she dies before the succession crisis is resolved, the Northlands may side with the darkness.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Speaking Pools Fall Silent:** The ancestors have stopped answering. [[The Spirit-Speakers]] hire the party to investigate the Speaking Pools—and discover what's blocking communication with the dead throughout Eldermyr.

2. **The Hunt Rides Early:** The Wild Hunt has been seen in summer, months before its proper season. Something has disturbed the old patterns. The party must find out what before the Hunt starts claiming the living.

3. **The Green Man's Request:** An ancient, bark-covered figure appears to the party in a dream. The forest needs help. Will they answer, and can they survive the Heart of Myrkvid?

4. **The Door That Opened:** A village reports something came through one of the Door-trees—something that looks almost human but isn't. The party must track it before it reaches populated areas.

5. **Elder Yrsa's Last Mission:** The dying elder contacts the party secretly. She knows the truth about [[The Blackened Crown]] and needs someone outside Northfolk politics to act on it. But she won't trust anyone who doesn't first prove themselves worthy by entering the Heart.

6. **Silvaneth's Warning:** Elder Faelivrin of the [[Elves|Wood Elves]] has broken centuries of silence to request human aid. The wards containing the darkest parts of the forest are weakening, and the elves lack the numbers to reinforce them alone. She needs outsiders who can work magic the Old Ways don't recognize—and who can be trusted with secrets the elves have kept since before human memory.

7. **The Moon Pools' Prophecy:** The Wood Elf seers at the Moon Pools have seen something in their divinations—a vision of [[The Unnamed]] rising, and a weapon that could stop it. But the weapon requires a component that only grows in one place: the sealed heart of [[The Ashen Fields]]. The elves need human allies to retrieve it before the corruption spreads further.

### Forest Interior
**Prompt:**
> Deep within Myrkvid, the Dark Wood, ancient pine and spruce trees rising 100 feet to a canopy so thick only twilight reaches the forest floor. Thick moss covers everything—fallen logs, stones, the bases of trees. A shaft of pale light breaks through a gap in the canopy, illuminating swirling particles and a standing stone carved with Old Ways symbols. Mushrooms glow faintly on a dead tree. A white owl watches from a high branch. The atmosphere is mysterious and primordial, neither welcoming nor hostile—simply ancient and aware.

Fantasy ancient forest illustration.

### Forest Edge or Clearing
**Prompt:**
> The edge of Myrkvid at sunset, where ancient standing stones mark the boundary between human lands and the Dark Wood. Dense pine forest rises like a wall behind the stones, already dark though golden light still bathes the grassland before it. A Northfolk woman in traditional dress leaves an offering at one of the stones—bread, mead, and forest flowers. Ravens watch from the nearest trees. The forest seems to lean forward, listening. The scene conveys the boundary between worlds, the moment of entering somewhere Other.
