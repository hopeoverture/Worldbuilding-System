# Ostmark Pass

## Overview
Ostmark Pass is the only major route through [[The Ostmark Range]], the mountain wall separating Eldermyr from the lands beyond. For centuries, [[House Thorne]] has guarded this pass, and their fortress-city of [[Stahlburg]] commands its western approach. To hold the Pass is to hold the eastern border—and [[House Thorne]] has never let it fall.

## Geography

### Location
The Pass cuts through [[The Ostmark Range]] at its lowest point—which is still dauntingly high. It is located northeast of [[Stahlburg]], connected by a fortified road.

### Dimensions
- **Length:** Approximately 20 miles from western approach to eastern exit
- **Width:** Varies from a mile at its widest to barely 100 feet at the Gates
- **Elevation:** Rises to nearly 8,000 feet at the summit

### The Gates
The narrowest point, where the pass becomes a natural chokepoint between towering cliffs. Here, [[House Thorne]] built the Gate Fortress centuries ago, a position that has never been taken by assault.

## Strategic Importance

### The Only Way
There are other routes through the mountains—dangerous trails that claim lives every year—but Ostmark Pass is the only path that armies or trade caravans can use. Control the Pass, control access to Eldermyr from the east.

### Thorne's Purpose
[[House Thorne]] was granted [[The Eastern March]] specifically to guard this pass. Their entire identity is built around this duty. The fortress, the soldiers, the constant vigilance—all of it exists because of Ostmark Pass.

### Historical Sieges
The Pass has been attacked many times throughout history. Foreign powers, mountain clans, even rebellious lords have tried to force it. None have succeeded. The terrain, the fortress, and Thorne determination have held every time.

## Defenses

### The Gate Fortress
The primary fortification at the narrowest point. Walls stretch from cliff to cliff. Multiple levels of defense. Enough supplies stored for a year-long siege. Garrison of 500 veteran soldiers at all times.

### The Watch Towers
A series of signal towers along the pass, allowing instant communication from the eastern entrance to [[Stahlburg]]. If enemies approach, [[House Thorne]] knows within hours.

### The Murder Holes
The cliffs above the narrowest section are riddled with hidden positions. Archers and boulder-droppers can devastate any force attempting to push through.

### The Iron Gates
Massive iron-reinforced gates that can seal the pass entirely. They've been closed only three times in history—each time against major invasion.

## The Eastern Lands

### Beyond the Pass
What lies east of Ostmark Pass is another realm—or several. The lands beyond have changed rulers many times. Currently, a confederation of merchant-states maintains uneasy peace, more interested in trade than conquest.

### Trade
In peacetime, caravans pass through regularly, paying tolls to [[House Thorne]]. Eastern goods—spices, silk, exotic materials—enter Eldermyr through the Pass. Western goods flow the other way.

### Threats
The eastern lands occasionally produce threats: ambitious warlords, migrating peoples, religious movements. [[House Thorne]] watches, waits, and stands ready.

## Seasonal Considerations

### Winter
The Pass is often closed by snow from late autumn to early spring. Travel becomes impossible. [[House Thorne]] maintains the garrison year-round regardless.

### Summer
The brief campaign season when invasion is possible. [[House Thorne]] remains at highest alert during these months.

### The Thaw
The most dangerous time—melting snow causes floods and rockslides. Even the fortress has been damaged by spring avalanches.

### Pass Vista
**Prompt:**
> Ostmark Pass cutting through the formidable Ostmark Range, the only route wide enough for armies to cross. Sheer granite cliffs rising thousands of feet on either side, the pass narrowing dramatically toward the distant Gates. The fortified road winding up through switchbacks, watch towers visible at regular intervals along the climb. Snow on the peaks above even in summer, clouds catching on the high crags. The pass rising toward its summit at nearly 8,000 feet. A patrol of House Thorne soldiers visible on the road, their banners marking the realm's eastern border. The sense of strategic importance—whoever holds this pass holds Eldermyr's back door.

### The Gate Fortress
**Prompt:**
> The Gate Fortress at the narrowest point of Ostmark Pass, massive walls stretching from cliff to cliff across a gap barely 100 feet wide. The Iron Gates themselves are closed—enormous iron-reinforced doors that have sealed the pass only three times in history. Multiple levels of defense visible: murder holes in the cliffs above, arrow slits in the walls, catapults on the towers. House Thorne banners flying from the battlements. The road ends here for those without permission; beyond the gates, the eastern lands are visible as a hazy promise of the unknown. A merchant caravan waits at the gate, being inspected before passage is granted. The sense of impregnability—no army has ever forced these gates.
