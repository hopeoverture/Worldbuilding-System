# The Ash Road

## Overview
The Ash Road was once the main route connecting [[The Crown Lands]] to [[The Karath Reach]], a prosperous highway carrying grain north and goods south. Now it is abandoned south of [[Crossford]], a haunted path through increasingly blighted land where travelers are few and not all of them are alive. The road earned its name long before the curse—ash trees once lined its length—but now the name carries darker meaning.

## Geography

### Route
The Ash Road begins at [[Aldersgate]], runs south through [[Crossford]], and continues to [[Chernogrod]] and the southern coast. The total length is approximately 200 miles.

### Current State
- **[[Aldersgate]] to [[Crossford]]:** Still maintained and traveled, though traffic has declined
- **[[Crossford]] to [[Ravnograd]]:** Deteriorating, few travelers risk it
- **[[Ravnograd]] to [[Chernogrod]]:** Abandoned, overrun by the curse's effects

### The Abandoned Section
South of [[Crossford]], the road passes through increasingly blighted territory. Empty villages line the route. The ash trees that gave the road its name are dead. At night, travelers report seeing figures in the distance—soldiers who don't quite walk right.

## History

### Prosperity
For centuries, the Ash Road was the lifeblood of [[The Karath Reach]]. Grain wagons rolled north in endless procession. Merchants brought cloth, metal goods, and luxuries south. Inns and villages prospered.

### The War
During [[The Great War]], armies marched the Ash Road in both directions. [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] was fought near the road's southern terminus. The devastation began there.

### The Decline
After the war, trade resumed briefly, but as the curse spread, merchants stopped coming. Villages emptied. The road south of [[Crossford]] was officially abandoned ten years ago when the Crown acknowledged it could not maintain order there.

## Current Conditions

### The Safe Section
[[Aldersgate]] to [[Crossford]] remains passable, though traffic is a fraction of what it was. Crown patrols maintain some order. Merchants still travel, though they move quickly and don't linger.

### The Dangerous Section
[[Crossford]] to [[Ravnograd]] is risky but possible. No patrols, no maintained bridges, no guarantee of safety. Smugglers and the desperate use this route.

### The Cursed Section
[[Ravnograd]] to [[Chernogrod]] is not traveled by the living. The road passes too close to [[The Ashen Fields]]. Those who must reach [[Chernogrod]] go by sea, via [[The Bitter Coast]].

## Notable Locations Along the Route

### The Crossford Inn
The last safe stopping point, an ancient inn at [[Crossford]] where travelers gather before risking the southern road—or turning back.

### The Broken Bridge
A collapsed bridge over the Chorna tributary, forcing travelers to ford the river or turn back. It collapsed during the war and was never repaired.

### The Silent Villages
Dozens of abandoned settlements along the southern road, empty homes standing open, belongings still visible inside, no bodies but no explanation either.

### The Ash Grove Memorial
Once a beautiful grove of ash trees where travelers rested. Now the trees are dead, and travelers avoid it—locals say the dead gather there at night.

## Dangers

### The Risen
The further south, the more likely encounters with undead—wandering soldiers from [[The Great War]] who don't know they're dead.

### Bandits
Desperate people prey on the few travelers who risk the road. Some are merely criminal; others have been changed by proximity to the curse.

### The Blight
Extended exposure to the cursed lands causes sickness. Travelers who linger too long return... different.

### Karath Agents
[[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]]'s people watch the road. Not everyone who disappears falls to the curse.
