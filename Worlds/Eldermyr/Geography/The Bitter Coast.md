# The Bitter Coast

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Bitter Coast is the desolate, rocky southern shore of [[The Karath Reach]]—a place that was harsh even before the curse, now becoming actively hostile. Use Slavic/Eastern European naming conventions. The tone should be bleak, desolate, and increasingly horrific.

## Overview
The Bitter Coast stretches along the southern edge of [[The Karath Reach]], a hundred fifty miles of treacherous cliffs, black rocks, and unwelcoming shores that have claimed ships for as long as humans have sailed these waters. Even before [[The Great War]], this coast was sparsely settled—the rocks too jagged for good harbors, the land too poor for farming, the sea too rough for easy fishing. Now, with [[The Chorna]] emptying its cursed waters here and the blight spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]], the Bitter Coast has become something worse: a place where the sea itself seems sick, where drowned sailors don't stay dead, and where the few remaining inhabitants speak of lights beneath the waves that shouldn't exist.

## Classification

### Type
**Coast Type:** Rocky/Cliff (with scattered treacherous coves)

### Scale
**Length:** ~150 miles

**Adjacent Ocean/Sea:** Southern seas connecting to [[The Trader's Sea]]

### Location
**Continent:** Eldermyr
**Region:** [[The Karath Reach]]
**Direction Facing:** South

## Physical Features

### Shoreline
**Character:** Black volcanic rock cliffs interspersed with jagged boulder fields; minimal beaches
**Beach Type:** Rare shingle beaches in coves; black sand where present
**Cliff Height:** 50-200 feet in most areas; higher at the eastern end

### Coastal Features
| Feature | Location | Notable For |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| The Weeping Cliffs | Central coast | Water seeping through rock; looks like tears |
| The Jagged Teeth | Eastern end | Rock formations claiming dozens of ships |
| Gray Mouth | Where [[The Chorna]] empties | Poisoned estuary spreading corruption |
| Dead Man's Cove | Western coast | Only semi-safe harbor; grim name earned |

### Bays & Coves
| Name | Type | Uses |
|------|------|------|
| Dead Man's Cove | Protected cove | Last working fishing harbor |
| The Drowned Bay | Flooded valley | Ships avoid; something moves below |
| Widow's Inlet | Narrow inlet | Former fishing village; abandoned |
| The Gray Mouth | Estuary | [[The Chorna]]'s outlet; completely cursed |

### Headlands & Points
- **Blackstone Point** — Easternmost headland; lighthouse (abandoned)
- **Razor Cape** — Central prominence; navigation landmark; deadly in storms
- **Sorrow's End** — Western point; marks boundary with cleaner waters
- **The Fist** — Rocky promontory; looks like a raised fist; old shrine site

### Islands (Nearshore)
| Island | Distance | Character |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| The Condemned | 2 miles | Prison island; inmates left to die; now empty |
| The Broken Isles | 5-10 miles | Scattered rocks; shipwreck graveyard |
| Bone Island | 8 miles | White rock that looks like bone; birds avoid |

### River Mouths
Where rivers meet the sea:
- **Gray Mouth** — [[The Chorna]]'s estuary; the curse made visible; water stains the sea for miles
- **Dead Creek outlet** — Small stream; water gray; nothing lives in the tidal zone
- **The Weeping** — Underground river emerging through the Weeping Cliffs

### Reefs & Shoals
Underwater hazards:
- **The Jagged Teeth** — Rocks extending underwater; ship-killers
- **The Widow's Trap** — Hidden reef at inlet entrance; name explains why
- **The Gray Shallows** — Near the river mouth; water too shallow, too cursed
- **Countless unmarked rocks** — This coast is poorly charted; captains avoid it

## Tides & Waters

### Tidal Range
**High Tide:** +6 feet (moderate)
**Low Tide:** Exposes treacherous rock fields
**Spring Tides:** +8 feet; floods coastal caves

### Tidal Zones
What is exposed at low tide?
- Extensive boulder fields (navigation nightmare)
- The remains of wrecked ships (dozens visible)
- Things that were buried coming back up
- Near the Gray Mouth: gray mud that smells of death

### Currents
Nearshore water movement:
- Strong longshore current moving east to west
- Treacherous rip currents at cove entrances
- Near Gray Mouth: the current seems wrong, pulling toward the shore unnaturally

### Wave Action
**Normal:** Heavy; constant assault on the cliffs
**Storm:** Catastrophic; waves top 200-foot cliffs; spray reaches miles inland

### Water Temperature
**Summer:** 55-60°F (cold for southern waters)
**Winter:** 45-50°F (rarely freezes, but feels dead)
**Near Gray Mouth:** Unnaturally warm; the curse generates heat

## Climate

### Coastal Weather
**Prevailing Winds:** Southwesterly; drive waves against the coast constantly
**Sea Breezes:** Salt-laden; near Gray Mouth, carries a smell of rot

### Fog
**Frequency:** Common (worse near Gray Mouth)
**Season:** Year-round; heaviest in autumn
**Character:** The fog near the cursed areas is gray, not white, and clings unnaturally

### Storms
| Storm Type | Season | Severity |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Autumn gales | 8th-10th month | Severe; ships avoid the coast entirely |
| Winter storms | 11th-2nd month | Moderate; predictable |
| Gray Storms | Any | Unnatural; originate near Gray Mouth |

### Seasonal Changes
- Spring: Marginally calmer; fishing attempts resume
- Summer: Best weather (still harsh)
- Autumn: Dangerous; storm season
- Winter: Deadly; no traffic

## Ecology

### Intertidal Life
| Zone | Creatures | Plants |
|------|-----------|--------|
| High Tide | Formerly: crabs, snails / Now: little | Formerly: seaweed / Now: gray growth |
| Mid Tide | Formerly: mussels, anemones / Now: dying | Brown, dying algae |
| Low Tide | Formerly: diverse / Now: mostly dead | Nothing near Gray Mouth |

### Nearshore Fish
- **Western coast:** Some fish remain; populations declining
- **Central coast:** Fish dying; those caught taste wrong
- **Eastern/Gray Mouth:** Nothing alive; dead fish wash up

### Seabirds
- **Western:** Reduced populations; gulls, cormorants
- **Central:** Birds avoid; carrion eaters only
- **Eastern:** No birds; even carrion eaters won't land

### Marine Mammals
- Seals (formerly common; now rare; avoid cursed waters)
- Dolphins (never approach Gray Mouth; seem frightened)
- Whales (no longer migrate along this coast)

### Coastal Plants
- Surviving: Hardy grasses on cliff tops (western)
- Dying: Gray vegetation spreading from Gray Mouth
- Dead: Nothing grows near the cursed areas

### Dangerous Creatures
- **The Drowned** — Bodies of drowned sailors that rise again
- **Gray Crabs** — Mutated, aggressive, possibly venomous
- **Things in the Drowned Bay** — No one gets close enough to identify them

### Monsters
- **The Drowned Patrol** — Soldiers from [[The Great War]] who march underwater and onto beaches
- **Something at Gray Mouth** — Large, seen only as shadows; ships that anchor there vanish
- **The Bone Collectors** — Creatures on Bone Island; glimpsed but unidentified
- **Sea Wraiths** — Spirits of those who drowned in cursed waters; can't rest

## Settlements

### Ports
| Port | Size | Specialization |
|------|------|----------------|
| Dead Man's Cove | Tiny (~200) | Last fishing village; barely surviving |
| Abandoned ports | — | Multiple ruins along the coast |

### Fishing Villages
- **Dead Man's Cove** — The last one; population halved in 10 years; stubborn or trapped
- **Numerous ghost villages** — Names: Widow's Rest, Blackstone, Coastal Hope (ironic now)

### Coastal Towns
- None remain; the largest (Ravnograd's coastal district) was abandoned years ago

### Isolated Structures
Lighthouses, forts, hermitages:
- **Blackstone Lighthouse** — Abandoned; light hasn't shone in years; something lives there now
- **The Condemned** — Prison island; empty since guards stopped going
- **Coastal watchtowers** — Ruined; no one to watch, nothing to guard
- **The Hermit's Cave** — Supposedly holy man lives in a sea cave; or something pretending to be one

## Economy

### Fishing
**Methods:**
- Desperate small-boat ventures from Dead Man's Cove
- Quick in-and-out; never stay on water after dark

**Species:**
- Whatever can be caught quickly (declining)
- Fishers report catches are getting stranger

**Scale:** Subsistence only; no commercial value anymore

### Shipping
**Trade Goods:**
- None; ships avoid this coast

**Traffic:**
- Minimal; only desperate or lost vessels
- [[House Valdren]] shipping routes stay 50+ miles offshore

### Harvesting
Seaweed, shellfish, salt:
- Formerly: significant shellfish gathering
- Now: What's harvested near the curse is inedible or dangerous

### Other Industries
Shipbuilding, salvage, smuggling:
- **Salvage:** Desperate work recovering from the many wrecks; dangerous
- **Smuggling:** Some use the abandoned coves; [[House Karath]] doesn't care anymore
- **Corpse-recovery:** Grim trade; families pay to retrieve drowned relatives before they rise

## Navigation

### Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Danger Level |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| The Jagged Teeth | Eastern end | Extreme |
| Widow's Trap | Widow's Inlet | High |
| Gray Mouth currents | River outlet | Extreme (supernatural) |
| Unmarked rocks | Entire coast | High |
| The Drowned | Offshore waters | Supernatural |

### Aids to Navigation
Lighthouses, beacons, markers:
- **Blackstone Lighthouse** — Abandoned; the light is dark
- **No other aids** — Charts are incomplete; avoid this coast

### Safe Harbors
- **Dead Man's Cove** — "Safe" is relative; the only option
- **Sorrow's End** — Western point; marginally safer waters beyond

### Dangerous Stretches
- **The entire coast** — There are no safe stretches
- **Gray Mouth to Jagged Teeth** — Most dangerous 40 miles; supernatural hazards

### Shipwrecks
Known wrecks:
- **The Crown's Pride** — Royal vessel lost 50 years ago; visible at low tide
- **The Karath Fleet** — Multiple ships scuttled during [[The Great War]]
- **Countless others** — This coast collects ships like a graveyard

## Defense

### Natural Defenses
The coast's hostility IS its defense. No invading fleet would land here; the rocks would destroy them before any defenders needed to act.

### Fortifications
| Fort | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Coastal towers (ruined) | Various | Former watch posts; abandoned |
| The Condemned (prison) | Offshore island | Held prisoners; now empty |

### Watchtowers
- All abandoned; no one to man them, nothing worth watching

### Historical Invasions
- No army has ever attempted to land here
- During [[The Great War]], both sides ignored this coast as useless

## History

### Geological History
The Bitter Coast formed from ancient volcanic activity, leaving hard black rock that resists erosion but creates a jagged, ship-killing shoreline. The cliffs are relatively young geologically, still sharp and treacherous. The sea has been trying to wear them down for millennia with limited success.

### Settlement History
When were shores first settled?
- Ancient fishing communities; always marginal
- Never prosperous; the coast was always "bitter"
- Peak population perhaps 5,000 scattered along the shore
- Current population: under 500

### Maritime History
Famous voyages, battles, discoveries:
- **The Wreck of the Crown's Pride** — Royal ship lost with treasure; never recovered
- **The Scuttling** — [[House Karath]] sank their own fleet rather than surrender to rebels
- **The Last Lighthouse** — When Blackstone's light went dark, the coast was abandoned

### Major Events
| Event | Era | Impact |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Original settlement | 500+ years ago | Marginal fishing communities |
| The Scuttling | 23 years ago | [[House Karath]] destroys own fleet |
| [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] | 23 years ago | Curse begins affecting coast |
| Blackstone abandonment | 15 years ago | Last lighthouse goes dark |
| The Gray Spreading | 5 years ago | Visible curse reaches sea |

### Shipwrecks
Notable maritime disasters:
- **The Crown's Pride** — Royal ship; treasure aboard; cursed now
- **The Karath Fleet** — Scuttled warships; crews went down with them; they still man their posts
- **The Mercy** — Hospital ship that tried to evacuate wounded; hit rocks; all lost

## Cultural Significance

### To Coastal Peoples
The few who remain are bound by stubbornness, poverty, or darker ties. They call themselves "the Forsaken" and have developed a grim fatalism. The sea is not provider here—it is executioner. You take what you can before it takes you.

### Traditions
Coastal customs:
- **The Naming of the Drowned** — Reciting names of the lost before setting sail
- **The Anchor Chain** — Wearing iron chain links for protection against the risen
- **Never speak of what you see** — Acknowledging horrors gives them power
- **Three stones on the grave** — Ensuring the dead stay buried

### Religion
Sea deities and beliefs:
- **[[The Faith of the Three]] is abandoned** — The gods don't answer here
- **The Drowned Mother** — Local cult worshipping something in the deep
- **The Chronicler's Failure** — The dead don't rest; faith is broken

### Legends
Stories about this coast:
- **The Ships That Sail Themselves** — Wrecked vessels seen moving at night
- **The Drowned King** — A Karath lord who went down with his fleet; leads the underwater dead
- **The Hermit's Bargain** — The holy man in the cave traded his soul to survive
- **The Lights Below** — Something shines beneath the water at Gray Mouth; never investigate

## Dangers

### Natural Hazards
| Hazard | Frequency | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Storms | High (autumn) | Extreme |
| Erosion | Constant | High (cliffs collapsing) |
| Fog | Common | High (navigation impossible) |
| Rogue waves | Unpredictable | Extreme (sweep people from cliffs) |

### Pirates & Raiders
- None—even pirates won't come here
- [[House Karath]] is too broken to raid anything

### Monsters
- **The Drowned** — Risen dead from shipwrecks; patrol the waters
- **The Scuttled Fleet's Crew** — Karath sailors still at their posts, underwater
- **Whatever lives at Gray Mouth** — Large, hungry, supernatural
- **Sea Wraiths** — Spirits that can't move on; drawn to the living

### Smugglers
- Some use the abandoned coves; risky but unwatched
- They don't go east of Dead Man's Cove anymore

## Notable Locations

### Landmarks
- **Razor Cape** — Navigation landmark; identifiable profile
- **The Fist** — Promontory shaped like a raised fist
- **The Weeping Cliffs** — Where groundwater seeps through; constant "tears"
- **Gray Mouth** — Where [[The Chorna]] meets the sea; visible discoloration

### Sacred Sites
- **The Fist Shrine** — Pre-Faith site on the promontory; offerings still left
- **The Hermit's Cave** — Either holy man or monster; pilgrims risk finding out
- **The Underwater Shrine** — Visible at extreme low tide; no one approaches

### Ruins
- **Blackstone Lighthouse** — Abandoned; something moved in
- **The Coastal Villages** — Widow's Rest, Coastal Hope, others; ghost towns
- **The Condemned** — Prison island; crumbling
- **Watchtowers** — Scattered ruins along the cliffs

### Adventure Sites
Caves, wrecks, hidden coves:
- **The Crown's Pride wreck** — Treasure aboard; guarded by the risen crew
- **The Scuttled Fleet** — Karath warships on the seabed; their crews still serve
- **Blackstone Lighthouse** — What took it over?
- **The Drowned Bay** — An entire flooded valley; something LARGE below
- **The Hermit's Cave** — Is he a saint or something wearing a saint's face?

## Current Situation

### Territorial Control
Who claims this coast?
- **[[House Karath]]** — Nominal claim; no enforcement
- **Actually:** The sea, the dead, and whatever feeds on both

### Conflicts
Current disputes:
- None—no one wants this coast
- [[House Karath]] has bigger problems

### Threats
Dangers facing the coast:
- The curse spreading along the shoreline
- Dead Man's Cove may become unlivable soon
- Whatever is at Gray Mouth is getting bolder
- The Drowned are seen closer to shore each year

### Development
Changes being made:
- None positive
- The curse develops; the coast dies
- [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s activities may be affecting coastal conditions

## Key Figures

### Coastal Lords
- **[[Lord Draven Karath]]** — Technical lord; never visits
- **No actual authority** — The coast is ungoverned

### Harbor Masters
- **Old Yuri** — Dead Man's Cove; more concerned with survival than administration
- **No others remain**

### Famous Sailors
- **Captain Volkov** — Died getting refugees out; considered a saint by survivors
- **Black Serena** — Pirate who operates out of western coves; still alive somehow

### Legendary Figures
- **The Drowned King** — Karath lord who commands the underwater dead
- **The Hermit** — Holy man or monster in the sea cave
- **The Lighthouse Keeper's Ghost** — Supposedly still tends Blackstone's light; it never shines

## Secrets

1. **The Hermit is both.** He was a holy man who made a bargain to survive. The thing wearing his face still dispenses wisdom and healing—for a price. Those who visit leave changed. Some don't leave at all.

2. **The Scuttled Fleet is an army.** [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s ancestors went down with their ships deliberately, making a pact with something in the deep. They await a signal to rise. [[Lord Draven Karath]] has been trying to find how to give that signal.

3. **Gray Mouth connects to [[The Ashen Fields]] underwater.** The curse isn't just spreading through the river—there's a subterranean connection. Something is moving between the Fields and the sea through flooded tunnels. The corruption is bidirectional.

4. **There are survivors on The Condemned.** The prison wasn't fully evacuated. Inmates were left to die. They didn't die—but they didn't stay human either. They've been there for fifteen years, becoming something else.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Crown's Treasure:** A map surfaces showing the exact location of the Crown's Pride's cargo hold. The treasure could fund an army—or end a war. But the wreck is guarded, and the risen crew still takes their duty seriously.

2. **The Hermit's Cure:** Word spreads that the Hermit of the Bitter Coast can heal any ailment—even curse-sickness. A desperate noble's child needs saving. The party must find the cave, survive the Hermit's test, and pay his price.

3. **The Prison Break:** Intelligence suggests something important is hidden on The Condemned—or someone. The party must reach the prison island and deal with whatever the inmates have become.

4. **The Signal:** [[Lord Draven Karath]] hires the party to find something on the seabed—a device that will let him command the Scuttled Fleet. He doesn't explain what it does. Do they help him, or stop him?

5. **Gray Mouth Investigation:** [[House Valdren]] wants to know if the coastal corruption threatens their shipping lanes. The party must investigate Gray Mouth up close and discover the underwater tunnels—and what uses them.

### Coastal Vista
**Prompt:**
> The Bitter Coast at twilight, black volcanic cliffs rising 150 feet from a churning gray sea. Jagged rocks extend into the water like broken teeth. Waves crash against the shore, throwing spray high against the cliff faces. In the distance, the abandoned Blackstone Lighthouse stands dark against a stormy sky. A wrecked ship is visible on the rocks, half-submerged. No birds fly. The water near the shore has an unhealthy gray tinge. Fog creeps in from the sea. The scene conveys desolation, danger, and supernatural wrongness.

Fantasy cursed coast illustration.

### Coastal Settlement
**Prompt:**
> Dead Man's Cove, the last fishing village on the Bitter Coast. A handful of weather-beaten cottages cling to a cliff above a tiny protected harbor where three small boats are moored. Nets hang drying, but they look poorly maintained. The villagers visible are gaunt and wary. Gray water laps at the stone quay. On the cliff above, an iron chain hangs from a post—a warning bell for when the Drowned come. Storm clouds gather on the horizon. The scene shows desperate survival at the edge of the cursed zone.

- No one sane chooses to be here
- The supernatural horror should be implicit—glimpsed, not displayed
- This coast connects to the broader curse spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]]
- The underwater elements (Scuttled Fleet, tunnels) are major secrets
