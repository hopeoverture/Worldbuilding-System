# The Chorna

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Chorna is the dying river of [[The Karath Reach]]—once a life-giving waterway, now running gray with the curse from [[The Ashen Fields]]. Use Slavic/Eastern European naming conventions. The tone should be bleak, mourning, and increasingly horrific as one travels downstream toward the curse.

## Overview
The Chorna once watered the most fertile farmland in southern Eldermyr, a broad, slow river that made [[The Karath Reach]] the breadbasket it was before [[The Great War]]. Now it runs gray. The water near [[The Ashen Fields]] has turned the color of ash, fish float belly-up along its banks, and those who drink from it downstream sicken and die. The Karath folk call it the Dying River, and they are not wrong—the Chorna is being poisoned by whatever curse animates the dead in the Fields, and the blight spreads a little further upstream each month.

## Classification

### Type
**River Type:** River (formerly major; now diminished)

### Scale
**Length:** ~180 miles from source to sea
**Width:** 80-150 feet (upper), 200-300 feet (middle), variable at mouth
**Depth:** 4-10 feet (upper), 8-15 feet (middle), shallow and silted at mouth

### Character
**Flow:** Slow (sluggish near the curse; the river seems reluctant to move)
**Water:** Gray near [[The Ashen Fields]], brackish-brown elsewhere; formerly clear

## Course

### Source
**Location:** The foothills where [[The Eastern March]] meets [[The Karath Reach]]
**Type:** Springs and highland streams
**Description:** The Chorna begins clean in the eastern hills, fed by springs that still run pure—for now. The headwaters are the last healthy part of the river, though even here farmers report the water tastes wrong, and fewer fish spawn each year. Old Karathi say the springs weep for what their waters will become.

### Upper Course
**Character:** Clean but nervous; farmers watch for signs of corruption
**Terrain Passed:** Eastern foothills, upper farmland (still cultivated)
**Notable Features:**
- **The Last Mills** — Water mills still operating; how long until the curse reaches them?
- **Starovod (Old Waters)** — Village where the river is still drinkable
- **The Weir** — Ancient dam controlling flow; if it breaks, the curse spreads faster

### Middle Course
**Character:** Increasingly gray; fish dying; farms abandoned
**Terrain Passed:** Central [[The Karath Reach]]; once the richest farmland
**Notable Features:**
- **[[Chernogrod]]** — The Black City sits where the river is still marginally usable
- **The Gray Stretch** — 30 miles where the water is visibly discolored
- **Dead orchards** — Fruit trees along the banks died years ago

### Lower Course
**Character:** Fully corrupted; the curse made visible
**Terrain Passed:** [[The Ashen Fields]] and beyond to [[The Bitter Coast]]
**Notable Features:**
- **The Ash Confluence** — Where water draining [[The Ashen Fields]] joins the main river
- **The Dead Stretch** — Nothing lives in or near the water
- **The Broken Bridge** — The Ash Road's bridge collapsed; the river ate the supports

### Mouth
**Location:** [[The Bitter Coast]], southern sea
**Type:** Polluted estuary
**Description:** The Chorna empties into the sea through a gray, lifeless estuary. The water stains the ocean for miles. Fish avoid the area. Coastal villages have been abandoned. Sailors report the sea itself seems sick where the river meets it—and the corruption is spreading along the coast.

### Tributaries
| Tributary | Joins At | Size | Notable For |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| Ashen runoff | Middle course | Small | THE source of corruption; drains the Fields |
| Dead Creek | Lower course | Formerly moderate | Completely lifeless; name prophetic |
| The Pepel | Near [[Chernogrod]] | Small | Runs through old battlefields; gray for decades |
| Eastern streams | Upper course | Several small | Still clean; for now |

## Physical Features

### Rapids & Falls
| Name | Location | Height/Class |
|------|----------|--------------|
| The Weir falls | Upper course | 15 feet (artificial) |
| Chernogrod rapids | At the city | Class II (navigable) |
| None below | Lower course | The river is too sluggish to form rapids |

### Islands
River islands:
- **Mertvy Ostrov (Dead Island)** — In the lower course; vegetation died; birds won't land
- **Chernogrod Isle** — At the city; still inhabited; increasingly anxious
- **The Bone Bar** — Sandbar of accumulated... material... near the Ash Confluence

### Fords & Shallows
Natural crossing points:
- **The Old Ford** — Upper course; still used; water only knee-deep
- **The Ash Ford** — Middle course; abandoned; those who crossed sickened
- **Lower crossings impossible** — The curse makes contact dangerous

### Deep Pools
- **The Black Pool** — Below [[Chernogrod]]; unnaturally deep; something may live there
- **The Drowned Village** — A flooded settlement in the lower course; the dead still walk underwater
- **Mrtvoe Pool** — "Dead Pool"; nothing lives; water is oily and wrong

### Floodplains
Areas that flood:
- The entire middle course was floodplain before the war
- Flooding still occurs but leaves gray residue
- Former farmland is now dead earth
- The Fens of Sorrow — Lower course marshland; completely corrupted

### Deltas/Wetlands
- **The Fens of Sorrow** — Once productive wetland; now cursed marsh; the dead walk here
- **The Gray Mouth** — Estuary where river meets sea; spreading contamination

## Hydrology

### Flow Rate
**Volume:** Approximately 3,000 cubic feet per second (reduced from historical 5,000+)
**Seasonal Variation:** Less than before; the river seems disconnected from natural cycles

### Flooding
**Flood Season:** Spring (theoretically)
**Severity:** Reduced; the curse seems to suppress natural flooding
**Historical Floods:**
- The Mourning Flood (30 years ago) — Last major flood before the war
- Post-war: Flooding has been eerily minimal; unnatural

### Droughts
Low water periods:
- The river is lower than it should be year-round
- Less snowmelt reaching it; less rain falling in the cursed zone
- Some tributaries have dried up entirely

### Water Quality
- **Upper course:** Drinkable but tastes slightly off; fish populations declining
- **Middle course:** Dangerous; short-term exposure causes nausea; long-term causes wasting
- **Lower course:** Deadly; even touching the water causes curse-sickness; drinking is fatal

## Navigation

### Navigability
**Navigable Sections:** Source to [[Chernogrod]] only (~100 miles); below that, no one dares
**Boat Types:** Flat-bottomed boats (traditionally); now only desperate fishermen
**Obstacles:**
- The Weir (portage required)
- Gray water (pilots refuse to enter)
- The Broken Bridge debris (lower course; impassable anyway)

### Ports & Landings
| Port | Location | Size | Trade |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| Chernogrod Harbor | [[Chernogrod]] | Medium | Last active port; declining |
| Starovod Landing | Upper course | Small | Local goods; still functioning |
| Abandoned wharves | Middle/lower | — | Rotting; unused |

### River Traffic
What travels the river?
- **Upstream:** Almost nothing now; no trade from the coast
- **Downstream:** Timber, desperate refugees
- **Local:** Fishing boats in upper reaches
- **What shouldn't travel:** Things are seen floating downstream that aren't logs

### Crossings
| Crossing | Type | Location | Controller |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| The Stone Bridge | Bridge | [[Chernogrod]] | [[House Karath]] |
| The Old Ford | Ford | Upper course | Local village |
| The Broken Bridge | Ruins | Lower course | None (collapsed) |
| Ferry crossings | Abandoned | Multiple | None |

## Settlements

### Major Cities
Cities on the river:
- **[[Chernogrod]]** — The Black City; 35,000; last major settlement; upstream of worst corruption

### Towns
- **Starovod** — Upper course; ~2,000; clinging to existence
- **Ravnograd** (upriver part) — ~8,000; connected to river; increasingly abandoned

### River Communities
Villages dependent on the river:
- Dozens of fishing villages—most abandoned
- A few stubborn communities in the upper reaches
- Ghost villages line the middle and lower course

## Economy

### Trade Route
The Chorna was once a vital trade route connecting [[The Karath Reach]] to the sea. Grain floated downstream to coastal markets; goods came upstream from foreign lands. Now the river carries only death. The few goods that move do so overland at great expense. The economic collapse of the region is partly the war's legacy, partly the river's curse.

### Goods Transported
| Good | Direction | Volume |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Timber | Downstream | Low (desperate sales) |
| Nothing | Upstream | Trade has collapsed |
| Bodies | Downstream | Grim reality; the dead float toward the sea |

### Fishing
**Species:**
- Formerly: carp, pike, sturgeon (famous Chorna caviar)
- Now: Nothing below [[Chernogrod]]; declining populations above

**Industry:** Destroyed. Fishing families have fled or starved. The famous Chorna caviar is a memory.

### Other Industries
Mills, irrigation, mining:
- **Mills** — The Last Mills still operate upstream; their days are numbered
- **Irrigation** — Abandoned; cursed water kills crops
- **The river's only industry now is death**

### Tolls & Tariffs
Who collects payment for river use?
- [[House Karath]] technically controls the river
- No one bothers collecting tolls; there's nothing to tax
- Smugglers use the upper reaches; no one patrols

## Ecology

### Fish & Aquatic Life
| Species | Abundance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Carp | Declining (upper only) | Tastes wrong; some won't eat it |
| Pike | Rare (upper only) | Aggressive; attacks unusual |
| Sturgeon | Extinct | The famous caviar is gone |
| Everything below Chernogrod | Dead | Nothing survives the gray water |

### Riverside Flora
- Upper course: Willows and reeds survive; showing stress
- Middle course: Dead trees line the banks; gray vegetation
- Lower course: Nothing grows; the earth itself seems poisoned

### Wildlife
Animals dependent on the river:
- Upper: Reduced populations; animals avoid the water
- Middle: Carrion birds (feast on dead fish); nothing else
- Lower: Nothing natural; only the risen dead

### Monsters
Dangerous river creatures:
- **Bog-dead** — Risen corpses in the lower marshes; waterlogged and horrible
- **The Gray Eels** — Mutated eels in the middle course; toxic bite
- **Something in the Black Pool** — Locals won't discuss it
- **The Drowned Patrol** — Soldiers who drowned during [[The Great War]]; still march underwater

## Political Significance

### As a Boundary
The Chorna marks the heart of [[The Karath Reach]], but it's becoming a boundary of a different sort—between the living and the dead. Above [[Chernogrod]], life continues. Below it, the curse holds sway. The river that once united the region now divides the survivable from the doomed.

### Territorial Control
Who controls the river?
| Section | Controller | Rights |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Upper course | [[House Karath]] | Nominal authority; locals govern themselves |
| [[Chernogrod]] | [[House Karath]] | Direct control |
| Middle course | No one | Abandoned |
| Lower course | The curse | [[House Karath]] claims it; reality disagrees |

### Disputes
River-related conflicts:
- No external disputes; no one wants this river
- Internal: Should [[Chernogrod]] evacuate before the curse reaches them?
- [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s secret: He's using the curse, not fighting it

### Treaties
Agreements about river use:
- Historical: The Chorna Compact guaranteed fishing rights
- Now: Meaningless; there's nothing to fish

## Cultural Significance

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- **[[The Faith of the Three]]:** The dying river is seen as divine punishment or warning
- **Old Karathi traditions:** The river was sacred; its death is a spiritual catastrophe
- **The Ash Penitents:** Believe the curse is deserved; perform rituals at the gray water

### In Folklore
Stories and legends:
- **Mother Chorna** — The river's spirit; weeping for her murdered children
- **The Gray Fisherman** — Ghost who appears to those about to drown
- **The Drowned Army** — Soldiers who sank during [[The Great War]]; still fighting beneath the water
- **The Healing Waters** — Legend of a spring that can cleanse the curse; desperately sought

### Traditions
River-related customs:
- **The Mourning** — Annual ceremony lamenting the river's death
- **The Last Catch** — When a fishing village dies, they catch and eat the last fish together
- **Don't drink downstream** — Not tradition; survival

### Names
What is the river called by different peoples?
- **The Chorna** — "Black" in Old Karathi; named for the dark earth it ran through
- **The Dying River** — Current common name
- **The Gray Waters** — What it's becoming
- **Chorna Reka** — Full Old Karathi name

## History

### Geological History
The Chorna carved its valley over millions of years, creating the rich alluvial soils that made [[The Karath Reach]] so fertile. The river's slow, meandering course deposited nutrients across a broad floodplain. What took nature eons to build, the curse is destroying in decades.

### Historical Importance
Role in history:
- The river made Karath agriculture possible
- [[Chernogrod]] was founded at the best crossing point
- Trade along the Chorna funded Karath power
- [[The Great War]] was fought partly over control of this resource

### Major Events
| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Karath settlement | 600 years ago | River becomes agricultural lifeline |
| Height of prosperity | 100 years ago | Chorna caviar famous throughout the realm |
| [[The Great War]] | 23 years ago | Battles pollute river; bodies choke the current |
| [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] | 23 years ago | Curse begins; river starts dying |
| The Gray Reaches | 10 years ago | First noticeable discoloration downstream |
| The Dead Stretch | 3 years ago | Lower course becomes completely lifeless |

### Legendary Events
Mythical happenings:
- **The River's Gift** — Legend says the Chorna gave the first Karath lord a crown of silver fish
- **The Weeping** — Mother Chorna cried for seven days when [[The Mad King]] died; created a flood
- **The Promise** — The river will run clear again when the curse is lifted

## Notable Locations

### Along the Banks
| Location | Bank | Notable For |
|----------|------|-------------|
| [[Chernogrod]] | Both | Last major city; increasingly desperate |
| The Ash Confluence | East | Where the curse enters the main river |
| The Broken Bridge | Both | Collapsed crossing; marks where travel ends |
| Starovod | West | Last healthy fishing village |

### On the River
Islands, rocks, hazards:
- **Mertvy Ostrov** — Dead Island; nothing lives; birds avoid
- **The Bone Bar** — Accumulation of remains at the confluence
- **The Drowned Village** — Underwater settlement; the dead still move there
- **Chernogrod Isle** — Still inhabited; increasingly anxious

### Sacred Sites
- **The Weeping Stone** — Where Mother Chorna supposedly cried; pilgrimage site
- **The Old Shrine** — Pre-Faith water shrine; underwater now
- **The Mourning Glade** — Where the Mourning ceremony is held

### Ruins
- **The Broken Bridge** — Ash Road crossing; collapsed
- **Abandoned mills** — Throughout the middle course
- **Ghost villages** — Dozens; their inhabitants fled or died
- **The Drowned Village** — Flooded settlement visible in clear water... if you dare look

## Current Situation

### Health
Environmental condition:
- Upper course: Stressed but survivable
- Middle course: Dying; contamination spreading upstream
- Lower course: Dead; the water is poison
- The curse advances ~1 mile upstream per year; accelerating

### Threats
Current dangers:
- The curse is spreading faster than before ([[High King Aldric II]]'s death accelerated something)
- [[Chernogrod]] may become uninhabitable within 5 years
- The corruption is reaching [[The Kingswater]] system via groundwater
- [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s activities may be making it worse

### Development
Changes being made:
- None positive; the river is dying
- [[Lord Draven Karath]] is doing something at the Ash Confluence; no one knows what
- Some talk of damming the river to stop the curse spread; would flood Chernogrod

## Key Figures

### River Lords
Those who control sections:
- **[[Lord Draven Karath]]** — Technically controls the river; actually bargaining with its curse
- **No one else** — The river lords are dead or fled

### River Folk
Famous inhabitants:
- **Old Miroslav** — Last fisherman working the middle course; says the Gray Fisherman talks to him
- **The Weeping Woman** — Lives by the Mourning Stone; either mad or holy
- **The Toll-taker** — Bandit who extorts what little traffic remains

### Legendary Figures
- **Mother Chorna** — River spirit; weeping
- **The First Fisher** — Legendary Karath ancestor who received the river's gift
- **The Gray Fisherman** — Ghost who appears before drowning

## Secrets

1. **[[Lord Draven Karath]] is feeding the curse.** At the Ash Confluence, in secret rituals, he offers sacrifices to accelerate the corruption—in exchange for control over what rises from the dead. The river's worsening is partially his doing.

2. **The Drowned Village contains survivors.** Not alive, not exactly dead—people who drowned but didn't rise as undead. They exist in a state between, preserved by the curse but aware. They want rescue. They want death. They don't know which.

3. **The curse is spreading through groundwater.** The contamination has reached aquifers that feed [[The Kingswater]]. In months, the great river will begin showing signs. In years, [[Aldersgate]]'s water supply will be poisoned.

4. **The healing waters exist.** A spring in the upper Chorna valley runs pure—actively pure, resisting the curse. [[The Faith of the Three]] doesn't know why. [[The Spirit-Speakers]] do: it's a place where the Chronicler's power is still strong. It could cleanse the curse—if it could be carried to [[The Ashen Fields]].

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Upstream Limit:** The party is hired to mark exactly how far the curse has spread. But something in the gray water doesn't want them measuring—and the curse is spreading faster than the maps show.

2. **The Drowned Village:** Visions lead the party to the flooded settlement where preserved victims beg for release. Freeing them requires entering the cursed water—and confronting whatever guards them.

3. **The Healing Spring:** [[The Spirit-Speakers]] reveal the existence of the healing waters. The party must travel through increasingly cursed territory to reach the spring—and then carry its water through [[The Ashen Fields]] to the source of corruption.

4. **Draven's Ritual:** Evidence surfaces that [[Lord Draven Karath]] is deliberately worsening the curse. The party must reach the Ash Confluence and witness—or stop—what he's doing there.

5. **The Last Fish:** A dying fisherman's final request: catch him one more Chorna sturgeon. The legendary fish were thought extinct. But something still swims in the Black Pool—and it's not a fish anymore.

### River Vista
**Prompt:**
> The Chorna River flowing through the blighted Karath Reach, water an unnatural gray color reflecting an overcast sky. Dead trees line both banks, their bare branches reaching over the sluggish current. Abandoned farmland stretches beyond, fields gone to gray weeds. A few dead fish float near the shore. In the distance, the black walls of Chernogrod rise on a hill, the last living city on a dying river. Mist rises from the water despite no temperature difference. The scene conveys environmental devastation, mourning, and the visible spread of supernatural corruption. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy cursed river landscape illustration.

### River Crossing/Settlement
**Prompt:**
> The Broken Bridge over the lower Chorna, a once-grand stone structure now collapsed into the gray water. Ruins of the bridge's towers stand on either bank, the Ash Road ending abruptly at each side. The river below is thick and wrong-colored, almost oily. Debris and darker shapes float past—not all of it wood. On the far bank, the desolation of the Ashen Fields begins, gray earth stretching to the horizon. A single raven perches on a broken pillar. No other life is visible. The scene marks the boundary between the dying and the dead. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy ruined bridge illustration.

## Notes
- Use Slavic/Eastern European naming conventions
- The Chorna should feel like a dying patient, not just a polluted river—something alive being murdered
- The curse's spread is measurable and terrifying; this is environmental horror
- [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s betrayal makes everything worse
- The river connects to the broader threat: what's killing the Chorna will eventually kill all of Eldermyr
