# The Crown Lands

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Crown Lands represent the political and cultural heart of Eldermyr—fertile, wealthy, and currently contested. This region reflects English/French Medieval naming conventions.

## Overview
The Crown Lands form the fertile heartland of Eldermyr, a patchwork of rich farmland, gentle hills, and prosperous towns centered on the ancient capital of [[Aldersgate]]. For centuries, this region has been the seat of royal power, the breadbasket that feeds the realm, and [[Crossford|the crossroads]] where all roads meet. Now, with the throne empty and factions circling, the Crown Lands have become the prize everyone fights to control—and the battleground where the next war will likely begin.

|-------|------------|--------|
| Native Crown-folk | 85% | Throughout |
| [[The Western Shore]] settlers | 8% | Trade cities |
| [[The Eastern March]] descent | 4% | Eastern towns |
| Northern blood | 3% | Rural areas |

### Languages
**Common:** The King's Tongue (the realm's standard language, based on Crown Lands dialect)
**Regional:** None distinct; this is where the standard is set

### Social Structure
The Crown Lands epitomize Eldermyr's feudal hierarchy: great lords hold lands granted by the crown, lesser nobles serve them, and peasants work the fields their ancestors have tilled for generations. The proximity to [[Aldersgate]] means political maneuvering is constant—even minor lords scheme for influence at court.

## Government & Politics

### Political Status
**Type:** Royal Domain (currently contested regency)

### Ruling Authority
**Ruler:** [[Lord Varic Valdren]] (as Regent for [[Edric Valdren]])
**Title:** Lord Regent of the Crown Lands
**Seat of Power:** [[Aldersgate]] (the Ironthrone Hall)

### Government Structure
The Crown Lands are administered directly by the crown through appointed castellans and royal judges. With the king dead and a child heir, [[Lord Varic Valdren]] has claimed the regency, but his authority is contested by the other great houses. In practice, much of the region's daily governance falls to [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s courts and local lords who wait to see which way the wind blows.

### Laws & Justice
Notable legal traditions:
- The King's Law applies directly; no regional variations permitted
- High crimes are tried before the Royal Court in [[Aldersgate]]
- [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]]'s courts handle matters of marriage, inheritance, and moral disputes
- The right of appeal to the crown (currently suspended due to succession crisis)

### External Relations
| Neighbor | Relationship | Issues |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| [[The Western Shore]] | Alliance ([[House Valdren]] controls both) | [[Edric Valdren]]'s claim flows through Valdren blood |
| [[The Eastern March]] | Tense | [[House Thorne]] disputes the regency |
| [[The Karath Reach]] | Hostile | [[House Karath]] were crushed in [[The Great War]] |
| [[The Northlands]] | Neutral | Northern lords wait and watch |

## Economy

### Primary Industries
| Industry | Importance | Locations |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Agriculture | Dominant | Throughout |
| Trade | Major | [[Aldersgate]], [[Crossford]] |
| Crafts | Significant | [[Aldersgate]], [[Thornhall]] |
| Administration | Significant | [[Aldersgate]] |

### Trade
**Exports:**
- Grain (feeds much of the realm)

### Wealth
**Prosperity:** Prosperous (historically wealthy, now strained)

**Distribution:** The Crown Lands have always been wealthy, but twenty-three years of peace have made some lords fat while others resent the new order. The recent uncertainty has frozen trade and left harvests unsold—prosperity is turning anxious.

## Culture

### Regional Identity
Crown-folk consider themselves the true Eldermyr—the standard against which all else is measured. Their speech is the language of law and literature; their customs are the realm's customs. This can make them seem arrogant to outsiders, but it also creates a strong sense of shared identity and duty to the realm as a whole.

| Coronation Day | Spring | Celebrates the founding of the unified realm |
| Harvest Home | Autumn | Thanksgiving for the year's bounty |
| Remembrance Night | Autumn Equinox | Honoring the dead (Faith holy day) |

### Religion
**Dominant Faith:** [[The Faith of the Three]] (Orthodox, centered in [[Thornhall]])

**Other Faiths:**
- [[The Faith of the Three]] is nearly universal here; the Crown Lands are [[The Faith of the Three]]'s heartland

**Sacred Sites:**
- [[Thornhall]] — [[Thornhall|The holy city]], seat of the Synod, site of the Great Cathedral

## History

### Origins
The Crown Lands were the core of the original kingdom before unification. [[Aldersgate]] has been a seat of power for over a thousand years, growing from a hill-fort on the Kingswater to the greatest city in the realm. When the various regions were united under a single crown, it was the Crown Lands' king who claimed that honor.

### Key Events
| Era | Event | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| ~1000 years ago | Founding of [[Aldersgate]] | Beginning of centralized power |
| ~500 years ago | Unification under the Crown | Crown Lands become heart of unified realm |
| 27 years ago | Rise of [[The Mad King]] | Tyranny and dark rituals from the throne |
| 23 years ago | [[The Great War]] | Realm torn apart; Mad King slain |
| 3 months ago | Death of [[High King Aldric II]] | Current succession crisis begins |

### Former Rulers
Previous powers that controlled this region:
- The House of Aldric (current royal line, founded ~500 years ago)
- Pre-unification tribal kings (legendary era)

### Recent History
[[High King Aldric II]] maintained peace for twenty-three years through diplomacy, marriage alliances, and careful management. His death has thrown everything into chaos. [[Lord Varic Valdren]] has claimed the regency for his grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]], but holds power through Valdren gold and western trade connections rather than true legitimacy. The other houses circle like wolves.
