# The Deep Delving

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a cave, create a natural underground environment with distinctive geological features, atmospheric conditions, and ecological systems. Consider the cave's formation, what resources it contains, who or what inhabits it, and its significance to nearby settlements. Caves should feel like believable geological formations with hazards and rewards appropriate to their depth and type.

## Overview
The Deep Delving is not a natural cave but something far more impressive—the greatest work of dwarvenkind ever constructed in Eldermyr, a city-mine that once reached miles into the roots of [[The Greycrowns]]. For over a thousand years, the dwarves of the Delving extracted mithril, adamantine, and stranger metals from the mountain's heart, forging wonders that still exist today—including the legendary [[The Iron Gate Pass|Iron Gate]] itself. Then, three centuries ago, the gates were sealed from within. No messenger came; no explanation was given. The silence has never been broken. What drove an entire civilization to entomb itself remains Eldermyr's deepest mystery.

## Classification

### Type
**Cave Type:** Dwarven Mine/City (artificial construction, not natural cave)

**Formation:** Excavated / Constructed (over 1,200+ years of continuous work)

### Scale
**Depth:** Unfathomed (known levels reach 2,000 feet; sealed levels go deeper)

**Total Length:** Unknown; estimates suggest 50+ miles of tunnels and chambers

**Number of Chambers:** Hundreds (known); thousands (estimated)

### Status
**Exploration Status:** Partially Explored (upper levels only; lower sealed)

**Inhabited:** Officially no; rumors persist of sounds from below

## Location

### Geographic Position
**Region:** [[The Greycrowns]], northern Eldermyr

**Nearest Settlement:** Northfolk camps (seasonal); Coldwater (40 miles south)

**Distance:** Remote; 3-5 days travel from nearest human settlement

### Entrance
**Entrance Type:** Multiple (main gates sealed; secondary entrances rumored)

**Entrance Description:**
The primary entrance is a massive stone portal carved into the mountainside, flanked by towering dwarf statues holding hammers. The doors—twenty feet high and ten feet thick—remain closed and sealed with dwarven mechanisms that have defeated every attempt to open them. Strange runes glow faintly along the door frame during certain lunar phases.

### Accessibility
**Difficulty to Reach:** Difficult (mountain terrain, no roads, weather hazards)

**Known Paths:**
- The Old Dwarf Road (partially intact; ends at sealed gates)
- Northfolk trails through the high passes
- No known accessible entrance

### Concealment
**Visibility:** Obvious (main gates); Hidden (secondary entrances)

**How to Find:**
The main gates are visible from miles away—carved into a sheer cliff face, impossible to miss. Finding a way inside is another matter entirely. Secondary entrances, if they exist, have never been reliably located.

## Physical Characteristics

### General Environment
The accessible exterior shows masterwork stone construction that has weathered three centuries without significant deterioration. The stone is warm to the touch even in winter—forges once burned deep below. Faint vibrations can sometimes be felt through the rock, dismissed by most as geological settling but interpreted by others as evidence that something still moves in the depths.

### Entrance Zone
**Light:** Natural light illuminates the entrance plaza and first antechamber (through sealed gates; windows above)

**Temperature:** Warm (45-55°F even in winter; internal heat source)

**Atmosphere:** Clean; ventilation shafts still function

### Twilight Zone
**Light:** Dim light from luminescent fungi (dwarven cultivation, still growing)

**Temperature:** Constant 55°F

**Atmosphere:** Stale but breathable; dust particles

### Dark Zone
**Light:** Complete darkness (or strange glows reported by those claiming to have entered)

**Temperature:** Increases with depth (reports of heat shimmer in lower levels)

**Atmosphere:** Unknown; possibly dangerous in sealed sections

### Water Presence
**Water Features:** Underground river (the Deepflow); reservoirs; aqueducts

**Water Quality:** Reportedly excellent (mineral-rich; possibly magical properties)

**Water Flow:** The Deepflow emerges from the mountain base; water still flows from within

### Air Quality
**Breathability:** Good (upper levels); Unknown (sealed sections)

**Hazards:**
- Possible toxic gases in sealed areas
- Volcanic vents in deepest levels (theoretical)
- "Bad air" warnings in dwarven script near certain passages

## Geology

### Rock Type
**Primary Rock:** Granite (mountain core); Marble (carved chambers)

**Secondary Formations:** Quartz veins, mineral deposits, geode formations (enhanced by dwarven work)

### Formation History
The Greycrowns formed from ancient volcanic activity, creating rich mineral deposits. The dwarves discovered these deposits over 1,500 years ago and began excavation. Over twelve centuries, they carved out a city-mine of unprecedented scope, following veins of precious metals ever deeper into the earth—until they found something that made them stop.

**Dimensions:** 400 feet long, 200 feet wide, 150 feet high (estimated from dwarven records)

**Description:**
The first great chamber beyond the gates, the Hall of Ancestors was both memorial and museum. Colossal statues of every dwarven king lined the walls, each holding the tools of their reign—picks, hammers, crowns.

## Cultural Significance

### Local Legends
The Deep Delving features in countless stories across Eldermyr. The Northfolk speak of it as a sleeping giant—dormant but not dead. Mothers tell children that bad behavior will wake the dwarves. Scholars debate what caused the Sealing. Treasure hunters dream of the mithril that lies unclaimed. Everyone agrees: something terrible happened, and whatever it was, the dwarves chose death over letting it escape.

### Religious Meaning
- The Old Ways consider it a sacred threshold between worlds
- Some believe the dwarves achieved transcendence, not death
- The New Faith officially considers it cursed ground
- Dwarf-ancestor worship continues among Northfolk communities

### Superstitions
Local beliefs about the cave:
- Speaking the old dwarvish words near the gates invites doom
- Those who dream of the Delving are being called
- The Sleeper in the deep will wake when the kingdom falls
- Items from the Delving carry both blessing and curse

### Historical Use
Past uses of the cave:
- Dwarf civilization: home, mine, fortress (1,200+ years)
- Trade hub: connected dwarf and human economies
- Forge of legends: greatest dwarf-works created here
- Currently: sealed tomb or prison

## History

### Geological Formation
The Greycrowns rose from volcanic activity millions of years ago, creating rich mineral deposits throughout the range. The specific mountain chosen by the dwarves held the richest veins ever discovered—gold, silver, gems, and deep below, mithril and adamantine. Natural caves were expanded into the greatest underground city in the known world.

### Discovery
Dwarves discovered the ore deposits approximately 1,500 years ago. Within a century, they had established a permanent settlement. Within three centuries, the Deep Delving had become the center of dwarven civilization in Eldermyr—the beating heart of an underground kingdom.

### Historical Use
How has the cave been used throughout history?
- **Early Era:** Mining and initial settlement
- **Golden Age:** City of 50,000+ dwarves; trade with surface
- **The Deepening:** Expansion into lower levels seeking mithril
- **The Warning:** Miners began reporting strange discoveries
- **The Sealing:** Gates closed; no communication since

### Notable Events
1. **The Founding (1,500 years ago):** First dwarf settlers establish the Delving
2. **The Great Trade (800 years ago):** Peak of surface-dwarf commerce; Iron Gate forged
3. **The Discovery (350 years ago):** Miners report finding "something old" in deepest levels
4. **The Silence (320 years ago):** Communication from Delving becomes sporadic
5. **The Sealing (300 years ago):** Gates close; final messengers speak of "necessity"

### Current Era
The Deep Delving has remained sealed for three centuries. Multiple attempts to breach the gates have failed. The Northfolk maintain a respectful distance. Whatever wealth lies within—and whatever threat prompted the Sealing—remains locked away. Recent reports suggest increased activity: lights in windows, sounds from below, and the Seal's magical pulse growing stronger.

## Secrets

1. The dwarves dug too deep and broke into a pre-human prison-vault containing an entity called "The Sleeper"—not a creature but a fragment of primordial darkness that corrupts everything it touches. The Sealing was the dwarves' final act: they locked themselves inside with it rather than let it escape.

2. A small group of dwarves did escape through a hidden passage known only to the royal line. Their descendants live among the Northfolk, guarding the secret entrance and watching for signs that the Seal is weakening. One key to opening the Seal from outside lies with them.

3. The Sealing was never meant to be permanent—the dwarves believed heroes would eventually arrive who could destroy The Sleeper. They left weapons and instructions for that purpose, sealed in a chamber accessible from outside... if one knows where to look. The recent stirring suggests The Sleeper is waking, and time grows short.

## Plot Hooks

1. The Northfolk guardians contact the party: the Seal is failing, and someone must enter the Delving to reinforce it—or face what's emerging. They offer the secret entrance but warn that nothing has prepared them for what lies within.

2. An ancient dwarf journal surfaces, written by a survivor of the Sealing. It contains the location of the "Hero's Cache"—weapons designed to destroy The Sleeper. But others want the journal, and the Cache may be trapped.

3. A merchant arrives in Eldoria with mithril for sale—genuine Deep Delving mithril, still bearing forge marks. He claims he found it outside the gates, but the metal is newly worked. Someone or something is forging in the Delving's darkness.

4. Strange dreams plague the party: visions of endless tunnels, dwarf voices calling for help, and something vast and patient waiting in the dark. The dreams contain clues to finding the secret entrance—but also warnings that some doors should remain closed.

## Notes
The Deep Delving represents one of the greatest mysteries and greatest treasures in Eldermyr. The mithril alone would make whoever claims it the wealthiest power in the realm—but the Sealing suggests that whatever lies within is worth more than any treasure to keep contained. The connection between The Sleeper and the curse spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]] is unclear but potentially significant: are they related? Is one a consequence of the other? The answer may determine Eldermyr's fate.
