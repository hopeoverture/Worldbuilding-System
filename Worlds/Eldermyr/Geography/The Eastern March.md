# The Eastern March

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Eastern March is [[House Thorne]]'s domain—martial, disciplined, and proud. This region reflects Germanic/Anglo-Saxon naming conventions with harsh consonants and guttural sounds.

## Overview
The Eastern March stands as Eldermyr's shield against the unknown lands beyond the mountains. For generations, [[House Thorne]] has held these highlands, forging a people as hard as the stone they quarry and as cold as the wind that howls through the Ostmark Pass. This is a land of fortresses and forges, where every child learns sword-work before letters, and martial glory is the only currency that matters. Now, with the throne empty, [[House Thorne|the Thornes]] believe the crown they defended should rightfully be theirs.

## Demographics

### Population
**Total:** ~350,000
**Density:** Moderate (concentrated in valleys and fortress-towns)

### Peoples
| Group | Percentage | Region |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Marcher Folk | 90% | Throughout |
| [[The Crown Lands]] descent | 5% | Trade towns |
| Northern blood | 3% | Highland areas |
| Foreign (legal) | 2% | Ostmark Pass trading post |

### Languages
**Common:** The King's Tongue (with strong regional accent)
**Regional:** Old Marcher (Germanic elements, used in oaths and battle-cries)

### Social Structure
The Eastern March operates on a simple principle: those who fight, rule. Noble houses are warrior houses; their rank depends on their military record. Common folk earn respect through service in the march's armies. A peasant who distinguishes himself in battle can rise higher than a coward born to privilege. This meritocracy of violence makes the Marchers both feared and respected.

## Government & Politics

### Political Status
**Type:** Semi-autonomous Province (historically sworn to the crown, but with significant independence)

### Ruling Authority
**Ruler:** [[Lady Margret Thorne]]
**Title:** Wardeness of the Eastern March, [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady of Stahlburg]]
**Seat of Power:** [[Stahlburg]]

### Government Structure
[[House Thorne]] rules through military hierarchy. The Wardeness commands; her generals—currently her three sons—administer regions. Every able-bodied person owes military service. Local lords are essentially garrison commanders. Justice is swift and harsh. The March has always operated with significant autonomy from the crown, a necessity given its defensive responsibilities.

### Laws & Justice
Notable legal traditions:
- Trial by combat is legal and common
- Cowardice is punished by death or exile
- Theft from a fellow soldier is treated more harshly than murder
- Foreign spies are executed publicly at Ostmark Pass

### External Relations
| Neighbor | Relationship | Issues |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| [[The Crown Lands]] | Hostile | [[House Thorne]] disputes the Valdren regency |
| [[The Western Shore]] | Cold | Valdrens are soft merchants, not true rulers |
| [[The Northlands]] | Neutral | Respect for fellow frontier folk |
| [[The Karath Reach]] | Contemptuous | Defeated traitors deserve no mercy |
| Foreign Lands (East) | Watchful | Constant vigilance, occasional skirmishes |

## Economy

### Primary Industries
| Industry | Importance | Locations |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Iron Mining | Dominant | Throughout the mountains |
| Smithing | Major | [[Stahlburg]], [[Hammerhall]] |
| Military Service | Significant | Entire region |
| Timber | Moderate | The Thornwood |

### Trade
**Exports:**
- Iron and steel (finest in the realm)
- Weapons and armor
- Mercenary companies
- Trained warhorses

**Imports:**
- Grain (the March cannot feed itself)
- Luxury goods (rare, considered soft)
- Salt and preserved food
- Skilled craftsmen for specialized work

**Trade Partners:**
- [[The Crown Lands|Crown Lands]] (grain for iron)
- [[The Western Shore|Western Shore]] (reluctantly, for luxuries)
- Foreign kingdoms (controlled trade through Ostmark Pass)

### Trade Routes
Major paths through or to the region:
- [[The King's Road]] — Eastern branch to [[Stahlburg]]
- [[Ostmark Pass]] — The only major route to foreign lands, heavily controlled
- River routes along the Stahlfluss to the forges

### Wealth
**Prosperity:** Modest (wealthy in iron, poor in food)

**Distribution:** Wealth in the March is measured in arms and armor, not gold. Lords are rich in soldiers; peasants are poor but proud. The March depends on trade with [[The Crown Lands|the Crown Lands]] for food, a vulnerability that rankles.

## Culture

### Regional Identity
Marchers define themselves by what they are not: they are not soft courtiers, not scheming merchants, not superstitious peasants. They are warriors. Every aspect of their culture—their architecture, their art, their religion—serves the purpose of making better soldiers. This can seem grim to outsiders, but Marchers take fierce pride in their discipline and sacrifice.

### Traditions
- Blood-oaths sworn on iron
- The Warrior's Wake — week-long mourning and feasting for fallen soldiers
- Naming sons after legendary commanders
- Young nobles fostered at different fortresses to build unity

### Festivals
| Festival | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| The Iron Forging | Spring | Beginning of the campaign season, blessing of weapons |
| Wardenmass | Summer | Anniversary of [[House Thorne]] taking the March |
| The Long Watch | Winter Solstice | All-night vigil commemorating border defenders |

### Religion
**Dominant Faith:** [[The Faith of the Three]] (The Warden's Hand variant)

**Other Faiths:**
- Orthodox Faith observed but considered too soft
- Soldier's superstitions and battlefield rituals

**Sacred Sites:**
- The Hall of the Fallen ([[Stahlburg]]) — Memorial to all who died defending the realm
- The Warden's Shrine (Ostmark Pass) — Blessing for those crossing the border

### Art & Architecture
Regional styles:
- Massive stone fortifications, function over form
- Iron decoration and weaponry as art
- Stark heraldry in black, silver, and blood red
- Monumental sculpture of warriors and battle scenes

## History

### Origins
The Eastern March was created five hundred years ago when the unified realm needed a dedicated defense against the foreign powers beyond the mountains. [[House Thorne|The Thornes]], then a minor noble family known for military prowess, were given the March on condition that they hold it forever. They have, at terrible cost, and they believe this sacrifice has been forgotten.

### Key Events
| Era | Event | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 500 years ago | Creation of the March | [[House Thorne]] given the east |
| 300 years ago | The Eastern War | Thorne ancestors repelled major invasion |
| 27 years ago | Rise of [[The Mad King]] | Many Marchers initially supported strong rule |
| 23 years ago | [[The Great War]] | [[House Thorne]] switched sides, lost thousands |
| 3 months ago | Death of [[High King Aldric II]] | [[Lady Margret Thorne]] sees opportunity |

### Former Rulers
Previous powers that controlled this region:
- Scattered highland clans (pre-March era)
- [[House Thorne]] (for 500 years, unbroken)

### Recent History
[[House Thorne]] paid dearly in [[The Great War]]. Initially supportive of [[The Mad King]]'s strong rule, they switched sides when his madness became undeniable. They sacrificed more than any other house—[[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] lost her husband and eldest son at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. For twenty-three years, she has nursed her grievances while [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] rewarded [[House Valdren]] with the regency. Now she believes the time has come to claim what blood has earned.

## Secrets

1. **[[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] is dying.** A wasting illness gives her perhaps a year to live. Her urgency to see a Thorne on the throne is personal—she wants to die knowing her sacrifices meant something.

2. **Something came through the Pass during [[The Great War]].** In the chaos, something crossed from the foreign lands. [[House Thorne]] have been hunting it for twenty years and still don't know what it is.

3. **The foreign power beyond the mountains is massing.** Scouts report unprecedented military buildup. [[House Thorne|The Thornes]] need the crown's resources to prepare, but no one in [[Aldersgate]] is listening.

4. **[[Ser Viktor Thorne]] has made contact with the foreign power.** He believes his mother's ambitions will destroy the realm and has secretly negotiated a non-aggression pact—for a price.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Burned Hold:** [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] hires the party to investigate the ruins. Something killed a patrol there, and she needs to know what.

2. **Beyond the Pass:** A foreign dignitary crosses into Eldermyr with an urgent warning—and is immediately arrested. The party must decide whose side they're on.

3. **The Wasting:** [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]]'s illness is no natural sickness. Someone is poisoning the Wardeness, and her sons will pay any price to find out who.

4. **The Forge of Legends:** [[Grimhild the Smith]] claims she can forge a weapon that will unite the realm—but she needs materials from beyond the Ostmark Pass.
