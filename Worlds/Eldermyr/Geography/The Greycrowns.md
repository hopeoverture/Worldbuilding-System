# The Greycrowns

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Greycrowns form Eldermyr's ancient northern barrier—snow-capped, treacherous, and steeped in Old Ways tradition. Use Norse/Celtic naming conventions for peaks, passes, and landmarks.

## Overview
The Greycrowns are the oldest mountains in Eldermyr, a wall of gray granite and eternal snow separating the realm from the frozen wastes beyond. Their peaks have stood since before humans walked these lands, worn smooth by millennia of ice and wind into distinctive rounded crowns that give them their name. Few passes pierce this ancient barrier, and those who attempt the crossing without guides often join the countless bones scattered across the high glaciers. The Northfolk say the mountains are the corpses of primordial giants, turned to stone in a war against the gods—and on winter nights when the peaks groan under shifting ice, it's easy to believe.

## Classification

### Type
**Mountain Type:** Ancient Fold Mountains (heavily eroded)

### Age
**Geological Age:** Ancient/Worn — Among the oldest mountains in the known world, predating even the Age of Clans

### Scale
**Length:** ~400 miles from east to west
**Width:** 50-80 miles north to south
**Highest Elevation:** 14,200 feet (Vindrtind)
**Average Elevation:** 8,000-10,000 feet for major peaks

## Physical Features

### Major Peaks
| Peak | Elevation | Notable For |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Vindrtind (Wind's Peak) | 14,200 ft | Highest peak; perpetual storms; said to be where the Chronicler watches |
| Hrímhorn (Frost Horn) | 13,400 ft | Sacred to the Old Ways; site of ancient rituals |
| Járnkróna (Iron Crown) | 12,800 ft | Rich iron deposits; Forgemasters pilgrimage site |
| Úlfsbeinn (Wolf's Bone) | 11,600 ft | Distinctive white limestone; dire wolf hunting grounds |
| The Grey Sisters | 10,500-11,200 ft | Three peaks in a row; navigation landmark |

### Highest Peak
**Name:** Vindrtind (The Wind's Peak)
**Elevation:** 14,200 feet
**Description:** A broad, wind-scoured summit perpetually wreathed in storm clouds. The peak is said to be the Chronicler's watching post, where the god of death observes all souls in Eldermyr. No verified ascent has ever been recorded, though the Northfolk claim their ancestors once climbed it to speak with the dead.
**First Ascent:** Unknown; claimed by ancient Northfolk, unverified

### Passes
| Pass | Elevation | Connects | Difficulty |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| [[The Greycrown Gap]] | 6,400 ft | [[The Northlands]] ↔ Northern Wastes | Treacherous |
| Smuggler's Notch | 7,200 ft | Secret route used by criminals | Deadly |
| The Pilgrim's Path | 5,800 ft | [[Vindrheim]] ↔ Hrímhorn shrine | Difficult |
| Frozen Gate | 8,100 ft | Ancient road, now impassable | Impassable |

### Valleys
Notable valleys within the range:
- **Vindrdal (Wind Valley)** — Protected valley below Vindrtind; site of the monastery of the Chronicler's Silence
- **Járndal (Iron Valley)** — Mining valley rich in ore; [[The Forgemasters Guild]] operates here
- **Úlfsgil (Wolf's Ravine)** — Narrow gorge where dire wolves den; extremely dangerous

### Glaciers
- **Hrímjökull (Frost Glacier)** — The largest glacier, feeding the headwaters of [[The Kingswater]]
- **The Weeping Ice** — Glacier with blue ice caves; said to preserve the bodies of ancient kings
- **Vindrtind's Shroud** — Permanent ice cap on the highest peak

### Caves & Caverns
- **The Singing Caves** — Wind creates musical sounds; Old Ways ceremonial site
- **Járnhellir (Iron Cavern)** — Natural cavern system connected to iron mines
- **The Tomb of Giants** — Massive cave system with suspiciously regular stonework

## Geology

### Formation
The Greycrowns formed over 500 million years ago when ancient tectonic plates collided, pushing up mountains that once rivaled the world's highest peaks. Millennia of glacial erosion have worn them down to their current rounded profiles, but the core remains solid granite and gneiss harder than steel. The distinctive gray color comes from a high mica content that sparkles in sunlight.

### Rock Types
- Gray granite (dominant)
- Metamorphic gneiss
- White limestone (Úlfsbeinn region)
- Iron-bearing rock (Járndal)

### Volcanic Activity
**Status:** Dormant

**Notable Volcanoes:**
- **Eldsker (Fire Reef)** — Dormant volcano at the eastern end; hot springs indicate magma still present below

### Earthquakes
Seismic activity: Rare but significant. The mountains occasionally shift, causing avalanches and rockfalls. The Northfolk interpret major quakes as the giants stirring in their stone sleep.

### Minerals & Ores
| Resource | Location | Mined? |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Iron | Járndal (Iron Valley) | Yes — [[The Forgemasters Guild]] |
| Silver | Scattered veins | Limited |
| Gems (garnets, sapphires) | Glacier moraines | Opportunistic |
| Mithral (legendary) | Unknown | Rumored only |

## Climate & Weather

### Climate Zones
How climate changes with elevation:
- **Base (below 4,000 ft):** Cool temperate; snowy winters, brief summers
- **Mid-elevation (4,000-8,000 ft):** Alpine; snow 8+ months; harsh winds
- **High elevation (8,000-12,000 ft):** Permanent snow; survival requires shelter
- **Peaks (above 12,000 ft):** Polar conditions; unlivable without magic

### Weather Patterns
**Prevailing Winds:** Fierce northerlies bringing arctic air; winds can reach 100+ mph at high elevations

**Precipitation:** Heavy snowfall (200+ inches annually at elevation); rare summer rain at lower elevations

**Storms:** Sudden blizzards can strike even in summer; "Grey Wrath" storms can last for days

### Seasonal Changes
- **Winter (7 months):** Passes completely blocked; only the hardiest can survive
- **Spring (1 month):** Dangerous melt; avalanche season
- **Summer (3 months):** Brief window for travel; still cold at elevation
- **Autumn (1 month):** Rapid freeze; last chance to descend

### Dangers
Weather-related hazards:
- Blizzards with zero visibility
- Avalanches (especially spring)
- Hypothermia (year-round at elevation)
- Wind strong enough to blow climbers off cliffs
- "Grey Wrath" storms that last days

## Ecology

### Vegetation Zones
| Zone | Elevation | Flora |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Foothills | Below 4,000 ft | Pine forest, hardy shrubs, berry bushes |
| Montane | 4,000-6,500 ft | Stunted conifers, mountain ash, lichen |
| Subalpine | 6,500-9,000 ft | Krummholz (twisted dwarf trees), mosses |
| Alpine | Above 9,000 ft | Lichens, scattered grasses, bare rock |

### Wildlife
**Common:**
- Mountain goats, marmots, snow hares
- Ravens, eagles, ptarmigan
- Trout in mountain streams

**Rare:**
- Snow leopards
- Giant mountain elk (Northfolk call them "Járndýr")

**Dangerous:**
- [[Northland Dire Wolf|Dire wolves]] (packs of 6-12)
- [[Iron Peak Wyvern|Wyverns]] (rare, territorial)
- Bears (aggressive, especially in spring)

### Unique Species
Creatures found only here:
- **Greycrown Rams** — Massive sheep with spiral horns; prized for wool and meat
- **Frost Moths** — Large white moths that somehow survive the cold; their cocoons have alchemical uses
- **Stone Salamanders** — Lizards that live in hot springs near Eldsker

## Inhabitants

### Mountain Peoples
| People | Location | Lifestyle |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| [[Goliaths]] | High peaks, above treeline | Nomadic herding, competitive traditions |
| Northfolk clans | Valleys, foothills | Herding, hunting, Old Ways worship |
| Chronicler's monks | Vindrdal monastery | Contemplation, tending the dead |
| Mining families | Járndal | Generation miners serving the Forgemasters |

### Settlements
| Settlement | Type | Population |
|------------|------|------------|
| [[Vindrheim]] | Trade town | ~8,000 |
| [[Coldwater]] | Gateway town | ~1,800 |
| Járnby (Iron Village) | Mining settlement | ~600 |
| Úlfsgard (Wolf's Guard) | Fortified outpost | ~200 |
| Monastery of Silence | Religious community | ~50 |

### Goliath Territories
The [[Goliaths]] claim the highest reaches of the Greycrowns as their domain—the peaks and high plateaus above 9,000 feet where other peoples cannot easily survive. Approximately 2,500 goliaths move through these territories in three major tribes:

- **The Cloudwalker Tribe (~800)** — Dwell near Vindrtind (Wind's Peak), the highest peaks. Mystical; their shamans claim to speak with storm spirits. Rarely descend below 10,000 feet.
- **The Stonekeeper Tribe (~1,200)** — The largest and most accessible tribe, holding territory above Járndal and trading occasionally with the mining communities. Stonekeeper Vaunea Thunderbrow leads them with pragmatic authority.
- **The Icecrown Tribe (~500)** — Dwell in the frozen northeastern reaches. Rarely seen; considered the hardiest and most isolationist. Said to know passes into the northern wastes that no human has mapped.

**The Proving Grounds:** A sacred plateau near the Grey Sisters peaks where goliath youth undergo the Proving—a series of trials that mark the transition to adulthood. Each year during summer's brief window, the tribes gather here for competitions, marriages, and councils. It's the closest thing goliaths have to a permanent settlement, with ceremonial stone platforms carved by countless generations.

Goliaths trade furs, mountain herbs, and guidance services in exchange for metal tools, salt, and grain. They descend to [[Vindrheim]] in summer for the trade season but return to the heights before first snow. The succession crisis in the lowlands means nothing to them—but the rising dead in [[The Ashen Fields]] concerns them deeply. If that corruption spreads to their mountains, the tribes have sworn to descend in force.

### Fortifications
Castles, fortresses, watchtowers:
- **Greywatch** — Ancient watchtower at [[The Greycrown Gap]]; currently manned by a token force
- **Járnborg (Iron Fort)** — Protects the mining operations; [[The Forgemasters Guild]] garrison
- **The Frozen Gates** — Ruined fortification at the impassable eastern pass; pre-unification

### Hermits & Recluses
Those who dwell in isolation:
- The monks of the Chronicler's Silence (voluntary isolation for contemplation)
- [[The Spirit-Speakers]] maintain a hidden lodge somewhere in the peaks
- Rumored: an ancient wizard who retreated here centuries ago

### Monsters & Creatures
Dangerous inhabitants:
- [[Northland Dire Wolf]] packs (intelligent, coordinated hunters)
- [[Iron Peak Wyvern]]s (territorial, attack on sight)
- Ice trolls (rare, found in deepest caves)
- Giants (legendary—the Northfolk believe they sleep in the stone)

## Strategic Importance

### As a Barrier
The Greycrowns form Eldermyr's northern shield, protecting the realm from the frozen wastes and whatever peoples or creatures dwell beyond. For five centuries, no foreign army has crossed these mountains in force. The passes are too treacherous, the weather too deadly, and the Northfolk too stubborn to permit invasion. This natural fortress is why Eldermyr has only ever worried about internal conflict—external threats cannot reach them.

### Passes & Control
The few usable passes are nominally controlled by the Crown, but in practice the Northfolk clans decide who crosses. [[The Greycrown Gap]] has a royal watchtower, but its garrison is small and relies on local cooperation. Smuggler's Notch is uncontrolled and deadly.

### Military Significance
Fortifications and defensive value:
- **Greywatch Tower** — Controls [[The Greycrown Gap]]; could be held by 50 soldiers against an army
- **The Frozen Gates** — Ancient fortification at a now-impassable route; shows the mountains were once more contested
- **Natural chokepoints** — Every pass is a potential killing ground

### Historical Battles
Conflicts fought in these mountains:
- **The Clan Wars (pre-unification)** — Northfolk clans fought each other for control of the passes
- **The Giant's War (legendary)** — Supposedly the giants were defeated and turned to stone here
- **The Smuggler's Rebellion (80 years ago)** — Crown forces attempted to close Smuggler's Notch; failed

## Resources

### Mining
| Mine | Resource | Operator | Output |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Járndal Iron Works | High-quality iron | [[The Forgemasters Guild]] | Significant |
| Silver Creek | Silver ore | Independent miners | Modest |
| The Deep Delving | Unknown (abandoned) | None | Sealed |

### Timber
- Pine and mountain ash from the foothills
- Carefully managed by Northfolk clans
- [[The King's Wood]] imports some northern timber

### Hunting & Trapping
- Greycrown rams (wool, meat, horns)
- Fur-bearing animals (ermine, fox, marten)
- Dire wolf pelts (dangerous to obtain, highly valuable)

### Magical Resources
- **Glacier ice** — Ice from certain glaciers retains cold for months; valuable for preservation
- **Frost moth cocoons** — Alchemical ingredient for cold-resistance potions
- **Iron from Járndal** — Exceptionally pure; some claim minor magical properties

## Travel

- **[[Wyrmbone Spire]]** — A natural rock spire near Grimhold where a young white dragon has claimed an ancient dwarven treasure vault as its lair

## History

### Geological History
The Greycrowns are among the oldest mountains in the known world, formed when continents collided half a billion years ago. They were once as high as the world's mightiest peaks, but ice ages have worn them down to their current rounded profiles. The glaciers continue this work today, grinding the mountains ever lower, century by century.

### Early History
First inhabitants and explorers:
- The Northfolk claim their ancestors crossed the mountains from the frozen north in ancient times
- Before unification, the mountains were entirely Northfolk territory
- The Clan Wars saw different clans fighting for control of the passes

### Major Events
| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| The Crossing (legendary) | ~1,000+ years ago | Northfolk arrive in Eldermyr |
| Unification | ~500 years ago | Crown claims nominal authority over passes |
| Founding of Járndal mines | ~400 years ago | [[The Forgemasters Guild]] establishes operations |
| The Smuggler's Rebellion | ~80 years ago | Crown fails to control secret passes |
| Sealing of the Deep Delving | ~50 years ago | Something found; mine abandoned |

### Legends
Stories told about these mountains:
- **The Sleeping Giants** — The mountains are petrified giants who will wake when the world ends
- **The Chronicler's Watch** — The god of death observes all souls from Vindrtind
- **The Frozen King** — An ancient king preserved in glacier ice, waiting to return
- **The Lost Road** — Beyond the Frozen Gates lies a path to other worlds

## Cultural Significance

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- **The Faith of the Three:** The Chronicler's Silence tradition holds the mountains sacred; the Monastery of Silence is a major pilgrimage site
- **The Old Ways:** The peaks are where the sky meets the earth, where mortals can touch the divine; Hrímhorn is especially holy
- **[[The Forgemasters Guild]]:** Believes the iron from Járndal is blessed; pilgrimage to the mines is part of master craftsman training

### In Folklore
Stories and superstitions:
- Never whistle in the mountains (calls avalanches)
- Bow to the Grey Sisters when you see them (shows respect to the giants)
- Leave offerings at cairns (appeases mountain spirits)
- If you hear singing in the caves, follow it only if you're ready to meet your ancestors

### Names & Etymology
What do the names mean?
- **Greycrowns** — The rounded, gray peaks resemble worn crowns
- **Hrímfjöll** (Old Tongue) — "Frost Mountains"
- **Vindrtind** — "Wind's Peak" (always stormy)
- **Járndal** — "Iron Valley"

## Current Situation

### Political Control
Who claims these mountains?
- **Officially:** The Crown of Eldermyr
- **In practice:** The Northfolk clans govern themselves; Crown authority is nominal
- **Mining rights:** [[The Forgemasters Guild]] controls Járndal by royal charter
- **Religious sites:** [[The Faith of the Three]] (Monastery) and Old Ways practitioners share uneasily

### Conflicts
Current disputes:
- Northfolk clans vs. Crown tax collectors (ongoing tension)
- [[The Faith of the Three]] vs. Old Ways over sacred sites
- Smugglers vs. everyone
- Something stirring in the Deep Delving (rumored)

### Exploration
Uncharted areas:
- Much of the high peaks remains unexplored
- The area beyond the Frozen Gates is unknown
- Deep caves may connect to extensive underworld systems
- What exactly lies at the heart of Vindrtind's storms?

## Key Figures

### Mountain Lords
Rulers of mountain territories:
- **Jarl Eirik Stormborn** — Most powerful Northfolk clan leader; controls the Gap
- **Abbess Sigrid** — Leader of the Monastery of Silence; respected by all faiths

### Famous Explorers
Those who mapped or climbed:
- **Valdis the Wanderer** — Northfolk woman who mapped most known passes (~200 years ago)
- **Brother Aldric** — Monk who established the route to the Monastery
- **The Lost Expedition** — Crown-sponsored attempt to cross the Frozen Gates; never returned

### Legendary Inhabitants
- **The Frozen King** — Ancient ruler preserved in ice; may return
- **The Stone Giants** — Sleep within the mountains; may wake
- **Grandmother Frost** — Old Ways spirit said to guide lost travelers (or lead them astray)

## Secrets

1. **The Deep Delving was sealed because miners broke through into something older.** A cavern system with worked stone predating human presence in Eldermyr. Something moved in the darkness. The Forgemasters paid to have it sealed and never spoke of what was found.

2. **The Frozen Gates once led somewhere.** The ancient road doesn't end at a pass—it ends at a portal. The portal is dormant now, but the rising dead in [[The Ashen Fields]] are disturbing magical energies throughout Eldermyr. The gate may reopen.

3. **Jarl Eirik has been contacted by agents of [[House Karath]].** [[Lord Draven Karath]] is seeking allies against the other houses. The Northfolk have old grievances against the Crown. An alliance could mean the Greycrowns closed to royal forces at a critical moment.

4. **The monks of the Chronicler's Silence know the dead are not resting.** They have felt the disturbance since [[The Ashen Fields]] began to wake. Abbess Sigrid has sent secret messages to [[High Confessor Maren]], but received no response.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Deep Delving:** [[The Forgemasters Guild]] needs discreet adventurers to investigate strange sounds coming from behind the sealed mine. They'll pay well—and insist on absolute secrecy about what's found.

2. **The Lost Expedition:** A map surfaces claiming to show what the Crown expedition found beyond the Frozen Gates—fifty years ago. Someone wants to follow their trail. The Northfolk want to stop them.

3. **The Frozen King:** A glacier is retreating faster than normal, revealing ancient ice caves. Inside, Northfolk scouts have found a preserved body wearing a crown. Is this the legendary Frozen King? What happens if he's disturbed?

4. **Mountain Alliance:** [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s agents are in [[Vindrheim]], negotiating with Jarl Eirik. The Crown needs someone to find out what's being offered—and perhaps make a counteroffer before it's too late.

5. **The Monastery's Warning:** Abbess Sigrid secretly contacts the party. The dead are not resting. The Chronicler's servants are troubled. Something must be done about [[The Ashen Fields]], and [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] in [[Thornhall]] refuses to act.

6. **The Proving Grounds Intrusion:** Someone—or something—has desecrated the [[Goliaths|goliath]] Proving Grounds. Stonekeeper Vaunea Thunderbrow is furious, but the tribes lack the numbers to both guard their sacred site and investigate the source. She needs outside help, and she's willing to share goliath knowledge of the high passes in return—including routes into the northern wastes that no human has mapped.

7. **The Cloudwalker Vision:** The shamans of the Cloudwalker tribe have seen something in their communion with the storm spirits—a vision of dead things walking through the high passes, corrupting the mountains themselves. If this comes to pass, the goliaths will have nowhere left to retreat. Stonekeeper Vaunea believes the vision can be prevented, but only if someone can reach the source of the corruption: [[The Ashen Fields]], far to the south. She seeks lowlander allies for a mission the goliaths cannot accomplish alone.

- The Old Ways are strongest here; [[The Faith of the Three]] shares space uneasily
- These mountains have secrets older than human civilization in Eldermyr
- The Northfolk are not hostile to outsiders, but they don't suffer fools
