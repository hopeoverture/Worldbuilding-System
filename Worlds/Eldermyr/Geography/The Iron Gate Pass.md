# The Iron Gate Pass

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a mountain pass, create a critical route through otherwise impassable terrain. Include the approach from both sides, the dangers of crossing, and the strategic importance. Passes should feel like narrow threads connecting worlds—vital, contested, and often perilous.

## Overview
The Iron Gate Pass is Eldermyr's eastern door—the only practical route through [[The Ostmark Range]] for armies or large caravans. For centuries, House Thorne has fortified this narrow gap with walls, towers, and the infamous Iron Gate itself, transforming a natural passage into an impregnable chokepoint. No invading army has ever forced the Gate; no attacking force from Eldermyr has ever returned from the lands beyond. The fortress-pass stands as the eternal shield of the realm's eastern border, manned by the elite Gate Wardens who swear oaths to hold until death. In the current succession crisis, the Iron Gate remains neutral by ancient tradition—but both factions covet its strategic position.

## Classification

### Type
**Pass Type:** Gap / Gorge (natural gap improved into engineered corridor)

### Difficulty
**Crossing Difficulty:** Moderate (for permitted travelers on the road); Difficult to Impossible (for those trying to bypass the Gate)

### Strategic Value
**Importance:** Critical — The only viable eastern passage for armies or heavy traffic

## Location

### Mountain Range
**Name:** [[The Ostmark Range]]
**Position in Range:** Southern-central section; lowest practical crossing

### Connections
**Connects:**
| Side | Region | Distance to Major Settlement |
|------|--------|------------------------------|
| West | [[The Warden's March]] / Eldermyr | 35 miles to [[Thornholt]] |
| East | The Lands Beyond / Unknown | Unknown; no maps reliable |

### Elevation
**Summit Elevation:** 4,200 feet
**Approach Elevations:**
- Western approach: Begins at 1,200 feet
- Eastern approach: Begins at 2,400 feet (eastern lands higher)

## Physical Features

### The Route

#### Approach (Western Side)
**Starting Point:** The March Gate (foot of mountains)
**Distance:** 8 miles to summit
**Grade:** Moderate, engineered switchbacks
**Character:** A well-maintained military road climbs through forested foothills before entering the rocky gorge. Stone retaining walls and regular watchtowers mark the route. The final approach narrows dramatically.

#### Summit/Crest
**Description:** The pass summit is a narrow gap between two towering cliffs, perhaps 200 feet wide at its narrowest. The Iron Gate fortress complex spans this gap entirely, with walls, towers, and the massive iron-bound gate that gives the pass its name. The gate itself is 60 feet high and 40 feet wide—large enough for four wagons abreast.
**Width:** 200 feet at narrowest (entirely occupied by fortifications)
**Features:**
- The Iron Gate (massive iron-bound wooden doors)
- Twin watchtowers (120 feet high)
- Murder holes and defensive positions
- Inner and outer baileys

#### Descent (Eastern Side)
**Ending Point:** The Eastern Watch (outpost at mountain base)
**Distance:** 6 miles to mountain base
**Grade:** Steeper than western approach
**Character:** A rougher road descends through rockier terrain. Less maintained than the western approach; more exposed to weather. The Eastern Watch is the realm's last outpost.

### Terrain
**Rock Type:** Granite and slate; extremely hard and stable
**Stability:** Excellent — ancient rock; minimal erosion

### Landmarks
| Landmark | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| The March Gate | Western base | First checkpoint; wooden palisade |
| The Halfway House | 4 miles up | Stone waystation; supplies |
| The Narrows | 1 mile below summit | Pass dramatically tightens |
| The Iron Gate | Summit | The fortress complex itself |
| The Eastern Watch | Eastern base | Small garrison; furthest outpost |

### Water Sources
- Mountain streams on western approach
- The Gate Well (deep shaft inside fortress; never fails)
- Seasonal snowmelt pools
- Eastern side has fewer reliable sources

### Shelters
Natural refuges:
- Cave complexes on western approach (some fortified)
- Rock overhangs along the road
- The Halfway House provides official shelter
- Nothing reliable on eastern approach

## Climate & Weather

### Conditions
**Summer:** Cool (50-65°F); pleasant travel; occasional thunderstorms
**Winter:** Brutal (-10 to 25°F); heavy snow; passage extremely difficult

### Snow
**First Snow:** Early autumn
**Last Snow:** Late spring
**Snow Depth:** 6-15 feet on summit; drifts can bury the road

### Storms
**Frequency:** Common; mountain weather unpredictable
**Danger:** High — blizzards can trap travelers; lightning strikes exposed areas

### Wind
- Constant wind through the gap (venturi effect)
- Can reach gale force during storms
- Wind chill makes winter crossing dangerous

### Visibility
Fog, clouds, whiteouts:
- Morning fog common in summer
- Cloud cover at summit frequent
- Blizzards create complete whiteout conditions
- Clear days offer views into the Lands Beyond

### Seasonal Accessibility
| Season | Accessibility | Conditions |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Spring | Limited | Snowmelt; mudslides; flooding |
| Summer | Good | Clear passage; best travel season |
| Autumn | Good to Limited | Deteriorating weather; early snow |
| Winter | Emergency Only | Deep snow; extreme cold; gate often closed |

## Hazards

### Natural Dangers
| Hazard | Location | Severity |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Avalanche | Narrows approach | High (winter/spring) |
| Rockfall | Throughout gorge | Moderate |
| Ice | Road surface | High (winter) |
| Weather | Summit area | Severe |
| Altitude | Summit | Moderate (breathing difficulty) |

### Creatures
Dangerous animals:
- Mountain goats (can startle horses)
- Wolves (winter; desperate)
- Bears (autumn; pre-hibernation)
- Eagles (known to attack small livestock)

### Monsters
- Stone giants (rare; avoid the road but inhabit peaks)
- Griffons (nest in high cliffs; territorial)
- Frost worms (deep winter; horrifying but rare)
- Peryton (recent sightings; new arrival?)

### Bandits
Ambush points:
- Effectively impossible — Gate Wardens control all access
- No recorded bandit activity within 20 miles
- The Wardens are the only "toll collectors"

### Getting Lost
Navigation challenges:
- Impossible on the main road (well-marked, well-patrolled)
- Attempting to bypass the Gate through mountains = death sentence
- Eastern side less marked; foreigners become lost easily

## Travel

### Methods
| Method | Feasibility | Time |
|--------|-------------|------|
| On Foot | Good | 1-2 days (through passage) |
| Horse | Good | 8-12 hours |
| Pack Animal | Good | 1 day |
| Wagon | Possible | 2 days (road engineered for it) |

### Time Required
**Good Conditions:** 8-12 hours on horseback; 2 days for wagons
**Poor Conditions:** 2-4 days; may be impossible

### Best Time
When to cross: Mid-summer through early autumn; clear weather; start at dawn

### Supplies Needed
Essential equipment:
- Warm clothing (always cold at summit)
- Food for 3 days minimum
- Travel permits (Gate Wardens require documentation)
- Bribe money (unofficially expected)

### Guides
Who knows the way?
- Gate Wardens provide official escort (required for groups)
- Local mountain folk offer unofficial guidance (risky)
- No one reliably guides through eastern lands

## Infrastructure

### Road/Path
**Type:** Paved (western approach) / Improved (eastern descent)
**Condition:** Excellent (maintained by House Thorne)
**Width:** Two wagons can pass on most sections

### Waypoints

- Three stone bridges over gorge streams
- Cut-stone drainage channels
- Widened sections with passing places
- Signal towers with mirror/fire systems

## Strategic Importance

### As a Barrier
The Ostmark Range is otherwise impassable for armies or heavy commerce. The Iron Gate controls access to Eldermyr from the east—and access to whatever lies beyond.

### Military Significance
**Defensive Value:** Supreme — One of the most defensible positions in the known world
**Choke Point:** The 200-foot gap can be held by dozens against thousands
**Historical Battles:**
- The First Defense (400 years ago) — Invaders from beyond repulsed
- The Siege of Ninety Days (200 years ago) — Eastern horde starved outside the walls
- Multiple smaller engagements; Gate never fallen

### Trade Route
Commercial importance:
- Only eastern trade route
- Exotic goods from beyond occasionally appear
- Historically: furs, gems, strange metals
- Currently: trade nearly nonexistent due to eastern instability

### Control
Who controls the pass?
- The Gate Wardens maintain traditional neutrality
- [[House Thorne]] claims authority but respects tradition
- The Wardens swear oaths to Eldermyr, not to any lord
- In the succession crisis, both sides court the Wardens

### Tolls
| Collector | Rate | Enforcement |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Gate Wardens | 5 gold per wagon / 1 gold per traveler | Absolute |
| "Hospitality fees" | Variable | Customary |
| Emergency passage | Double rates | Strict |

## History

## Key Figures

### Pass Wardens
Those who control the pass:
- Commander Aldric Stone — Current Warden-Commander; veteran of 30 years
- Captain Helena Frost — Second in command; ambitious
- Master Mason Grigor — Maintains the fortress
- The Oath-Keeper — Ancient title; maintains traditions

### Famous Travelers
- King Aldric II (led failed eastern expedition)
- Princess Elara (exiled; passed through to unknown fate)
- The Merchant Princes (returned with treasures and warnings)

### Legendary Figures
- First Warden Aldric (founded the order; may be same name as king?)
- The Iron Smith (forged the original gate; dwarf legend)
- The Night Betrayer (attempted to open the gate; executed)

## Secrets

1. Commander Stone has received envoys from beyond the mountains—something intelligent rules there, and it's been negotiating rather than attacking. Stone has told no one what they want.
2. The original Iron Gate was indeed forged by dwarves of [[The Deep Delving]], and contains bindings that prevent certain entities from passing through; if the gate falls, something sealed behind it may escape
3. Captain Helena Frost has been contacted by [[House Valdren]]—they've offered her command of the Gate and recognition as Lady Warden if she opens the pass to their forces

## Plot Hooks

1. The party must cross the Iron Gate on urgent business—but the Wardens have closed the pass. Why? What have the scouts seen in the east?
2. Commander Stone secretly hires the party to investigate the eastern side without involving his soldiers; what they find may determine the Gate's future
3. Both succession factions plan simultaneous assaults on the Gate; the party must either choose a side or find a way to preserve the neutrality that keeps Eldermyr safe

## Notes
The Iron Gate Pass represents the boundary between the known and unknown in Eldermyr. Whatever lies beyond the mountains—whether treasure, terror, or both—must pass through this single point. The Gate's neutrality in civil conflicts is a pragmatic tradition: if the Gate chose sides, the losing faction might open it to whatever waits in the east out of spite.
