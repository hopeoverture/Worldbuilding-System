# The Karath Reach

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Karath Reach is House Karath's broken domain—once fertile, now cursed. This region reflects Slavic/Eastern European naming conventions with harder sounds. The tone should be bleak, resentful, and haunted.

## Overview
The Karath Reach was once the breadbasket of southern Eldermyr—rich farmland watered by the Chorna River, producing grain that fed the realm. Then came the Great War, and the Battle of Ashen Fields, and the end of everything the Karaths had built. Now the fields lie fallow, the villages stand half-empty, and something terrible is waking in the mass graves where thirty thousand soldiers were buried. House Karath endures in their black-walled city of Chernogrod, nursing hatred and making bargains they should not make.

## Classification

### Type
**Region Type:** Political (a defeated province under punitive occupation—officially)

### Scale
**Size:** Medium

**Approximate Area:** Roughly 15% of Eldermyr's landmass, though much is now uninhabitable

### Location
**Continent:** Eldermyr

**Position:** Southern (inland, bounded by sea to the south)

## Physical Geography

### Terrain
**Dominant Terrain:** Scarred farmland and dead fields

**Key Features:**
- [[The Ashen Fields]] (Pepelishte) — The cursed battlefield, miles of gray earth and mass graves
- The Chorna River valley, once fertile, now increasingly blighted
- [[The Bitter Coast]] — Rocky, unwelcoming southern shore
- Dead orchards and abandoned farms throughout

### Boundaries
| Direction | Border | Type |
|-----------|--------|------|
| North | [[The Crown Lands]] | Political (Ash Road) |
| South | [[The Bitter Coast]] / Sea | Natural (coast) |
| East | [[The Eastern March]] | Political (disputed) |
| West | Sea | Natural (coast) |

### Climate
**Climate Type:** Temperate (increasingly corrupted)

**Seasons:**
- Winters feel colder than they should
- Springs bring no renewal near the Fields
- Summers are dry and dusty
- Autumn harvests fail more often than not

**Weather Patterns:**
- Unnatural mist rising from the Ashen Fields
- The sky seems perpetually overcast near the curse
- Crops wither even with adequate rain
- Animals sense wrongness and flee

### Water Features
**Rivers:**
- [[The Chorna]] — "The Black River," flows through the region; runs gray near the Fields
- Several tributaries, most now polluted or running low

**Lakes:**
- Mrtvoe Lake — "Dead Lake," fish no longer live here
- What were once irrigation ponds, now stagnant

**Coastline:** The Bitter Coast — rocky, treacherous, few harbors, few visitors

### Natural Resources
| Resource | Abundance | Locations |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Farmland | Formerly abundant, now blighted | Throughout |
| Fish | Declining | Coastal, river |
| Iron | Limited | Northern foothills |
| Stone | Moderate | Chernogrod quarries |

## Settlements

### Capital/Major City
**Name:** [[Chernogrod]]
**Population:** ~35,000 (was 60,000 before the war)
**Role:** Seat of House Karath, last major holdout, fortress of resentment

### Other Cities
| City | Population | Notable For |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Ravnograd | ~8,000 | Fading trade town, increasingly abandoned |
| Volkovka | ~5,000 | Fishing village turned refuge for displaced farmers |

### Towns & Villages
- Pepelishte Village — Abandoned, too close to the Fields
- Numerous ghost villages, their inhabitants fled or dead
- A few stubborn communities clinging to existence

### Ruins & Abandoned Places
- Dozens of abandoned villages and farms
- The Ash Road south of Crossford is lined with empty settlements
- The Fields themselves are one vast ruin of human hope
- Karath family estates, once grand, now crumbling

## Demographics

### Population
**Total:** ~180,000 (down from 400,000 before the Great War)
**Density:** Sparse (concentrated in Chernogrod and coastal areas)

### Peoples
| Group | Percentage | Region |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Karath folk | 85% | Throughout |
| Refugees from the Fields | 10% | Coastal towns |
| Crown Lands overseers | 3% | Official positions |
| Foreigners (rare) | 2% | Coastal |

### Languages
**Common:** The King's Tongue (with heavy regional accent)
**Regional:** Old Karathi (Slavic-influenced, used in curses and laments)

### Social Structure
The Karath Reach's social structure has collapsed. Noble families lost their estates in the war or the curse. Peasants lost their farms. Everyone lost someone. The old hierarchies remain on paper, but in practice, survivors cling together regardless of birth. Lord Draven Karath rules through shared grievance more than feudal obligation—they are all victims together, united in hatred of those who defeated and abandoned them.

## Government & Politics

### Political Status
**Type:** Defeated Province (stripped of rights, under punitive oversight—in theory)

### Ruling Authority
**Ruler:** [[Lord Draven Karath]]
**Title:** Lord of the Karath Reach (restored after 15 years of direct crown rule)
**Seat of Power:** [[Chernogrod]] (the Black Keep)

### Government Structure
After the Great War, House Karath was stripped of titles and the Reach was ruled directly by crown-appointed governors. Aldric II restored the Karaths fifteen years ago as a reconciliation gesture, but with limited powers and heavy taxes. In practice, Lord Draven has slowly reclaimed authority as the curse makes the region ungovernable by outsiders. Crown officials have a way of disappearing. The Karaths rule through local loyalty and shared trauma.

### Laws & Justice
Notable legal traditions:
- Crown law officially applies, but enforcement is spotty
- The Karath folk have their own traditions of blood-payment and community justice
- Trials for crimes against crown officials tend to produce mysterious acquittals
- The dead have no rights—but disturbing them is increasingly dangerous

### External Relations
| Neighbor | Relationship | Issues |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| [[The Crown Lands]] | Hostile | They defeated and humiliated the Karaths |
| [[The Western Shore]] | Hostile | Valdren gold paid for the war |
| [[The Eastern March]] | Hostile | Thorne soldiers burned Karath lands |
| The Rising Dead | ??? | Draven is bargaining with something terrible |

## Economy

### Primary Industries
| Industry | Importance | Locations |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Agriculture | Formerly dominant, now failing | Unblighted areas only |
| Fishing | Growing | Coastal communities |
| Survival | Primary occupation | Throughout |
| Salvage | Grim but necessary | Abandoned areas |

### Trade
**Exports:**
- Little of value (formerly: grain, livestock, timber)
- Some fish from the coast
- Salvage from abandoned settlements

**Imports:**
- Grain (desperately needed)
- Medicine (plague and curse-sickness are common)
- Hope (not available at any price)

**Trade Partners:**
- Crown Lands (grudgingly, for food)
- The coast trades with anyone who will come

### Trade Routes
Major paths through or to the region:
- [[The Ash Road]] — Abandoned south of Crossford, unsafe
- Coastal shipping (limited, most captains avoid the Bitter Coast)
- Black market routes to Chernogrod

### Wealth
**Prosperity:** Poor (devastated, declining further)

**Distribution:** Everyone is poor here. The nobles are poor in gold but rich in land no one wants. The peasants are poor in everything. The only wealth is spite, and the Karaths have plenty.

## Culture

### Regional Identity
The Karath folk define themselves by what was taken from them. They remember when their fields fed the realm, when their lords were respected, when their children had futures. Now they remember the dead, nurse their grudges, and endure. Outsiders see them as bitter and broken; they see themselves as the only ones with the courage to remember the truth.

### Traditions
- Lamenting the Dead — Songs and rituals for the fallen, performed constantly
- The Black Fast — Periodic fasts commemorating the war's starvation
- Blood Memory — Children taught the names of all relatives who died
- The Grudge Stone — Where wrongs are carved in stone to never be forgotten

### Festivals
| Festival | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| The Day of Ashes | Anniversary of the Battle | Mourning for the thirty thousand |
| First Freeze | Autumn | Preparing for winter, sharing scarce resources |
| The Naming | Spring | Reciting the names of the dead |

### Religion
**Dominant Faith:** [[The Faith of the Three]] (Orthodox, but increasingly desperate)

**Other Faiths:**
- The Faith is questioned—why did the Three allow this?
- Old superstitions resurging
- Dark whispers of other powers that might answer prayers the Three ignore

**Sacred Sites:**
- The Cathedral of Sorrows (Chernogrod) — Where the faithful pray for deliverance
- The mass graves at the Ashen Fields — Should be holy, are not
- Countless wayside shrines to the war dead

### Art & Architecture
Regional styles:
- Onion-domed churches and fortified manor houses
- Black stone construction (Chernogrod is named for it)
- Funerary art dominating all other forms
- Music characterized by minor keys and lament

## History

### Origins
The Karath Reach was settled by eastern peoples who crossed the mountains centuries before unification. They built a distinctive culture blending their heritage with the realm they joined. When Eldermyr unified, the Karaths were loyal supporters—until the Mad King rose, and they made the fatal choice to stay loyal.

### Key Events
| Era | Event | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 600 years ago | Settlement by the Karath people | Distinctive culture established |
| 500 years ago | Unification under the Crown | Karaths become loyal vassals |
| 27 years ago | Rise of the Mad King | Karaths initially support strong rule |
| 23 years ago | The Great War | Karaths fight for the Mad King, are destroyed |
| 23 years ago | Battle of Ashen Fields | 30,000 dead, including the Mad King |
| After the war | Punitive occupation | Karath stripped of titles, lands redistributed |
| 8 years ago | Restoration of House Karath | Aldric II's reconciliation gesture |
| 3 months ago | Death of Aldric II | Draven Karath sees his chance |
| Present | The Dead Rise | Something awakens in the Ashen Fields |

### Former Rulers
Previous powers that controlled this region:
- House Karath (for 600 years, until the war)
- Crown-appointed governors (for 15 years after the war)
- House Karath restored (last 8 years, with limited power)

### Recent History
Lord Draven Karath was a boy when the war ended, old enough to remember his father being executed and his family's lands being carved up. He pretended to accept defeat for twenty years, married as the crown demanded, paid taxes that bled his people dry. When Aldric II restored his title, Draven said all the right things. In secret, he has been building connections to the power beneath the Ashen Fields—because he would rather bargain with darkness than kneel to those who destroyed his world.

## Dangers

### Creatures
Dangerous fauna and monsters:
- The Risen — Dead soldiers from the Great War, still fighting
- Plague-wolves — Diseased wolves driven mad by the curse
- Carrion birds in unnatural numbers

### Environmental Hazards
- Curse-sickness — Prolonged exposure to the Fields causes wasting
- Blighted crops — Plants near the curse wither or grow wrong
- Poisoned water — The Chorna runs gray, unsafe to drink
- Miasma — Fog from the Fields that brings nightmares

### Hostile Forces
Bandits, enemies, dark powers:
- Desperate survivors turned to banditry
- Crown soldiers enforcing punitive taxes
- Agents of rival houses exploiting the chaos
- **The Unnamed** — Whatever Draven Karath has been bargaining with

### Forbidden Areas
Places people avoid:
- [[The Ashen Fields]] (Pepelishte) — Where the dead rise
- The heart of the curse — Even the risen avoid certain spots
- Abandoned villages too close to the Fields — Silent, waiting

## Secrets

1. **Draven Karath has made contact with the Unnamed.** The thing beneath the Ashen Fields has promised to give him an army of the dead—if he feeds it enough souls.

2. **The Mad King's crown survived.** It lies at the heart of the Ashen Fields, and the figure people see wearing it is not a ghost—it's something wearing the king's form.

3. **Lady Mira knows what her husband is doing.** She is secretly corresponding with Lord Varic Valdren, willing to betray Draven to save herself and her children.

4. **The curse is spreading faster than anyone admits.** The crown's reports are falsified. By year's end, the blight will reach Crossford. By next year, Aldersgate.

5. **There were survivors at the center of the Fields.** Soldiers who were buried alive in the mass graves but didn't die. They've been down there for twenty-three years. They are not entirely human anymore.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Diplomat's Mission:** Lord Varic Valdren hires the party to negotiate with Draven Karath—or assess whether he's a threat that needs to be eliminated.

2. **The Mourning Women:** The professional lamenters have stopped singing. They say the dead no longer want to be mourned. What does that mean?

3. **The Crown's Agent:** A crown official went to investigate the curse and vanished. The party is hired to find out what happened—and why the locals aren't talking.

4. **The Heart of the Fields:** Someone needs to reach the center of the Ashen Fields, where the Mad King fell, and retrieve something that lies there. No one has ever returned from that journey.

5. **Lady Mira's Offer:** Lady Karath secretly contacts the party. She will give them evidence of Draven's dark bargains—if they can get her and her children to safety.

## Notes
- Use Slavic/Eastern European naming conventions (harder consonants, Cyrillic-inspired)
- The Karath Reach should feel bleak, resentful, and haunted
- This is ground zero for the supernatural threat
- The Karaths are villains—but sympathetic ones, driven to darkness by genuine wrongs
