# The King's Road

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a road, create a travel route that connects places and peoples. Include its construction, the terrain it crosses, the dangers along it, and the settlements it serves. Roads should feel like vital arteries of civilization—or forgotten paths into danger.

## Overview
The King's Road is the spine of Eldermyr—a paved highway connecting the capital of [[Eldoria]] to both the agricultural east and the mercantile west. Built by royal decree five centuries ago, the road remains the kingdom's primary artery for trade, military movement, and communication. Stone milestones bearing the royal seal mark every league, and generations of travelers have worn the cobblestones smooth. In the succession crisis, the King's Road has become a contested prize: whoever controls the road controls the flow of grain from [[The Warden's March]], goods from [[Corvana]], and troops to any battlefield.

## Classification

### Type
**Road Type:** King's Road / Imperial Highway

### Scale
**Length:** 180 miles total (90 miles east to Thornholt, 90 miles west to the coast)
**Width:** Wide Highway (three wagons abreast on main sections)

### Condition
**Current State:** Well-Maintained (Crown Lands section) / Adequate (Eastern March) / Deteriorating (Western approaches — conflict damage)

**Surface:** Paved (dressed stone on major sections) / Cobbled (towns and bridges) / Gravel (minor branches)

## Route

### Endpoints
**Start:** [[Eldoria]], the capital (or center point)
**End:** [[Thornholt]] (Eastern Branch) / Port Valdren coast (Western Branch)

### Major Waypoints
| Location | Distance From Eldoria | Notable For |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| The Royal Mile | 0 miles | Processional way through capital |
| Kingsford Bridge | 15 miles east | Major river crossing |
| The Crossroads Inn | 30 miles east | Junction with northern routes |
| Millford | 55 miles east | Market town; Warden's March |
| [[Thornholt]] | 90 miles east | Eastern terminus; Thorne capital |
| [[The Shepherd's Teeth]] Pass | 25 miles west | Hill crossing |
| Port Valdren | 80 miles west | Coastal terminus |

### Route Description
From Eldoria's Royal Gate, the King's Road descends to the shore of [[The Silvermere]], follows its southeastern bank before crossing [[The Kingswater]] at Kingsford Bridge, then climbs gradually through rolling farmland to Thornholt in the east. The western branch skirts the northern lake shore, climbs through [[The Shepherd's Teeth]], and descends to the coastal lowlands. The road is remarkably straight where terrain permits, a testament to its royal engineering.

### Terrain Crossed
| Section | Terrain | Difficulty |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Eldoria to Kingsford | Lakeside lowland | Easy |
| Kingsford to Millford | Rolling farmland | Easy |
| Millford to Thornholt | Open plains | Easy |
| Eldoria to Shepherd's Teeth | Hills and forest edge | Moderate |
| Shepherd's Teeth to coast | Descent through hills | Moderate |

### Alternative Routes
Other paths between the same points:
- The Kingswater (river route to sea; slower but avoids tolls)
- The Drover's Track (parallel farm road; longer but less patrolled)
- Forest paths through [[The King's Wood]] (dangerous; avoided)

## Construction

### Origin
The King's Road was commissioned by King Aldric the Builder 500 years ago to unite his newly consolidated realm. The original construction took 30 years and the labor of thousands. It replaced a patchwork of dirt tracks with the first true highway in Eldermyr's history.

### Engineering
**Construction Method:** Roman-style road building — excavated bed, layered foundation, crowned surface
**Materials:** Local stone (dressed limestone), river gravel, sand
**Notable Features:**
- Stone milestones every league
- Drainage ditches on both sides
- Reinforced foundations at stream crossings
- Original bridge pilings still in use at some crossings

### Maintenance
Who maintains the road?
- Crown Road Wardens (traditionally; now reduced)
- Local lords responsible for sections in their territory
- House Thorne maintains the eastern section well
- Western section increasingly neglected due to conflict

### Repairs Needed
Current problems:
- Western hill section suffering from conflict damage
- Several bridges need reinforcement
- Milestones vandalized or stolen in some areas
- Drainage clogged in places; water damage beginning

## Secrets

1. King Aldric the Builder discovered pre-human roads beneath the surface and built sections of the King's Road directly over them; certain milestones are actually seals keeping something below contained
2. The Lonely Mile's disappearances are caused by a portal that occasionally opens to the Shadowfell; victims don't die—they're taken
3. House Thorne has secretly been diverting road maintenance funds for years, building a hidden military road through the Thornwood instead

## Plot Hooks

1. A merchant caravan has disappeared on the Lonely Mile; the merchant guild hires the party to investigate and retrieve valuable cargo
2. Both factions want the party to secure Tooth Gate—but each offers different inducements and the garrison may have their own plans
3. An ancient milestone has cracked, and strange sounds emerge from below; whatever Aldric sealed is stirring

## Notes
The King's Road represents both the unity and the fracturing of Eldermyr. Built to bind the kingdom together, it now serves as a contested resource in its division. Control of the road means control of trade, communication, and military movement—making it perhaps the most strategically important geographic feature in the succession crisis.
