# The King's Wood

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The King's Wood is the ancient royal hunting preserve of [[The Crown Lands]]—a manicured wilderness where kings have hunted for centuries. Unlike the wild [[Myrkvid]] or martial [[The Thornwood]], this forest is civilized, maintained, and full of political significance. Use English/French Medieval naming conventions. The tone should be elegant but with hidden darkness.

## Overview
The King's Wood stretches across the northern reaches of [[The Crown Lands]], a vast forest that has been the private preserve of Eldermyr's monarchs for five centuries. Unlike the wild forests of [[The Northlands]] or the martial [[The Thornwood]], the King's Wood is a managed landscape—trails maintained, lodges appointed, game stocks carefully controlled. Every autumn, the great nobles gather here for the Royal Hunt, cementing alliances and settling scores in the ancient tradition of the chase. But beneath its civilized surface, the King's Wood holds secrets: pre-unification ruins that no one discusses, sections where even royal foresters fear to walk, and rumors of something that lived here long before any human king claimed the land.

## Classification

## History

### Origin
The King's Wood was ancient forest when the first kings claimed it. Five centuries ago, the founding monarch declared it royal preserve, protecting it from clearance that consumed surrounding woodland. The forest has been maintained ever since—but maintained doesn't mean understood. The Old Palace was already a ruin then. The Deep Wood was already avoided.

### Ancient History
What happened here long ago?
- Pre-unification: Something lived here; built the Old Palace
- Early kings found the ruins; declared them forbidden
- The forest was larger; surrounding areas cleared for farms
- Whatever lived here may still be present

### Major Events
| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Royal Declaration | ~500 years ago | Forest becomes protected preserve |
| The First Hunt | ~500 years ago | Tradition established |
| The Old Palace Incident | ~400 years ago | Area sealed; records destroyed |
| The Great Hunt tradition | 300 years ago | Formalized annual event |
| [[High King Aldric II]]'s last hunt | 1 year ago | Political significance |

### Changes Over Time
The managed areas have become more civilized over centuries. The lodges grow grander; the trails better maintained. But the Deep Wood remains untouched, and the Old Palace stands as it always has—waiting.

## Magical Nature

Officially, the King's Wood is mundane. The Crown maintains this position firmly. However:

### Enchantments
- The boundary stones may be warded (poachers claim invisible barriers)
- The Heartwood Oak is said to be tied to the Crown's fortunes
- The forest "knows" when the king enters

### Curses
- The Old Palace area is definitely cursed; everyone who's explored has died or gone mad
- Some hunting accidents seem too convenient; political rivals die cleanly

### Fey Presence
- Denied officially
- The Deep Wood has characteristics of Fey-touched forest
- Some yews are impossibly old; perhaps not entirely in this world

### Magical Effects
- Near the Old Palace: Magic behaves strangely; divination fails; conjurations go wrong
- The Deep Wood: Similar but less intense
- Elsewhere: Normal

## Cultural Significance

### To Locals
The King's Wood is the Crown's forest—a symbol of royal power and continuity. Commoners are excluded except as servants. For nobles, an invitation to the Royal Hunt is the highest honor. The forest represents everything about the social order: the King owns nature itself, and all hunt by his permission.

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- **[[The Faith of the Three]]:** The forest chapel honors the Warden
- **Hunting rites:** Prayers before hunts; thanksgiving after
- **The Heartwood Oak:** Some believe it's blessed; others fear it

### In Folklore
Stories and legends:
- **The White Hart** — Appears to announce destiny; never killed
- **The Black Fox** — Seen before kings die
- **The Old Palace Ghost** — A queen who refused to leave
- **The Hunt That Never Ended** — A cursed hunt still riding through the forest

### Names
What is the forest called and why?
- **The King's Wood** — Belongs to the Crown; simple and direct
- **The Royal Forest** — Formal name
- **The Crown's Garden** — Poetic; emphasizes management
- **That Which Was Here Before** — Old forester name; significant

## Current Situation

### Territorial Control
Who claims the forest?
- **The Crown** — Absolute ownership
- **[[Lord Varic Valdren]]** — As regent, controls access
- **Disputed:** Does the regency include the forest? Noble question

### Threats
Current dangers:
- Poaching increased during succession crisis
- Political factions holding secret meetings in the lodges
- Something in the Deep Wood has been more active recently
- The Old Palace area: lights seen; sounds heard

### Conflicts
Disputes over the forest:
- [[House Thorne]] traditionally hosted at the Great Hunt; will [[Lord Varic Valdren|Valdren]] continue?
- Hunt invitations are political weapons; snubs cause feuds
- The foresters are worried; they report strange things; nobles don't listen

### Conservation
Efforts to protect or exploit:
- The forest is well-maintained as hunting preserve
- The Deep Wood remains untouched (by policy or fear)
- [[Lord Varic Valdren]] has discussed opening timber rights; foresters horrified

## Key Figures

- **The Old Palace's Occupants** — Unknown; pre-date human history

## Secrets

1. **The Old Palace contains something still alive.** Not human, not dead, but aware. It's been there since before humans came to Eldermyr. The founding king learned to leave it alone. Every king since has been told: maintain the forest, never enter the Palace. [[High King Aldric II]] broke that rule before he died. What he found disturbed him deeply.

2. **The White Hart appeared to [[Edric Valdren]] last year.** The boy saw it during a hunt and told no one except his grandfather, who dismissed it as fancy. But the White Hart appears to those destined for great things—or great tragedy.

3. **Something in the Deep Wood is connected to [[Myrkvid]].** The forests were once one; the clearing between them is artificial. What lives in the Deep Wood has kin in the northern forest. The Old Ways practitioners know this. The Crown doesn't.

4. **[[Lord Varic Valdren]] plans to log the Old Palace area.** He doesn't believe the warnings. He sees valuable timber and land. The foresters are terrified. If he proceeds, whatever sleeps there will wake.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Old Palace Mystery:** [[High King Aldric II]] visited the Old Palace ruins before his death. He took something—or something followed him out. The party must investigate what's there and what connection it has to his death.

2. **The White Hart Hunt:** [[Edric Valdren]] hires the party secretly to help him find the White Hart again. He needs to know what destiny it heralds. The hunt takes them deeper into the forest than any noble has gone.

3. **The Logging Rights:** [[Lord Varic Valdren]] wants the Old Palace area cleared. He hires the party to survey it first. What they find threatens to wake something ancient. Do they report the truth and risk his anger, or help him make a terrible mistake?

4. **The Great Hunt:** This year's Royal Hunt becomes political battleground. Someone is planning to assassinate a noble during the chaos. The party must prevent murder while navigating forest and politics.

5. **The Deep Wood Connection:** [[The Spirit-Speakers]] contact the party with disturbing news: whatever is waking in [[The Ashen Fields]] is affecting the Deep Wood. The forests are connected. The curse is spreading underground. They need outsiders to investigate without alerting the Crown.

**Prompt:**
> Deep within the King's Wood, ancient royal oaks rising majestically with massive trunks and spreading canopies. Dappled golden sunlight filtering through autumn leaves in shades of red and gold. A maintained trail winds through the trees, bordered by low holly hedges. A red deer stag stands alert in a shaft of light, magnificent antlers crowned with leaves. The forest floor is clear of undergrowth, carpet of fallen leaves in rich colors. A noble hunting party visible in the distance. The scene conveys managed wilderness, royal privilege, and the beauty of an autumn forest preserve.

### Forest Edge or Clearing
**Prompt:**
> The Royal Glade in the King's Wood, a grand ceremonial clearing where the Great Hunt begins. Noble pavilions in royal purple and gold line the edges. A hunting party assembles—lords and ladies on horseback, hounds straining at leashes, servants with provisions. The Heartwood Oak dominates the scene, impossibly large and ancient, its canopy spreading over the entire clearing. Morning mist lingers at ground level. Sunlight breaks through clouds dramatically. In the distance, the dark mass of the Deep Wood is visible—notably no one faces that direction. The scene captures tradition, privilege, and the hidden unease beneath noble pageantry.
