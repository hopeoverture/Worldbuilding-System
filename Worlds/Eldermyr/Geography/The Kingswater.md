# The Kingswater

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Kingswater is the lifeblood of Eldermyr—the great river that connects the northern mountains to the western sea, passing through the capital and the realm's most fertile lands. It should feel vital, busy, and central to the kingdom's identity.

## Overview
The Kingswater is the mightiest river in Eldermyr, flowing 350 miles from the glaciers of [[The Greycrowns]] through the heart of [[The Crown Lands]] to the sea. It is the realm's primary artery of trade, the source of water for the most fertile farmland, and the reason [[Aldersgate]] stands where it does. Generations of kings have been crowned on its banks, treaties signed on its bridges, and battles fought for control of its crossings. To control the Kingswater is to control the heartland of Eldermyr—a fact that has not escaped the attention of the great houses as they circle each other in the current crisis.

## Classification

### Type
**River Type:** Major River (the largest in Eldermyr)

### Scale
**Length:** ~350 miles from glacier to sea
**Width:** 100-200 feet (upper), 300-500 feet at [[Aldersgate]], up to 800 feet at mouth
**Depth:** 6-12 feet (upper navigable), 15-30 feet at [[Aldersgate]], 40+ feet at mouth

### Character
**Flow:** Variable — swift in mountains, moderate through plains, slow and tidal near mouth
**Water:** Clear in upper reaches, silty through farmlands, brackish near sea

## Course

### Source
**Location:** Hrímjökull Glacier, [[The Greycrowns]]
**Type:** Glacier
**Description:** The Kingswater begins as meltwater from Hrímjökull, the great glacier below Vindrtind. In spring and summer, the glacier weeps torrents of ice-cold water that gather in mountain streams before tumbling down through [[The Northlands]] to become the river. The Northfolk consider the source sacred—the glacier's gift to the realm below.

### Upper Course
**Character:** Swift, cold, clear; rocky rapids and waterfalls
**Terrain Passed:** [[The Greycrowns]] foothills, [[The Northlands]], [[Myrkvid]] edges
**Notable Features:**
- **Hrímfoss (Frost Falls)** — 80-foot waterfall marking transition from mountains to foothills
- **The Narrows** — Gorge where river cuts through rock; impossible to navigate
- **Kingsbridge** — First major crossing; head of navigation

### Middle Course
**Character:** Moderate flow, wide and navigable; rich floodplain
**Terrain Passed:** Northern [[The Crown Lands]], past [[Aldersgate]]
**Notable Features:**
- **Crownmere** — Large lake fed by the river east of [[Aldersgate]]; royal retreats
- **The Kingswater Bridge** — Great bridge at [[Aldersgate]]; largest in the realm
- **Millbrook Rapids** — Gentle rapids powering dozens of mills
- **The King's Reach** — 50-mile stretch of calm water ideal for barges

### Lower Course
**Character:** Slow, wide, tidal influence; marshlands at edges
**Terrain Passed:** Southern [[The Crown Lands]], approaching [[The Western Shore]]
**Notable Features:**
- **The Fens** — Marshland where river spreads; difficult to navigate
- **Rivermouth** — Where Kingswater meets [[The Valdris]] before entering the sea
- **The Bar** — Sandbar at the mouth; requires pilots to cross safely

### Mouth
**Location:** [[The Trader's Sea]], near Porto Valdris influence
**Type:** Estuary
**Description:** The Kingswater empties into [[The Trader's Sea]] through a broad estuary where fresh and salt water mix. The mouth is controlled by sandbars that shift with the seasons, requiring experienced pilots. The town of Rivermouth guards the entrance, theoretically loyal to the Crown but practically dependent on [[House Valdren]]'s goodwill.

### Tributaries
| Tributary | Joins At | Size | Notable For |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| [[The Valdris]] | Rivermouth | Major | Trade route to [[Porto Valdris]]; Valdren-controlled |
| Northwood streams | Upper course | Minor | Numerous; drain [[Myrkvid]] |
| Crownmere outflow | East of [[Aldersgate]] | Moderate | Lake drainage |
| The Millbrook | Millbrook | Minor | Powers grain mills |

## Physical Features

### Rapids & Falls
| Name | Location | Height/Class |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Hrímfoss (Frost Falls) | Upper course | 80-foot waterfall |
| The Narrows | Below Hrímfoss | Class V rapids (impassable) |
| Millbrook Rapids | Middle course | Class II (navigable with skill) |

### Islands
River islands:
- **King's Isle** — At [[Aldersgate]]; site of the royal palace
- **Crownmere Islands** — Several in the lake; summer retreats for nobility
- **The Fens islands** — Countless small marshy islands; refuge for outlaws

### Fords & Shallows
Natural crossing points:
- **Kingsbridge Ford** — Ancient crossing before the bridge was built; still usable in dry summers
- **Fairfield Ford** — Seasonal crossing for cattle drives
- **The Shoals** — Shallow area in lower course; barges run aground here regularly

### Deep Pools
- **The King's Pool** — Below the bridge at [[Aldersgate]]; 40+ feet deep; where royal barges anchor
- **Crownmere Deeps** — Parts of the lake are over 100 feet deep; rumored to hide secrets
- **The Drowned Hole** — In The Fens; unnaturally deep; local legend says it's bottomless

### Floodplains
Areas that flood:
- The entire middle course floods most springs, depositing rich silt
- [[Aldersgate]] has extensive flood walls after the Great Flood of 127 years ago
- The Fens are permanent floodplain; villages built on stilts

### Deltas/Wetlands
- **The Fens** — Vast marshland in lower course; home to fisher-folk and fugitives
- **The Rivermouth Marshes** — Where fresh and salt water meet; rich in wildlife

## Hydrology

### Flow Rate
**Volume:** Approximately 15,000 cubic feet per second at [[Aldersgate]] (average); doubles in spring melt
**Seasonal Variation:** Highest in late spring (glacier melt), lowest in late winter

### Flooding
**Flood Season:** Late spring (typically fifth month)
**Severity:** Moderate most years; severe once per decade
**Historical Floods:**
- The Great Flood (127 years ago) — Destroyed Old Aldersgate; led to current flood walls
- The Year of Tears (52 years ago) — Villages washed away; thousands died
- The Battle Flood (during [[The Great War]]) — Helped defend [[Aldersgate]] from siege

### Droughts
Low water periods:
- Late winter before melt begins
- Occasional dry summers reduce flow enough to strand barges
- Crownmere acts as a reservoir, moderating drought effects

### Water Quality
- Upper course: Pure glacial water; cold, clean, slightly mineral
- Middle course: Good; some agricultural runoff; drinkable with caution
- Lower course: Brackish near mouth; requires boiling; The Fens water is suspect

## Navigation

### Navigability
**Navigable Sections:** Kingsbridge to the sea (~280 miles)
**Boat Types:** Flat-bottomed barges (most common), river galleys (fast), fishing boats (local), royal barges (ceremonial)
**Obstacles:**
- Millbrook Rapids (require skilled pilots)
- The Shoals (lower course; seasonal hazard)
- The Bar (river mouth; requires pilots)
- The Fens (maze of channels; easy to get lost)

### Ports & Landings
| Port | Location | Size | Trade |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| [[Aldersgate]] Royal Harbor | [[Aldersgate]] | Large | Everything |
| Kingsbridge Landing | Kingsbridge | Medium | Northern goods, timber |
| [[Crossford]] Wharf | [[Crossford]] | Medium | Agricultural goods |
| Millbrook Quay | Millbrook | Small | Grain, flour |
| Rivermouth | River mouth | Medium | Transshipment to sea vessels |

### River Traffic
What travels the river?
- **Upstream:** Luxury goods, wine, spices, cloth from the coast
- **Downstream:** Grain, timber, iron, wool from the interior
- **Local:** Fishing boats, ferries, patrol vessels
- **Royal:** The king's barge (unused since [[High King Aldric II]]'s death)

### Crossings
| Crossing | Type | Location | Controller |
|----------|------|----------|------------|

## Settlements

### Major Cities
Cities on the river:
- **[[Aldersgate]]** — The capital; built around King's Isle; 120,000 people
- **[[Crossford]]** — Major market town at road junction; 25,000 people

### Towns

- **Fairfield** — Market town; seasonal population surge; ~4,000

### River Communities
Villages dependent on the river:
- Dozens of fishing villages along the entire course
- The Fens folk — Marsh-dwellers who live on the water
- Mill villages at every point where the current can turn a wheel

## Economy

### Trade Route
The Kingswater is Eldermyr's main commercial artery, carrying more goods than all roads combined. Grain from [[The Crown Lands]] flows downstream to feed the coastal cities; luxury goods flow upstream to the capital and beyond. Control of river traffic means control of the realm's economy—which is why the great houses watch the river tolls with jealous eyes.

### Goods Transported
| Good | Direction | Volume |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Grain | Downstream | High — feeds coastal population |
| Timber | Downstream | Moderate — from [[The Northlands]] |
| Iron | Downstream | Moderate — from [[The Greycrowns]] mines |
| Wine & luxuries | Upstream | Moderate — from [[The Western Shore]] |
| Cloth & spices | Upstream | Moderate — foreign imports |
| Wool | Downstream | Moderate — to coastal weavers |

### Fishing
**Species:**
- River trout (upper course)
- Carp, perch, pike (middle course)
- Salmon (seasonal runs)
- Eels (lower course; considered a delicacy)

**Industry:** Fishing supports thousands of families; the Fishers' Guild is powerful in [[Aldersgate]]; smoked fish is exported throughout the realm.

### Other Industries
Mills, irrigation, mining:
- **Mills** — Grain mills at every rapids; flour is a major export
- **Irrigation** — The middle course waters the most productive farmland in Eldermyr
- **Ice harvest** — Upper course ice cut in winter, stored for summer sale
- **Reed harvesting** — The Fens provide thatching material for the entire region

### Tolls & Tariffs
Who collects payment for river use?
- **The Crown** — Official tolls collected at [[Aldersgate]] and Kingsbridge
- **[[House Valdren]]** — Controls Rivermouth; takes "pilot fees" that function as tariffs
- **Local lords** — Minor tolls at various crossings
- **The Fishers' Guild** — License fees for commercial fishing

## Ecology

### Fish & Aquatic Life
| Species | Abundance | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| River trout | Common (upper) | Prized eating; protected in royal waters |
| Salmon | Seasonal | Spring runs; celebrated with festivals |
| Carp | Abundant (middle) | Staple food fish |
| Eels | Common (lower) | Delicacy; Fens specialty |
| River mussels | Moderate | Occasional pearls found |

### Riverside Flora
- Willows and alders lining banks
- Water lilies in calm stretches
- Reeds and rushes in The Fens (economic resource)
- Orchards and farms along the fertile floodplain

### Wildlife
Animals dependent on the river:
- Waterfowl (ducks, geese, herons) — hunted for food
- Otters — fur valuable; protected near Crownmere
- Beavers — upper course; their dams affect water flow
- Kingfishers — considered good luck by fisher-folk

### Monsters
Dangerous river creatures:
- **Giant pike** — Rare; large enough to capsize small boats; The Fens especially
- **The Crownmere Serpent** — Legendary; sightings reported for centuries; never confirmed
- **Bog things** — Undead that rise in The Fens; worse since [[The Ashen Fields]] awakened

## Political Significance

### As a Boundary
The Kingswater has historically united rather than divided—it's the realm's spine, not a border. However, the river does mark the western edge of direct Crown authority; beyond Rivermouth, [[House Valdren]]'s influence dominates. The Fens have always been a lawless buffer zone, and control of the river crossings has been contested in every civil conflict.

### Territorial Control
Who controls the river?
| Section | Controller | Rights |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Source to Kingsbridge | Northfolk clans (nominal Crown) | Crown claims, locals ignore |
| Kingsbridge to [[Aldersgate]] | The Crown directly | Full control; tolls collected |
| [[Aldersgate]] to The Fens | Crown Lands lords | Local lords manage; Crown oversees |
| The Fens | No one effectively | Theoretically Crown; practically ungoverned |
| Rivermouth to sea | [[House Valdren]] (de facto) | "Pilot fees" control access |

### Disputes
River-related conflicts:
- [[House Valdren]] effectively controls access to the sea; other houses resent this
- Fens folk owe allegiance to no one; frequently accused of piracy
- Bridge tolls at [[Aldersgate]] fund the Crown; raising them is politically explosive
- Water rights disputes between upstream and downstream farmers

### Treaties
Agreements about river use:
- **The River Compact** (300 years ago) — Established free navigation for all Eldermyr subjects
- **The Valdren Accord** (150 years ago) — [[House Valdren]] permitted to charge pilot fees at Rivermouth
- **The Fishers' Charter** (200 years ago) — Guaranteed fishing rights; created the Guild

## Cultural Significance

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- **[[The Faith of the Three]]:** The river is seen as the Shepherd's gift—providing for the people
- **Baptism site:** New converts baptized in the Kingswater at [[Thornhall]]
- **Funeral barges:** Important figures' ashes scattered on the river
- **The Old Ways:** The Northfolk consider the source sacred; the glacier gives life to the realm

### In Folklore
Stories and legends:
- **The River King** — Spirit said to rule the waters; must be appeased for safe passage
- **The Crownmere Serpent** — Monster in the lake; appears before disasters
- **The Drowned Queen** — Ghost of an ancient queen who walks the water on moonless nights
- **The Fens Lights** — Will-o'-wisps that lead travelers to their doom

### Traditions
River-related customs:
- **Firstwater Festival** — Celebrating the spring melt; held at Kingsbridge
- **Salmon Run celebrations** — When the fish return
- **River wedding tradition** — Throwing coins into the Kingswater for blessing
- **The King's Passage** — New monarchs travel by barge from [[Aldersgate]] to [[Thornhall]] for coronation

### Names
What is the river called by different peoples?
- **The Kingswater** — Common Tongue; refers to royal importance
- **Hrímá** (Old Tongue) — "Frost River"; Northfolk name
- **The Great River** — Simple descriptive; used by common folk
- **The Royal River** — Poetic; used in formal contexts

## History

### Geological History
The Kingswater carved its course over millions of years, cutting through the landscape as the land rose and the glaciers advanced and retreated. Crownmere formed when a natural dam created by glacial debris blocked a tributary valley. The river's current course has been stable for recorded history.

### Historical Importance
Role in history:
- [[Aldersgate]] was founded because of the river crossing
- Every major conflict has involved control of the river
- Trade along the Kingswater built the wealth that funded unification
- The river carried the armies in [[The Great War]]

### Major Events
| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Founding of [[Aldersgate]] | ~1,000 years ago | Capital established at strategic crossing |
| The Great Flood | 127 years ago | Destroyed old city; led to modern flood defenses |
| The River Compact | 300 years ago | Established free navigation rights |
| [[The Great War]] | 23 years ago | River battles decided the war's outcome |

### Legendary Events
Mythical happenings:
- **The Crossing of Aldric** — The first king supposedly walked across the water
- **The Serpent's Rising** — The Crownmere Serpent reportedly surfaced before [[The Mad King]]'s rise
- **The Battle of the Bridge** — Legendary last stand during a forgotten invasion

## Current Situation

### Health
Environmental condition:
- Upper course: Pristine; glacier-fed and clean
- Middle course: Healthy; some agricultural runoff but manageable
- Lower course: The Fens are increasingly stagnant; something is wrong
- Since [[The Ashen Fields]] awakened, fish have been dying in unusual numbers

### Threats
Current dangers:
- [[House Valdren]]'s control of Rivermouth threatens Crown revenue
- The Fens are becoming more dangerous; more bog-dead reported
- If civil war erupts, the river bridges will be the first targets
- Something is poisoning the lower course; possibly related to the curse spreading

### Development
Changes being made:

- The Fishers' Guild is lobbying for pollution controls
- Some lords are fortifying river crossings in anticipation of conflict

## Key Figures

### River Lords
Those who control sections:
- **Harbormaster Aldric Steele** — Controls [[Aldersgate]] harbor; loyal to whoever sits the throne
- **Lord Willem of Rivermouth** — Controls the river mouth; Valdren puppet
- **The Fens-King** — Legendary title claimed by whoever dominates the marshes; currently contested

### River Folk
Famous inhabitants:
- **Old Marget** — Legendary bargemaiden said to know every shoal and channel
- **Captain Jonas** — Most respected river pilot; can navigate The Fens blindfolded
- **The Eel Queen** — Fens-dwelling woman who controls much of the eel trade

### Legendary Figures
- **The First King** — Supposedly walked across the water
- **The River King** — Spirit of the Kingswater; may or may not be real
- **The Drowned Queen** — Ghost who warns of flood or disaster

## Secrets

1. **The Sunken Tower in Crownmere predates human presence in Eldermyr.** Royal divers have explored it—and found writing in no known language. [[High King Aldric II]] ordered the expeditions sealed in the archives. What he learned disturbed him enough that he never spoke of it.

2. **[[House Valdren]]'s control of Rivermouth is nearly complete.** Lord Willem answers to [[Lord Varic Valdren]], not the Crown. If civil war comes, [[House Valdren]] can starve [[Aldersgate]] by blocking river traffic. The other houses haven't realized how vulnerable this makes them.

3. **Something is poisoning the lower river, and it's not natural.** Fish are dying, the water tastes wrong, and the Fens folk are getting sick. The poison is spreading upstream. It's connected to [[The Ashen Fields]]—the curse is reaching out through the water.

4. **The Fens folk have been negotiating with [[House Karath]].** [[Lord Draven Karath]] has promised them autonomy and recognition if they help him when the time comes. The marshes could become a haven for his forces—or a dagger aimed at [[Aldersgate]]'s supply lines.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Poisoned Water:** Fish are dying and people are getting sick along the lower Kingswater. The party is hired to find the source—which leads them toward [[The Ashen Fields]] and the realization that the curse is spreading through waterways.

2. **The Sunken Tower:** A noble hires the party to retrieve something from the mysterious tower in Crownmere. What they find there is older than Eldermyr—and someone doesn't want it disturbed.

3. **The Fens Alliance:** [[House Thorne]] suspects the Fens folk are dealing with enemies. They need the party to infiltrate the marshes and find out who's buying their loyalty—and what they've promised in return.

4. **River Blockade:** As tensions rise, someone is sinking barges in the river. Is it [[House Valdren]] preparing to strangle [[Aldersgate]], or [[House Thorne]] trying to frame them? The party must investigate before war becomes inevitable.

5. **The River King's Bargain:** An ancient spirit appears to the party during a river crossing. The Kingswater itself is aware of the spreading corruption and offers information—for a price. What does a river want?
