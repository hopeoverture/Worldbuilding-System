# The Northlands

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Northlands are a remote, ancient region where the Old Ways persist alongside the Faith. This region reflects Norse/Celtic naming conventions with nature-names and strong clan identity.

## Overview
The Northlands stretch from the Greycrown Mountains to the northern reaches of the realm, a vast wilderness of ancient forests, frozen lakes, and scattered settlements clinging to hard-won clearings. No single great house rules here—instead, a patchwork of minor lords, clan chiefs, and free villages share power in uneasy balance. The Faith of the Three holds sway in the towns, but in the deep woods, the Old Ways never truly died. Spirit-Speakers commune with ancestors, sacred groves mark places of power, and the dead are honored as guides rather than simply mourned.

## Classification

## Demographics

### Population
**Total:** ~200,000
**Density:** Sparse (most of the region is uninhabited wilderness)

### Peoples
| Group | Percentage | Region |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Northfolk (clans) | 85% | Throughout |
| Crown Lands settlers | 10% | Vindrheim, trade towns |
| Eastern March descent | 3% | Eastern foothills |
| True Wildlings | 2% | Deep woods (rarely seen) |

### Languages
**Common:** The King's Tongue (with heavy northern accent)
**Regional:** The Old Tongue (Norse/Celtic, used in ritual and song)

### Social Structure
The Northlands operate on clan loyalty rather than feudal obligation. Extended families band together under a chief or elder, owing allegiance to no lord beyond their own blood. Vindrheim and the larger towns have adopted southern ways, with appointed lords and tax collectors, but in the forests, the clans live as they always have. This creates constant tension between "civilized" Northfolk and the traditional clans.

## Government & Politics

### Political Status
**Type:** Fragmented (multiple minor lords and clan chiefs, no unified ruler)

### Ruling Authority
**Ruler:** No single ruler; the region is divided among:
- Minor noble houses in the south (sworn to the crown)
- Clan chiefs in the central forests
- Free villages answering to no one
**Seat of Power:** [[Vindrheim]] (informal, for trade and gatherings)

### Government Structure
The Northlands have no unified government. Southern towns pay taxes to minor lords who pay taxes to the crown. Central and northern areas are governed by clan law—disputes settled by elders, crimes punished by the community. Major decisions are made at the Allthing, a gathering of clan chiefs held each summer at Vindrheim. The crown has learned not to push too hard; Northfolk resist outside authority with stubborn silence or, when pushed too far, violence.

### Laws & Justice
Notable legal traditions:
- Weregild — Blood-price paid for killing, scaled to the victim's status
- The Holmgang — Ritual combat to settle disputes
- Outlawry — Exile from all protection, worse than death
- Guest-right — Sacred; harming a guest is an unforgivable crime

### External Relations
| Neighbor | Relationship | Issues |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| [[The Crown Lands]] | Distant | Pay token taxes, mostly ignored |
| [[The Eastern March]] | Neutral | Trade in furs and iron |
| [[The Western Shore]] | Commercial | Trade through Vindrheim |
| The True North | Unknown | What lies beyond the Greycrowns? |

## Economy

### Primary Industries
| Industry | Importance | Locations |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Timber | Major | Throughout |
| Hunting/Trapping | Major | Throughout |
| Fishing | Moderate | Lake and river communities |
| Iron Mining | Moderate | Foothills |

### Trade
**Exports:**
- Timber (the realm's best)
- Furs (highly prized in the south)
- Amber (rare and valuable)
- Ice (shipped south in summer, a luxury)

**Imports:**
- Grain (the North cannot grow enough)
- Metal goods (weapons, tools)
- Salt (essential for preservation)
- Luxuries (for those who want them)

**Trade Partners:**
- Crown Lands (grain for timber)
- Eastern March (iron exchange)
- Western Shore (luxury trade)

### Trade Routes
Major paths through or to the region:
- [[The Northern Way]] — Road from Aldersgate to Vindrheim
- River routes along the Kingswater (seasonal)
- Forest paths known only to locals

### Wealth
**Prosperity:** Poor by southern standards (wealthy in resources, poor in coin)

**Distribution:** The Northlands measure wealth in cattle, furs, and reputation rather than gold. A chief who gives generous gifts is wealthy; a miser with gold is poor. This communal ethic means fewer extremes of wealth, but also limited ability to buy southern goods.

## Culture

### Regional Identity
Northfolk are proud of their hardiness, their traditions, and their independence. They view southerners as soft, decadent, and overly complicated. A Northlander's word is sacred; elaborate contracts are for people who can't be trusted. They honor ancestors, respect the land spirits, and believe the dead watch over the living. This makes them seem primitive to outsiders, but their culture has endured longer than any southern kingdom.

### Traditions
- Ancestor veneration at household shrines
- The Allthing — Annual gathering for law and trade
- Blood-brotherhood — Ritual adoption between clans
- The Long Night — Celebration of winter solstice

### Festivals
| Festival | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| The Allthing | Midsummer | Gathering of clans, law-speaking, trade |
| The Long Night | Winter Solstice | Celebrating survival, ancestor communion |
| First Thaw | Spring | Welcoming the return of warmth |

### Religion
**Dominant Faith:** The Chronicler's Silence (regional Faith variant) in towns; The Old Ways in rural areas

**Other Faiths:**
- The Old Ways — Ancestor veneration, Spirit-Speakers, land spirits
- Orthodox Faith present but not dominant
- Many practice both, seeing no contradiction

**Sacred Sites:**
- [[Myrkvid]] — The Dark Wood, heart of the Old Ways
- The Standing Stones — Ancient ritual circle
- Stoneholm Lake — Where Spirit-Speakers gather
- Ancestor Caves — Where the Old Ways dead are laid to rest

### Art & Architecture
Regional styles:
- Wooden longhouses with carved animal motifs
- Intricate knotwork in metalwork and textiles
- Oral poetry tradition (skaldic verse)
- Rune-carving for commemoration and magic

## History

### Origins
The Northfolk are the oldest people in Eldermyr, predating the southern kingdoms. When the realm unified, the North was never truly conquered—it was persuaded, bribed, and eventually absorbed through marriage and trade. The Old Ways that the Faith suppressed elsewhere survived here, protected by distance and stubbornness.

### Key Events
| Era | Event | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Ancient | First settlement by the Northfolk | The Old Ways established |
| 500 years ago | Unification under the Crown | Nominal allegiance, practical independence |
| 300 years ago | The Faith spreads north | Towns convert; forests remain Old Ways |
| 23 years ago | The Great War | North stayed neutral, profited from both sides |
| Present | Succession Crisis | The clans debate whether to care at all |

### Former Rulers
Previous powers that controlled this region:
- No unified rule; clans have always governed themselves
- The crown claims sovereignty but rarely enforces it

### Recent History
The Northlands sat out the Great War, supplying both sides with timber and furs while losing no blood. This pragmatic neutrality has left them in a strong position—everyone owes them, and no one can afford their enmity. Now, as the succession crisis unfolds, various factions court the northern clans. But why should the North care who sits a distant throne? Some chiefs see opportunity; others want to be left alone. The Allthing will decide.

## Dangers

### Creatures
Dangerous fauna and monsters:
- Wolves, massive and cunning in winter
- Bears, especially when hungry after hibernation
- Dire wolves (larger, magical, rare but deadly)
- Things in Myrkvid that have no names

### Environmental Hazards
- Winter cold that kills in hours
- Summer wildfires
- Avalanches in the foothills
- Getting lost in endless forest

### Hostile Forces
Bandits, enemies, dark powers:
- Outlaw bands (those exiled for crimes)
- Wildlings from the deep woods (not hostile, but dangerous if crossed)
- Something that hunts in Myrkvid during new moons
- Crown tax collectors (viewed as bandits by some)

### Forbidden Areas
Places people avoid:
- The heart of Myrkvid (even Spirit-Speakers go carefully)
- Frozen Hold (the cold there is unnatural)
- Beyond the Greycrown Gap (few return)
- The Drowning Pool (cursed)

## Notable Locations

### Landmarks
Famous natural or constructed features:
- [[Myrkvid]] — The Dark Wood, ancient beyond reckoning

- The Witch-Queen — Spirit-Speaker who turned back an ancient invasion
- The Last Wolf — Dire wolf who defended a village from darkness

## Secrets

1. **The Old Ways are growing stronger.** As the Faith weakens elsewhere, the northern spirits grow more active. Something is waking in Myrkvid that the Spirit-Speakers cannot control.

2. **There is a kingdom beyond the Greycrowns.** Not foreign humans—something else. The smugglers who use the Gap have made bargains they don't fully understand.

3. **Elder Yrsa knows what lies beneath the Ashen Fields.** The ancestor spirits have told her. She has not shared this knowledge because she believes the south must suffer for abandoning the Old Ways.

4. **The crown's grip on the North is weaker than anyone admits.** If the succession crisis leads to war, the clans will declare independence—and no southern army can take them.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Allthing:** The annual gathering approaches, and a southern faction wants the party to influence the vote. But the clans don't appreciate foreign meddling.

2. **The Silent Spirit-Speaker:** A renowned Spirit-Speaker has stopped speaking entirely after a vision in Myrkvid. What did she see?

3. **Beyond the Gap:** Something is coming through the Greycrown Gap—not armies, but refugees. From what are they fleeing?

4. **The Frozen Hold:** A merchant offers a fortune to anyone who can retrieve something from the ice-locked castle. He won't say what.
