# The Ostmark Range

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Ostmark Range forms Eldermyr's eastern border—a wall of mountains fortified by [[House Thorne]] for five centuries. Unlike the ancient [[The Greycrowns|Greycrowns]], these are martial mountains, bristling with watchtowers and controlled by professional soldiers. Use Germanic/Anglo-Saxon naming conventions. The tone should be military, imposing, and disciplined.

## Overview
The Ostmark Range rises along Eldermyr's eastern frontier, a formidable barrier of granite peaks that has protected the realm from foreign invasion for five centuries. [[House Thorne]] has held these mountains since unification, building their power on the simple premise that whoever controls the passes controls the border. Unlike the wild [[The Greycrowns|Greycrowns]] to the north, the Ostmark is a militarized landscape—every peak has a watchtower, every valley a garrison, every route a checkpoint. Only [[Ostmark Pass]] provides reliable passage through these mountains, and [[House Thorne]] has never lost control of it. The Ostmark is not just a mountain range; it is a fortress wall in stone.

## Classification

### Type
**Mountain Type:** Fold Mountains (relatively young, sharp peaks)

### Age
**Geological Age:** Mature — Younger than [[The Greycrowns]], still rugged and imposing

### Scale
**Length:** ~200 miles from north to south
**Width:** 30-50 miles
**Highest Elevation:** 11,800 feet (Eisenzahn / Iron Tooth)
**Average Elevation:** 7,000-9,000 feet for major peaks

## Physical Features

### Major Peaks
| Peak | Elevation | Notable For |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Eisenzahn (Iron Tooth) | 11,800 ft | Highest peak; iron ore deposits; Thorne symbol |
| Wachberg (Watch Mountain) | 10,500 ft | Massive signal tower; visible across the March |
| Stahlhorn (Steel Horn) | 10,200 ft | Above [[Stahlburg]]; forges at its base |
| Die Zwillinge (The Twins) | 9,800 ft | Twin peaks flanking [[Ostmark Pass]] |
| Grenzstein (Border Stone) | 9,400 ft | Marks southern boundary; ancient marker |

### Highest Peak
**Name:** Eisenzahn (Iron Tooth)
**Elevation:** 11,800 feet
**Description:** A jagged, iron-rich peak that gives the mountain its name—the rock itself has a reddish-black hue from ore deposits. The summit is crowned with a signal tower, the highest in Eldermyr, visible from [[Stahlburg]] on clear days. Climbing it is a rite of passage for Thorne officers.
**First Ascent:** Unknown; Thornes have been climbing it for centuries as tradition

### Passes
| Pass | Elevation | Connects | Difficulty |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| [[Ostmark Pass]] | 5,200 ft | Eldermyr ↔ Foreign lands | Moderate (heavily fortified) |
| Smuggler's Way | 7,500 ft | Secret route | Extreme (death trap if caught) |
| The Old Road | 6,800 ft | Ancient route; collapsed | Impassable |
| Eagle's Path | 8,200 ft | Emergency military route | Difficult (trained soldiers only) |

### Valleys
Notable valleys within the range:
- **Stahltal (Steel Valley)** — Where [[Stahlburg]] sits; industrial heartland
- **Grenztal (Border Valley)** — Eastern side; no-man's-land between realms
- **Wachtal (Watch Valley)** — Garrison valley; barracks and supply depots

### Glaciers
- **The Iron Glacier** — Small glacier on Eisenzahn; feeds [[The Stahlfluss]]
- **The Twins' Ice** — Permanent snow between the Twin peaks
- Limited glaciation compared to [[The Greycrowns]]

### Caves & Caverns
- **The Iron Mines** — Extensive mine complex throughout the range
- **Wächter Höhle (Watcher's Cave)** — Natural fortress; emergency garrison
- **The Old Tunnels** — Pre-Thorne excavations; purpose unclear; some sealed

## Geology

### Formation
The Ostmark Range formed roughly 50 million years ago when continental collision pushed up these peaks. The mountains are younger and sharper than [[The Greycrowns]], with exposed cliff faces and dramatic ridgelines. The range is exceptionally rich in iron ore—the foundation of Thorne military power.

### Rock Types
- Granite (dominant)
- Iron-bearing magnetite (abundant)
- Slate (some areas)
- Quartz veins (minor)

### Volcanic Activity
**Status:** None (no volcanic history)

### Earthquakes
Seismic activity: Occasional minor tremors; the mines sometimes cause localized shaking. Nothing major in recorded history.

### Minerals & Ores
| Resource | Location | Mined? |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Iron ore | Throughout | Yes — primary resource; Thorne wealth |
| Coal | Southern range | Yes — fuels forges |
| Silver | Scattered veins | Limited mining |
| Gems | Rare | Occasional finds |

## Climate & Weather

### Climate Zones
How climate changes with elevation:
- **Base (~3,000 ft):** Cool continental; harsh winters, mild summers
- **Mid-elevation (~5,000-7,000 ft):** Alpine; snow 6+ months
- **High elevation (~7,000-10,000 ft):** Permanent snow on north faces
- **Peaks (above 10,000 ft):** Arctic conditions

### Weather Patterns
**Prevailing Winds:** Eastern winds bring harsh weather from foreign lands

**Precipitation:** Heavy snow in winter; summer storms

**Storms:** Less severe than [[The Greycrowns]]; more predictable

### Seasonal Changes
- **Winter (6 months):** [[Ostmark Pass]] difficult but usable; constant maintenance
- **Spring (2 months):** Thaw; avalanche season; pass clearing
- **Summer (3 months):** Best travel; garrison rotation
- **Autumn (1 month):** Preparation for winter; last supply convoys

### Dangers
Weather-related hazards:
- Avalanches (spring primary)
- Blizzards (winter)
- Rockfall (year-round in mining areas)
- Wind exposure on ridges

## Ecology

### Vegetation Zones
| Zone | Elevation | Flora |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Foothills | Below 4,000 ft | [[The Thornwood]] pines, farms |
| Montane | 4,000-6,000 ft | Pine, spruce, mountain meadows |
| Subalpine | 6,000-8,000 ft | Stunted trees, hardy shrubs |
| Alpine | Above 8,000 ft | Grasses, lichens, bare rock |

### Wildlife
**Common:**
- Mountain goats (herded for milk and meat)
- Marmots, pikas
- Eagles, hawks
- Deer in lower elevations

**Rare:**
- [[Iron Peak Wyvern]]s (dangerous; nest in high peaks)
- Mountain lions (occasional)

**Dangerous:**
- [[Iron Peak Wyvern]]s (territorial; attack unprovoked)
- Bears (lower elevations)
- Wolves (pack hunting in winter)

### Unique Species
Creatures found only here:
- **Iron Mountain Goats** — Larger than normal; their horns are valued
- **Steel Eagles** — Large raptors; Thorne soldiers train some for messages
- **Rust Beetles** — Insects that eat iron ore; pest in mines

## Inhabitants

### Mountain Peoples
| People | Location | Lifestyle |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Thorne soldiers | Throughout | Garrison duty |
| Mining families | Mine settlements | Generation miners |
| Support civilians | Stahltal | Smiths, merchants, families |

### Settlements
| Settlement | Type | Population |
|------------|------|------------|
| [[Stahlburg]] | Fortress-city | ~45,000 |
| Eisenstadt | Mining town | ~3,000 |
| Pass Garrison | Military fortress | ~2,000 |
| Watch posts | Military stations | 50-200 each |

### Fortifications
Castles, fortresses, watchtowers:
- **[[Stahlburg]]** — The Iron City; [[House Thorne]]'s seat; carved into the mountain
- **Pass Fortress** — Controls [[Ostmark Pass]]; impregnable
- **The Watch Line** — 47 signal towers along the crest; communication network
- **Eisenzahn Tower** — Summit signal station; crown of the system

### Hermits & Recluses
Those who dwell in isolation:
- Military hermits (forward scouts living alone)
- Retired soldiers in remote valleys
- The odd prospector seeking new ore veins

### Monsters & Creatures
Dangerous inhabitants:
- [[Iron Peak Wyvern]]s (3-4 mated pairs; territorial; major threat)
- Nothing else significant—[[House Thorne]] has eliminated threats systematically

## Strategic Importance

### As a Barrier
The Ostmark Range is Eldermyr's shield against eastern threats. For five centuries, no foreign army has crossed these mountains in force. The single usable pass is so heavily fortified that any invasion would bleed itself dry before reaching the foothills. This natural fortress has allowed Eldermyr to focus internal resources on internal matters—a fact that explains much about the realm's political history.

### Passes & Control
[[House Thorne]] controls every route through the mountains with absolute authority:
- **[[Ostmark Pass]]** — The only viable route; fortress at both ends
- **Smuggler's Way** — Known to Thorne; tolerated in peacetime, closed in war
- **Eagle's Path** — Military-only; requires climbing; emergency evacuation route

### Military Significance
Fortifications and defensive value:
- **The Watch Line** — 47 towers creating continuous surveillance of the border
- **Pass Fortress** — Can hold indefinitely against any force
- **[[Stahlburg]]** — Secondary defensive position; city as citadel
- **The entire range** — Impossible to cross except where Thorne permits

### Historical Battles
Conflicts fought in these mountains:
- **The Holding (300 years ago)** — [[House Thorne]] repelled a foreign invasion; earned their position
- **Border skirmishes (ongoing)** — Regular small conflicts with eastern peoples
- **[[The Great War]]** — The eastern border held; Thorne's primary contribution

## Resources

### Mining
| Mine | Resource | Operator | Output |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Eisenzahn Complex | High-grade iron | [[House Thorne]] / [[The Forgemasters Guild]] | Massive |
| Southern Coal Seams | Coal | [[House Thorne]] | Significant |
| Scattered silver mines | Silver | Licensed operators | Modest |

### Timber
- Lower slopes provide construction timber
- [[The Thornwood]] supplies most wood needs
- Mining consumes significant timber (pit props)

### Hunting & Trapping
- Mountain goats (managed herds)
- Fur-bearing animals (limited)
- No recreational hunting—this is military territory

### Magical Resources
- None exploited
- [[Iron Peak Wyvern]] parts are valuable (dangerous to acquire)
- The iron may have unusual properties; [[The Forgemasters Guild]] investigates

## Travel

### Routes
| Route | Difficulty | Season | Time |
|-------|------------|--------|------|
| [[Ostmark Pass]] | Moderate | Year-round (maintained) | 2-3 days |
| Eagle's Path | Difficult | Summer only | 3-4 days |
| Smuggler's Way | Extreme | Summer only | 4-5 days |

### Hazards
Travel dangers:
- [[Iron Peak Wyvern]] attacks (high elevations)
- Military checkpoints (papers required)
- Avalanches (spring)
- Getting lost means freezing

### Guides & Services
Who helps travelers cross?
- **Thorne military escorts** — Required for authorized travelers

- **Summit Shrine** — Atop Eisenzahn; soldiers pray before climbing

### Ruins
Ancient structures:
- **The Old Tunnels** — Pre-Thorne excavations; purpose unknown
- **The Old Road** — Ancient pass route; collapsed centuries ago
- **Border markers** — Some predate unification; who placed them?

### Mysterious Places
Unexplored or magical locations:
- **The Old Tunnels' depths** — Miners have found strange things; sealed sections
- **Wyvern lairs** — High peaks; no one explores voluntarily
- **Grenztal ruins** — Something on the eastern slopes; in no-man's-land

### Adventure Sites
Dungeons, lairs, treasure locations:
- **[[Iron Peak Wyvern]] nests** — Dangerous but wyvern parts are valuable
- **The Old Tunnels** — What did the ancient miners dig toward?
- **Smuggler caches** — Hidden supplies along illegal routes
- **The collapsed Old Road** — What caused it to fall?

## History

### Geological History
The Ostmark Range is relatively young, formed by the same continental collision that created the eastern portion of [[The Greycrowns]]. The iron-rich rock that defines the range came from ancient seabeds, compressed and metamorphosed over millions of years.

### Early History
First inhabitants and explorers:
- Pre-human: Something mined here before humans came (The Old Tunnels)
- Early peoples avoided the range; too harsh
- [[House Thorne]]'s ancestors settled the foothills before unification

### Major Events
| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Discovery of iron | ~600 years ago | Foundation of Thorne power |
| Unification | ~500 years ago | Thornes granted the March |
| The Holding | ~300 years ago | Repelled invasion; cemented Thorne reputation |
| The Watch Line completed | ~200 years ago | Modern surveillance network |
| [[The Great War]] | 23 years ago | Border held; Thorne reputation maintained |

### Legends
Stories told about these mountains:
- **The Iron Heart** — A legendary ore vein that produces magical metal
- **The Old Miners** — Whoever dug The Old Tunnels; definitely not human
- **The Wyvern Queen** — Said to be an ancient, intelligent wyvern; mother of all others
- **The Pass That Wasn't** — A route that appears and disappears; traps invaders

## Cultural Significance

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- **The Warden's Hand:** This region emphasizes the Warden aspect of [[The Faith of the Three]]—order, duty, watchfulness
- **Iron as sacred:** Thorne tradition treats iron as holy; the mountain's gift
- **Soldier's faith:** Practical, martial religion focused on protection and sacrifice

### In Folklore
Stories and superstitions:
- Never disrespect iron (bad luck)
- The mountains watch (surveillance justified as divine will)
- Eastern winds bring foreign evil (xenophobia formalized)
- The signal fires never go out (Thorne promise)

### Names & Etymology
What do the names mean?
- **Ostmark** — "Eastern March" (border territory)
- **Eisenzahn** — "Iron Tooth" (peak appearance)
- **Stahlburg** — "Steel Fortress" ([[House Thorne]]'s seat)

## Current Situation

### Political Control
Who claims these mountains?
- **[[House Thorne]]:** Absolute control; granted by ancient charter
- **The Crown:** Nominal sovereignty; Thornes answer to the throne
- **Currently:** [[House Thorne]] operates independently during succession crisis

### Conflicts
Current disputes:
- Border incidents with eastern peoples (ongoing)
- Internal tension: [[Lady Margret Thorne]]'s war preparations
- Some question whether Thornes should answer to [[Lord Varic Valdren|Valdren]] regency

### Exploration
Uncharted areas:
- The Old Tunnels' deepest levels
- Several peaks never climbed (why bother?)
- The eastern slopes in Grenztal (too dangerous to survey properly)

## Key Figures

### Mountain Lords
Rulers of mountain territories:
- **[[Lady Margret Thorne]]** — Overall commander; rarely visits personally
- **Marshal Konrad Stahlhelm** — Commander of the Pass Fortress
- **Colonel Gregor Eisenhand** — Head of the Watch Line

### Famous Explorers
Those who mapped or climbed:
- **Aldric Thorne the Bold** — First to climb Eisenzahn (legendary)
- **The Survey Corps** — Mapped the entire range 200 years ago

### Legendary Inhabitants
- **The Wyvern Queen** — If she exists, the greatest threat in the mountains
- **The Old Miners** — Whatever dug The Old Tunnels

## Secrets

1. **The Old Tunnels connect to something deeper.** Miners have broken through into vast caverns that don't match natural formations. [[House Thorne]] has sealed these sections, but strange sounds echo up. The tunnels may connect to the same pre-human civilization that built structures in [[The Greycrowns]] and under [[The King's Wood]].

2. **The iron of Eisenzahn has unusual properties.** Weapons forged from ore specifically from the highest deposits resist magic. [[The Forgemasters Guild]] and [[House Thorne]] have kept this secret for centuries. The ancestral Thorne blades are made from this metal.

3. **[[Lady Margret Thorne]] has been fortifying against internal threats, not external ones.** The recent construction isn't aimed at foreign invasion—it's preparing to resist royal forces. If civil war comes, the Ostmark will close to anyone [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] considers an enemy, including the Crown's army.

4. **The Wyvern Queen is real—and intelligent.** She's been negotiating with [[House Thorne]] for centuries. They don't hunt wyverns; they pay tribute. In exchange, the wyverns don't attack military positions and serve as an air patrol. This secret would destroy Thorne honor if revealed.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Deep Tunnels:** Miners break into an ancient chamber and don't return. [[House Thorne]] hires outside investigators—they want answers but can't risk their own soldiers. What the party finds suggests the Old Tunnels were dug from below, not above.

2. **The Wyvern Treaty:** A young wyvern has broken the secret pact and is attacking travelers. [[House Thorne]] can't explain why they're not hunting it. The party is hired to "deal with the wyvern problem"—and discovers the truth about Thorne's arrangement.

3. **The Smuggler's Message:** A dying smuggler delivers a warning: foreign armies are massing. But when the party tries to report this through official channels, [[House Thorne]] doesn't want to hear it. Are they suppressing the information? Why?

4. **The Magic Iron:** [[The Arcane Academy]] has learned the secret of Eisenzahn iron and wants samples. They hire the party to retrieve ore from the highest deposits—through wyvern territory, past Thorne patrols, for an organization the Thornes despise.

5. **The Border Crossing:** Someone important needs to leave Eldermyr secretly—through [[Ostmark Pass]] without Thorne knowledge. The party must navigate the most heavily watched route in the realm without being caught.
