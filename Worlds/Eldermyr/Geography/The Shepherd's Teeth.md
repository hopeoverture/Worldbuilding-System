# The Shepherd's Teeth

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating hills, create rolling terrain that breaks the monotony of flatlands without the severity of mountains. Include the valleys between, the villages that dot the slopes, and the resources hidden within. Hills should feel pastoral or wild, depending on settlement—gentle country or bandit-haunted wilderness.

## Overview
The Shepherd's Teeth are a line of low, rolling hills that mark the informal boundary between the fertile Crown Lands and the mercantile Western Shore. Named for their rounded, tooth-like summits visible when approaching from the west, these pastoral hills have sheltered shepherds and their flocks for time beyond memory. The gentle slopes are dotted with sheep, goatherds, and small farming communities who have long remained neutral in the political struggles of greater lords. In the current succession crisis, this neutrality faces its greatest test as both [[House Valdren]] and loyalist forces seek to control this vital trade corridor.

## History

### Geological History
The Shepherd's Teeth were pushed up during the same ancient upheaval that raised the [[The Ostmark Range|Ostmark Range]], though erosion has worn them to gentle slopes over countless millennia. The limestone bedrock created the caves and springs that define the region.

### Ancient History
- Pre-human peoples raised the Standing Stones; purpose unclear
- Early settlers found the hills already named; origin lost

### Major Events
| Event | Era | Impact |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Standing Stones erected | Pre-human | Sacred site created |
| First shepherds arrive | Unknown | Pastoral culture begins |
| Valdren expansion attempt | 87 years ago | Hill independence affirmed |
| New Faith dominance | 200 years ago | Old Ways driven underground |

### Settlement History
The hills have never been conquered or fully claimed by any lord. Shepherding clans arrived in waves over centuries, intermarrying and developing their own culture that owes allegiance to no noble house. Various lords have claimed the hills on maps, but practical control has always eluded them.

## Cultural Significance

### To Locals
The hill folk view themselves as the true free people of Eldermyr—neither crown nor coin commands them. Their independence is fierce, their hospitality legendary, and their wool the finest in the realm. The annual Shearing Festival at the Shepherd's Seat draws all clans together.

### To Outsiders
Merchants see the hills as an obstacle and opportunity—difficult terrain but excellent wool. Nobles view the hill folk as uncouth peasants who need proper governance. Pilgrims revere Saint Maren's Well. Smugglers appreciate the western caves.

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- The New Faith honors Saint Maren, who reportedly healed a plague among flocks
- The Old Ways maintain secret gatherings at the Standing Stones
- Shepherds have their own folk beliefs about hill spirits

### Legends
Stories about the hills:
- The Sleeping Giant will wake when the true king returns
- Windwhistle predicts disasters through its singing
- The Lamb's Warren holds treasure from before the First Age
- Mother Maren is immortal; has lived at the Stones for centuries

## Current Situation

### Territorial Control
Who claims these hills?
- [[House Valdren]] claims the western slopes as part of their domain
- Crown loyalists claim the eastern hills serve the throne
- Hill clans insist they serve neither and both leave them in peace

### Conflicts
Current disputes:
- Both factions demand wool, food, and "recruits" from hill villages
- The Lamb's Blood bandits have grown bold; some suspect Valdren backing
- Greenhollow Keep debates whether to accept a faction's "protection"
- Young shepherds split between joining the war or maintaining neutrality

### Development
Changes being made:
- Valdren merchants building a fortified wayhouse without permission
- Pilgrim traffic declining due to war dangers
- Some shepherds moving flocks to Hidden Glen to avoid conscription

## Key Figures

### Hill Lords
Those who rule here:
- Elder Garrett of Greenhollow — Informal leader of the clans; aging moderate
- Warden Tomas — Commander of Greenhollow Keep; seeks neutrality
- Master Vintner Aurelio — Wealthy; trades with both sides

### Notable Inhabitants
- Mother Maren — Wise woman; knows the hills' secrets
- Young Shepherd Cole — Rising voice for armed resistance
- "Teeth" Marget — Lamb's Blood leader; ruthless

### Legendary Figures
- Saint Maren — Healer saint; may or may not have existed

- Old Grumbler — The hill giant; more myth than confirmed

## Secrets

1. The Standing Stones are a sealed gateway to the Feywilds; Mother Maren guards it
2. The Lamb's Warren connects to pre-human ruins beneath the hills containing artifacts
3. "Teeth" Marget receives orders from [[Captain Rennard Valdren]] to destabilize the region

## Plot Hooks

1. Elder Garrett asks the party to negotiate safe passage through the hills for refugees fleeing the succession war
2. Sheep are disappearing in the night; Old Grumbler is blamed, but the truth involves the Lamb's Warren
3. A Valdren army approaches; the hill clans must decide whether to fight, flee, or submit

## Notes
The Shepherd's Teeth represent one of the few regions where common folk maintain genuine independence from noble control. This makes them a potential flashpoint in the succession crisis—whichever faction controls the hills controls the main trade route between east and west.
