# The Silvermere

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a lake, create a body of freshwater with its own character and significance. Include its shores, the settlements around it, and any mysteries it holds. Lakes should feel like focal points—centers of communities, sources of life, or places of hidden depths.

## Overview
The Silvermere is the jewel of the Crown Lands—a vast glacial lake whose waters shimmer with an almost metallic sheen that gives it its name. Fed by meltwater from [[The Greycrowns]] and drained by [[The Kingswater]], the lake has been the heart of royal power since the founding of [[Eldoria]]. The ancient capital rises from its southern shore, and whoever controls the Silvermere controls the kingdom's most vital waterway. In the current succession crisis, the lake has become a contested prize, with [[House Valdren]]'s ships prowling its western reaches while loyalist forces cling to the capital's docks.

## History

### Formation

- First human settlers found the lake already named in older tongues

### Settlement History
- Eldoria founded on southern shore over 800 years ago
- Lake declared royal property; fishing rights carefully regulated
- Noble estates established on western shore 400 years ago

### Major Events
| Event | Era | Impact |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Founding of Eldoria | 800+ years ago | Lake becomes center of power |
| Sinking of the Tower | Unknown (pre-human) | Created the Drowned Vale |
| The Battle of Silver Water | 200 years ago | Naval power established |
| Death of King Aldric III | Recent | Succession crisis begins |

## Secrets

1. The Silver Drake is real—a ancient water spirit bound to the lake who can only be commanded by one who holds all three pieces of the shattered Crown of the First King (one piece lies in the Drowned Tower)
2. High Priestess Sera is secretly dying; she delays choosing a side because her successor would immediately pick one faction
3. The lake's silver shimmer is fading in the southern reaches—the Chorna's curse is already seeping through underground waterways

## Plot Hooks

1. Fishermen report the Silver Drake surfacing near the Drowned Tower; both factions want the party to investigate what's disturbed it
2. High Priestess Sera secretly summons the party to Sanctuary Isle—she wants them to find her successor before she dies
3. A Valdren blockade has trapped refugees on the eastern shore; someone must break through or find another route to Eldoria

## Notes
The Silvermere is the geographic and political heart of Eldermyr. Control of the lake means control of trade, food supply, and symbolic legitimacy. The succession crisis will likely be decided by whoever commands these waters.
