# The Stahlfluss

## Overview
The Stahlfluss—the Steel River—is the lifeblood of [[The Eastern March]], a swift, cold river that descends from [[The Ostmark Range]] and flows through the heart of Thorne territory. Its waters power the forges that make [[The Eastern March]] famous, and its course defines the region's geography. Cold, fast, and unforgiving, the Stahlfluss reflects the character of the people who live along its banks.

## Geography

### Source
The Stahlfluss rises in the high peaks of [[The Ostmark Range]], fed by snowmelt and mountain springs. The source waters are ice-cold year-round.

### Course
The river descends rapidly through mountain valleys, gaining strength from tributaries before reaching [[Stahlburg]]. Below the city, it flows more gently through the eastern highlands before eventually joining [[The Kingswater]] far to the west.

### Character
- **Swift:** The current is strong, especially in the upper reaches
- **Cold:** Even in summer, the water remains frigid
- **Clear:** The mountain waters are remarkably pure
- **Reliable:** Flow is consistent, making it ideal for powering waterwheels

## Importance

### The Forges
The Stahlfluss powers the famous forges of [[The Eastern March]]. Waterwheels along its banks drive bellows and hammers, producing the finest weapons and armor in the realm. [[Grimhild the Smith]]'s legendary forge at [[Grimhold]] depends on the river's power.

### Defense
The river forms a natural defensive barrier. Crossing points are limited and easily defended. During [[The Great War]], [[House Thorne]] used the river to great advantage, holding the eastern bank against superior numbers.

### Trade
While not as navigable as [[The Kingswater]], the lower Stahlfluss carries goods downstream—finished metalwork heading to market, raw materials heading upstream to the forges.

## Notable Features

### The Forge Falls
A series of waterfalls near [[Stahlburg]] where the river drops dramatically. The falls power the greatest concentration of forges in the realm.

### The Iron Bridge
The ancient bridge at [[Stahlburg]], built of stone and iron, the only major crossing for miles. Controlling this bridge means controlling access to [[The Eastern March]].

### The Cold Pools
Deep pools below the falls where the water is said to have magical properties. Blades quenched in these waters are supposedly superior, though smiths disagree on whether this is true.
