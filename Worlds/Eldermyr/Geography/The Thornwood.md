# The Thornwood

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Thornwood is [[House Thorne]]'s training ground—a dense, dark pine forest where generations of Thorne soldiers have learned to fight, survive, and kill. Use Germanic/Anglo-Saxon naming conventions. The tone should be martial, harsh, and disciplined—this is not a mystical wood but a practical one, shaped by war.

## Overview
The Thornwood blankets the highlands of [[The Eastern March]], a vast expanse of dark pines that has served [[House Thorne]] for five centuries as training ground, hunting preserve, and natural fortress. Unlike the mystical [[Myrkvid]] of [[The Northlands]], the Thornwood holds no spirits and few secrets—only hard ground, harsh weather, and the ghosts of every young soldier who has died learning the Thorne way of war. Here, in the shadow of [[The Ostmark Range]], recruits are forged into the finest soldiers in Eldermyr. Those who survive the Thornwood can survive anything.

## Classification

### Type
**Forest Type:** Temperate Coniferous (highland pine forest)

### Age
**Forest Age:** Mature — Managed for centuries; old growth in protected areas, harvested stands elsewhere

### Character
**Atmosphere:** Harsh / Disciplined — A working forest, not a wild one; shaped by generations of military use

### Scale
**Size:** Forest (large but not endless)

**Approximate Area:** ~800 square miles; the largest forest in [[The Eastern March]]

## Physical Features

### Boundaries
| Direction | Border | Marker |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| North | Highland meadows | Treeline at ~4,500 feet |
| South | Farmland and villages | The Woodward's Posts (boundary markers) |
| East | [[The Ostmark Range]] foothills | Where pines give way to rock |
| West | Rolling highlands | The Thornroad |

### Terrain Within
**Elevation:** 2,500-5,000 feet; rises toward the mountains
**Ground Cover:** Pine needles, rocky outcrops, scattered clearings; little undergrowth due to shade
**Water Features:**
- Numerous streams feeding [[The Stahlfluss]]
- The Cold Pools — Natural springs used for conditioning
- Small mountain lakes at higher elevations

### Notable Areas
| Area | Character | Notable For |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| The Training Grounds | Cleared areas with obstacles | Where recruits suffer |
| The Deeps | Oldest, darkest part | Final test site; hunting ground |
| The Warden's Stand | Central highlands | [[House Thorne]] hunting lodge |
| The Killing Floor | Natural amphitheater | Where duels are fought |
| Thornwatch Ridge | Eastern edge | Views [[Ostmark Pass]]; defensive position |

### Edges & Borders
The Thornwood's edges are clearly marked by the Woodward's Posts—carved stone pillars bearing the Thorne thorn-and-sword emblem. Beyond these posts, the forest belongs to [[House Thorne]] absolutely. Poachers are dealt with harshly. Trespassers may be conscripted—or worse.

## Flora

### Dominant Trees
| Species | Prevalence | Characteristics |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Highland Pine | 70% | Tall, straight; excellent timber |
| Mountain Spruce | 20% | Dense; provides cover |
| Iron Oak | 10% | Hardwood in lower elevations; weapons training |

### Canopy
**Height:** 60-100 feet for mature pines
**Density:** Dense (little light reaches the forest floor)
**Light Below:** Perpetual twilight; excellent for ambush training

### Understory
Shrubs, smaller trees:
- Little understory due to dense canopy and acidic soil
- Holly in clearings (used for winter survival training)
- Young pines waiting for gaps in the canopy

### Ground Layer
Ferns, fungi, mosses:
- Thick carpet of pine needles (deadens sound; tracking challenge)
- Mushrooms (some edible; recruits must learn which)
- Moss on north sides of trees (navigation training)

### Notable Plants
Rare or useful species:
- **Soldier's Friend** — Herb that stops bleeding; every Thorne soldier learns to recognize it
- **Iron Root** — Gnarled root vegetable; sustains troops in lean times
- **Bitter Bark** — Pine bark that can be eaten in emergencies; tastes terrible

### Dangerous Flora
Harmful plants:
- **Fool's Mushroom** — Looks edible, causes violent illness; training fatalities
- **Thornberries** — Attractive but poisonous; named for the family's founding legend
- **Stinging Nettles** — Abundant in clearings; part of the hardening process

### Magical Plants
None confirmed. The Thornwood is remarkably mundane—[[House Thorne]] prefers it that way. Steel, not sorcery.

## Fauna

### Common Animals
| Animal | Prevalence | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Deer | Common | Primary hunting target |
| Boar | Common | Dangerous; hunting them is a test |
| Wolves | Moderate | Respected; not hunted |
| Bears | Rare | Hibernating; spring emergence dangerous |
| Hawks | Common | Some trained for hunting |

### Predators
- Wolf packs (respected as fellow hunters)
- Bears (avoided; not worth the risk)
- Lynx (rare; pelts valuable)
- Eagles (high elevations; majestic)

### Rare Species
- **Thornwood Elk** — Larger than common elk; a prize hunt
- **White Wolf** — Extremely rare; killing one is considered bad luck
- **Mountain Lion** — Solitary; occasionally takes livestock

### Monsters
Dangerous creatures:
- None established—the Thornwood's dangers are natural
- Occasional reports of "something large" in the Deeps; likely exaggerated
- Wild boar are monster enough for most purposes

### Magical Creatures
The Thornwood is notably devoid of magical creatures. [[House Thorne]] has maintained this—whether through deliberate extermination or the forest's natural character is debated. Some say the constant military activity drives magical beings away.

## Climate & Seasons

### Climate
**Temperature Range:** Cold highland climate; -10°F in winter to 65°F in summer
**Precipitation:** Heavy snowfall in winter; rain in other seasons; frequent fog

### Seasonal Changes
**Spring:** Muddy, treacherous; training intensifies; bears emerge
**Summer:** Brief respite; main hunting season; relative warmth
**Autumn:** Preparation for winter; final harvests; culling hunts
**Winter:** Brutal; survival training; those who can't adapt die

### Weather Patterns
Forest-specific weather:
- Fog rolling in from the mountains (visibility training)
- Sudden storms developing without warning
- Snow that buries camps overnight
- Wind howling through the pines (masks movement)

## Inhabitants

### Sentient Dwellers
| People | Population | Settlements |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Thorne soldiers (rotating) | 500-2,000 | Training camps |
| Woodwards (forest keepers) | ~100 | Scattered lodges |
| Charcoal burners | ~50 | Seasonal camps |

### Forest Communities
Villages, camps, enclaves:
- **The Warden's Stand** — Permanent hunting lodge; [[House Thorne]] retreat
- **Camp Ironwood** — Primary training facility; barracks for 500
- **The Upper Posts** — Mountain patrol stations
- **Charcoal camps** — Seasonal; produce fuel for [[Stahlburg]]'s forges

### Hermits & Recluses
Isolated inhabitants:
- Retired sergeants who couldn't leave the forest
- Deserters hiding from Thorne justice (rarely survive long)
- An old woodward who claims to remember five generations of Thornes

### Hostile Groups
Bandits, monsters, cults:
- **Deserters** — Occasionally form bands; hunted ruthlessly
- **Poachers** — From neighboring lands; treated as enemy combatants
- **None else** — [[House Thorne]] tolerates no unauthorized presence

## Resources

### Timber
**Quality:** Excellent; Thornwood pine is valued throughout Eldermyr
**Harvesting:** Controlled by [[House Thorne]]; sustainable rotation; profits fund the military

### Hunting & Trapping
Game available:
- Deer (staple; venison feeds Thorne troops)
- Boar (dangerous; hunting is a rite of passage)
- Fur-bearing animals (trade goods; fund operations)
- Elk (prestige hunts for nobility)

### Foraging
| Resource | Season | Locations |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Mushrooms | Autumn | Throughout (requires expertise) |
| Berries | Summer | Clearings, edges |
| Soldier's Friend | Year-round | Shaded areas |
| Pine nuts | Autumn | Everywhere |

### Magical Resources
None harvested. [[House Thorne]] has no interest in magical materials—they trust steel and discipline.

### Restrictions
Who may harvest what?
- **All resources:** [[House Thorne]] exclusively
- **Hunting rights:** Granted to Thorne soldiers and allies only
- **Timber:** Licensed cutters only; strict quotas
- **Poaching:** Punishable by conscription or death

- **The Whispering Pines** — Area where the wind sounds like voices
- **The Cold Spring** — Water that stays ice-cold even in summer

## History

### Origin
The Thornwood has existed since before humans settled [[The Eastern March]]. When the first Thorne lord claimed these highlands 500 years ago, he recognized the forest's value—timber for building, game for feeding troops, and terrain for training soldiers who could fight anywhere. The forest has been Thorne land ever since.

### Ancient History
What happened here long ago?
- Pre-human inhabitants left the Stone Ring and Old Fort
- Early Thornes fought highland clans for control
- The forest was larger; some was cleared for farmland

### Major Events
| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Thorne settlement | ~500 years ago | Forest becomes military reserve |
| The Stone Ring Mystery | Unknown | Ancient site discovered; adopted for ceremonies |
| The Great Cull | 200 years ago | Magical creatures driven out or killed |
| [[The Great War]] training | 27-23 years ago | Forest hosted largest training operation in history |
| The Deserter Hunts | Post-war | Hundreds of traitors killed in the forest |

### Changes Over Time
The forest has shrunk slightly over centuries as farmland expanded, but [[House Thorne]] protects its core fiercely. The training infrastructure has grown—more camps, more paths, more facilities. What was once wild forest is now a military machine.

## Magical Nature

The Thornwood is notably non-magical. Whether this is natural or the result of Thorne policy is debated:
- Some scholars believe the constant military activity suppresses magical energies
- Others suggest the Thornes deliberately exterminated magical creatures
- [[House Thorne]] doesn't care why—they prefer mundane dangers they can fight with steel

### Enchantments
None known.

### Curses
None known.

### Fey Presence
None. The Thornwood is emphatically in the mortal world.

### Magical Effects
Magic works normally but feels... muted. Mages report the forest "resisting" divination and illusion. Whether this is real or psychological is unclear.

## Cultural Significance

### To Locals
[[House Thorne]] defines itself by the Thornwood. Every soldier trains here. Every lord hunts here. Every major decision is made at the Warden's Stand. The forest is not sacred in a religious sense, but it is sacred to Thorne identity. To be "of the Thornwood" means to be tested, hardened, proven.

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- **[[The Faith of the Three]]:** The forest is dedicated to the Warden—god of order, justice, and rule
- **The Warden's Hand:** [[The Eastern March|Eastern March]] tradition emphasizes the Warden over other aspects
- **Practical faith:** Thornes pray before battle, not to trees

### In Folklore
Stories and legends:
- **The First Thorne** — Killed a great beast here; planted the First Tree over its corpse
- **The Deserter's Fate** — Those who flee into the forest are hunted; none survive
- **The Test of the Deeps** — Soldiers who survive alone in the Deeps earn respect
- **The White Wolf** — Appears before great victories; killing one brings defeat

### Names
What is the forest called and why?
- **The Thornwood** — Named for [[House Thorne]]; the family owns it absolutely
- **Dornwald** — Local Germanic dialect; same meaning
- **The Training Grounds** — Common soldier's term

## Current Situation

### Territorial Control
Who claims the forest?
- **[[House Thorne]]:** Absolute ownership; no Crown interference
- **Administered by:** The Lord Woodward (appointed by [[House Thorne]])
- **Patrolled by:** Thorne soldiers; the forest IS their territory

### Threats
Current dangers:
- Increased desertion attempts as political tension rises
- Rumors of strangers in the Deeps (unconfirmed)
- Training accidents increasing as pace intensifies
- [[Lady Margret Thorne]] is pushing harder than ever; soldiers are breaking

### Conflicts
Disputes over the forest:
- Crown has occasionally requested Thorne timber; always refused
- Neighboring lords want hunting rights; always refused
- Internal debate about whether training has become too harsh

### Conservation
Efforts to protect or exploit:
- [[House Thorne]] maintains sustainable timber practices
- Game populations managed through controlled hunting
- The forest's military value requires its preservation

## Key Figures

### Forest Lords
Those who rule here:
- **Lord Woodward Gregor Tannholz** — Manager of forest operations; veteran soldier
- **Master of Hunts Berthold the Grey** — Leads noble hunting expeditions
- **Sergeant-Major Krieg** — Runs training operations; feared by recruits

### Notable Inhabitants
Famous residents:
- **Old Erich** — Ancient woodward who's outlived three Thorne lords

- **The Thousand** — Legendary company trained here before a decisive battle
- **Sergeant Stern** — Mythical instructor who trained the best soldiers in history

## Secrets

1. **Something lives in the Deeps.** Not magical, but large—a remnant of whatever the first Thorne killed, or a descendant. The family knows. They use it as the ultimate test. Those who return from the Deeps have seen it and survived.

2. **The training kills more than admitted.** Official records show acceptable attrition. Actual deaths are three times higher. [[Lady Margret Thorne]] considers this acceptable—she's building an army for the coming war, not a garrison for peacetime.

3. **[[House Thorne]] is stockpiling weapons in the forest.** Caches hidden throughout the Thornwood contain enough arms for 5,000 soldiers. [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] is preparing for civil war—and plans to strike first if necessary.

4. **Deserters have organized.** A band of twenty former Thorne soldiers hides in the Deeps, led by a captain who refused orders during [[The Great War]]. They know Thorne secrets. They're waiting for the right moment to act.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Test:** A Thorne ally asks the party to undergo the Test of the Deeps as proof of worth. What they find in the deepest forest is not what legends describe—and the Thornes have been lying about it for centuries.

2. **The Deserters' Message:** A dying man delivers a message: former Thorne soldiers in the forest have evidence that [[Lady Margret Thorne]] ordered war crimes during [[The Great War]]. Someone needs to find them before Thorne hunters do.

3. **The Hidden Arsenal:** Intelligence suggests [[House Thorne]] is preparing for war. The party must infiltrate the Thornwood and find proof of the weapon caches—without being caught by patrols or killed by the forest itself.

4. **The Hunt:** [[House Thorne]] invites nobles (including the party's patron) to a grand hunt. Politics play out among the pines. But someone is using the hunt to cover an assassination—and the party must prevent it while surrounded by Thorne soldiers.

5. **Training Accident:** A young noble's child has been conscripted into Thorne training as political leverage. The party must extract them from Camp Ironwood without starting a war—and the child may not want to leave.
