# The Trader's Sea

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Trader's Sea is the source of [[House Valdren]]'s wealth—a warm, relatively calm sea that connects [[The Western Shore]] to foreign nations and makes [[Porto Valdris]] the richest port in Eldermyr. Use Mediterranean/Romance naming conventions. The tone should be prosperous, cosmopolitan, and commercially vital.

## Overview
The Trader's Sea stretches along Eldermyr's western coast, a broad expanse of relatively calm, warm waters that has been the realm's window to the wider world for five centuries. Its currents carry merchant vessels laden with spices, silk, and silver from distant lands to the gleaming ports of [[The Western Shore]], and its fishing grounds feed coastal populations beyond counting. Control of this sea—and especially of [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]], the Golden Strait that guards its entrance—has made [[House Valdren]] the wealthiest family in Eldermyr. While other houses fight with swords and soldiers, [[House Valdren|the Valdrens]] fight with trade ledgers and shipping contracts, knowing that whoever controls the Trader's Sea controls the realm's purse strings.

## Classification

### Type
**Ocean Type:** Sea (enclosed by landmasses on most sides)

### Scale
**Size:** Large Sea

**Approximate Area:** ~80,000 square miles (roughly the size of the Mediterranean's Adriatic Sea)

### Position
**Location:** Western edge of Eldermyr, between [[The Western Shore]] and the foreign continent of Meridia
**Bordering Continents:**
- Eldermyr (eastern shore)
- Meridia (western shore; foreign lands beyond the scope of current campaigns)

## Physical Features

### Extent
**North Boundary:** The rocky coasts below [[The Northlands]]
**South Boundary:** Open water leading to the Great Ocean
**East Boundary:** [[The Western Shore]] of Eldermyr
**West Boundary:** The distant coast of Meridia (foreign lands)

### Depth
**Average Depth:** 400 feet
**Deepest Point:** The Valdren Deep (~3,000 feet; north of the Strait)
**Shallow Areas:**
- [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]] (The Golden Strait) — 60-150 feet; navigable but requires care
- The Serenzia Shallows — Fertile fishing grounds
- Coastal waters around [[Porto Valdris]] — Dredged for shipping

### Seas & Gulfs
| Sea/Gulf | Location | Character |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| The Bay of Valdris | Around [[Porto Valdris]] | Calm, well-charted, heavy traffic |
| Gulf of Serenzia | South of [[Serenzia]] | Warm, excellent fishing |
| The Merchant's Reach | Northern extent | Rougher waters, fewer harbors |
| The Corsair's Cove | Western side (Meridian coast) | Pirate haven; Eldermyr ships avoid |

### Major Features
**Trenches:**
- The Valdren Deep — Mysterious deep zone; ancient legends

**Underwater Mountains:**
- The Sunken Towers — Underwater formation that breaks the surface as rocky islets; navigation hazard and legend site

**Reefs:**
- The Coral Gardens — Near [[Serenzia]]; beautiful, protected, sacred to some
- The Ship-Eaters — Dangerous reef near the Strait; countless wrecks

**Islands:** (major chains)
- The Valdren Isles — Chain of small islands controlling approaches to [[Porto Valdris]]; fortified
- Isola del Sole — Largest island; monastery and lighthouse
- The Merchant Rocks — Scattered islets used as waypoints

### Straits & Channels
| Name | Connects | Width | Importance |
|------|----------|-------|------------|
| [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]] (Golden Strait) | Trader's Sea ↔ Great Ocean | 8 miles | Controls ALL foreign trade; [[House Valdren]] controls both shores |
| The Serenzia Channel | Serenzia ↔ Main sea | 15 miles | Secondary route; used when Strait is congested |

## Waters

### Currents
| Current | Direction | Effect |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| The Valdren Current | Clockwise | Carries ships north along Eldermyr coast, south along Meridian coast; aids trade routes |
| The Deep Flow | Inward | Cold water entering through Strait; affects fishing patterns |
| Seasonal Counter-current | Variable | Summer reversal near coast; skilled captains use this |

### Temperature
**Surface (Summer):** 68-75°F (warm, pleasant sailing)
**Surface (Winter):** 55-62°F (mild compared to northern waters)
**Deep Water:** 45-50°F (stable year-round)

### Salinity
Higher than average; warm climate leads to evaporation; affects fishing patterns

### Water Color/Clarity
Deep blue to turquoise in shallows; famous for clarity near [[Serenzia]]; "Valdren Blue" is a color term

### Tides
**Pattern:** Semi-diurnal (two high, two low per day)
**Range:** 3-6 feet (relatively modest)
**Notable Tidal Areas:** The Strait experiences strong tidal currents; timing passages is critical

## Climate

### Weather Patterns
**Prevailing Winds:** Westerlies in summer (good for sailing to Eldermyr); variable in winter
**Storm Season:** Late autumn to early winter; "The Merchant's Grief"
**Calm Periods:** High summer (sometimes too calm; becalmed ships are common)

### Storms
| Type | Season | Severity |
|------|--------|----------|
| Autumn Gales | 8th-10th month | Severe; dozens of ships lost annually |
| Winter Storms | 11th-1st month | Moderate; predictable; smart captains shelter |
| Summer Squalls | 5th-7th month | Brief but violent; develop quickly |

### Climate Influence
The Trader's Sea moderates [[The Western Shore]]'s climate dramatically. While [[The Northlands]] freeze and [[The Eastern March]] shivers, the coast enjoys mild winters and warm summers. This allows year-round agriculture, longer sailing seasons, and the cultivation of grapes, olives, and citrus that cannot grow elsewhere in Eldermyr.

### Fog & Visibility
- Morning fog common in Bay of Valdris; burns off by midday
- The Strait can be foggy for days; experienced pilots essential
- Winter fog rare but dangerous when it occurs

## Ecology

### Surface Life
| Creature | Abundance | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Seabirds (gulls, terns, pelicans) | Abundant | Follow fishing fleets |
| Sea turtles | Common | Nest on Valdren Isles |
| Dolphins | Common | Considered good luck |
| Flying fish | Common | Seasonal; spectacular |

### Deep Life
- Giant squid (rare; reported by deep-water fishermen)
- Vast schools of deep fish (bait for surface predators)
- "Something large" reported in the Valdren Deep (unconfirmed)

### Fish & Fishing

- Whales (seasonal; migrating through the Strait)

### Dangerous Creatures
- Sharks (several species; generally avoid boats)
- Stingrays (shallows; painful but rarely fatal)
- Portuguese man-o'-war (seasonal; drift in currents)

### Monsters
Sea monsters and leviathans:
- **The Leviathan of the Deep** — Ancient legend of something in the Valdren Deep; offerings thrown overboard when crossing
- **Merrow** — Sea-dwelling creatures said to drown sailors; blamed for ships that vanish in calm weather
- **Storm Serpents** — Said to bring the autumn gales; some claim to have seen them

## History

### Geological History
The Trader's Sea formed millions of years ago when tectonic forces created the basin between the continents. [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]] opened roughly 500,000 years ago when the land bridge connecting Eldermyr to southern lands collapsed, creating the narrow passage that would one day make fortunes.

### Age of Discovery
When was it explored?
- The sea itself has been sailed since before recorded history
- The Meridian crossing was first made ~600 years ago
- Complete charts developed over the last 400 years by Valdren cartographers

### Naval History
Famous battles and voyages:
- **The Battle of the Strait** (300 years ago) — [[House Valdren]] defeated a foreign invasion fleet
- **The Pirate War** (150 years ago) — Valdren fleet crushed the Corsair Brotherhood (temporarily)
- **The Siege of Porto Valdris** (during [[The Great War]]) — [[House Valdren]] held the city and sea despite Karath allies' attempts

### Lost Ships
Legendary wrecks:
- **The Crown of Waves** — Royal treasure ship lost in the Ship-Eaters; cargo never recovered
- **The Meridian Queen** — Foreign vessel lost with a princess aboard; ghost sightings reported
- **The Thousand Ships** — Exaggerated legend of an ancient fleet lost in a great storm

### Major Events
| Event | Era | Impact |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Opening of the Strait crossing | ~600 years ago | Foreign trade begins |
| [[House Valdren]] granted Strait control | ~450 years ago | Foundation of Valdren wealth |
| Battle of the Strait | 300 years ago | Valdren naval supremacy established |
| Pirate War | 150 years ago | Trade routes secured |
| [[The Great War]] naval campaign | 23 years ago | [[House Valdren]] held the sea; crucial to victory |

## Cultural Significance

### To Coastal Peoples
The sea is life. Every coastal family has members who fish, sail, or work the docks. Children learn to swim before they walk. The rhythm of tides governs daily life, the weather determines livelihoods, and sailors' superstitions are taken as seriously as [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith's]] doctrines. To coastal folk, the sea is provider, destroyer, and eternal mystery all at once.

### Sea Gods
Deities of this ocean:
- **[[The Faith of the Three]] interpretation:** The sea is the Shepherd's gift, providing for the people
- **Older traditions:** Coastal folk maintain practices honoring "the Lord of Waters" (possibly pre-Faith)
- **Sailors' practices:** Offerings to the Leviathan, prayers to the Drowned Mother—unofficial but widespread

### Legends
Stories about the deep:
- **The Drowned City** — A great city sank beneath the waves in ancient times; some say it can still be seen on calm days
- **The Leviathan** — Something ancient and vast dwells in the Valdren Deep
- **The Merrow Courts** — Sea-folk live beneath the waves, taking sailors as slaves or lovers
- **The Ghost Fleet** — Lost ships sail on, crewed by the drowned, appearing before storms

### Superstitions
Sailor beliefs:
- Never sail on the last day of autumn (the Merchant's Grief begins)
- Dolphins following your ship mean safe passage
- Throwing a coin overboard when crossing the Valdren Deep appeases the Leviathan
- Whistling on deck summons storms
- A woman's hair braided with seaweed protects against drowning
- Red sky at night, sailor's delight; red sky at morning, sailors take warning

## Mysteries

### Unknown Regions
Uncharted waters:
- The far western Meridian coast remains poorly mapped
- Deep water areas are known only by surface observations
- What lies beyond the Corsair's Cove remains Valdren's blind spot

### Lost Lands
Sunken continents, disappeared islands:
- **The Drowned City** — Persistent legend of an underwater civilization
- **The Vanished Isle** — An island recorded on ancient charts that no longer exists
- **The Sunken Towers' origin** — Who built them before they sank?

### The Deep
What lurks below?
- The Valdren Deep has never been explored
- Giant squid are confirmed; what do they eat?
- The Leviathan legend persists despite lack of proof
- Deep-water fishermen report "something" touching their lines

### Anomalies
Strange phenomena:
- The Calm Spots — Areas where ships become becalmed for days, even in good wind
- The Singing Waters — Near the Coral Gardens, the water makes sounds at certain tides
- The Light Beneath — Bioluminescence, but some claim to see patterns, shapes, signals

## Current Situation

### Political Control
Who claims these waters?
- **[[House Valdren]]:** Dominant; controls the Strait, [[Porto Valdris]], and patrols the entire eastern sea
- **The Crown:** Nominal authority; Royal Fleet is weak compared to Valdren
- **Foreign powers:** Meridian nations contest western waters; occasional conflicts
- **De facto:** Valdren IS the sea power in Eldermyr

### Conflicts
Current naval disputes:
- Rising "license fees" are angering foreign merchants
- Tensions between Valdren and Royal Fleet over jurisdiction
- Pirate activity increasing as political attention focuses on the succession
- [[House Thorne]] has been quietly purchasing ships—why does a land-based house need a fleet?

### Threats
Dangers to shipping:
- Piracy increasing (Corsair Brotherhood emboldened)
- Autumn storm season approaching
- Political instability making trade routes uncertain
- Rumors of something stirring in the Valdren Deep (probably nothing)

### Exploration
Current voyages of discovery:
- Valdren cartographers constantly updating charts
- A foreign expedition recently sought permission to explore the Deep (denied)
- Some captains report new islands appearing and disappearing (dismissed as drink)

## Key Figures

### Admirals
Great naval commanders:
- **Admiral Lucio Valdren** — [[Lord Varic Valdren]]'s nephew; commands the Valdren Fleet
- **Commodore Elena Marevento** — Commander of the [[Marevento]] squadron; respected professional
- **Captain-General Aldric Storm** — Nominal commander of the Royal Fleet; frustrated by lack of resources

### Explorers
Famous voyagers:
- **[[Captain Alonzo the Bold]]** — Legendary Valdren explorer; mapped the Meridian crossing
- **Sister Marina** — Priestess who sailed to convert foreign lands; returned with strange tales
- **The Cartographer Valdris** — Founder of the mapping tradition; his charts are still used

### Pirates
Notorious sea raiders:
- **The Corsair King** — Current leader of the Brotherhood; identity disputed
- **Black Serena** — Female pirate captain; operates near the Bitter Coast
- **"Old Wreck"** — Mysterious figure who controls the Ship-Eaters salvage operation

### Legendary Figures
- **[[Captain Alonzo the Bold]]** — National hero; his voyage opened foreign trade
- **The Drowned Queen** — Ghost of the Meridian Queen's princess; appears before storms
- **The First Admiral** — Valdren ancestor who won the Battle of the Strait

## Secrets

1. **The Sunken Towers were a civilization.** [[House Valdren]] divers have explored them and found chambers, artifacts, writing. The towers predate humanity. [[House Valdren]] keeps this secret—the artifacts are valuable and the knowledge dangerous.

2. **[[House Valdren]] has been in contact with the Meridian powers.** If Eldermyr descends into civil war, [[House Valdren]] has negotiated guarantees of continued trade—and possibly military support. They're hedging their bets on the succession.

3. **Something IS awakening in the Valdren Deep.** The disturbance from [[The Ashen Fields]] is affecting magical energies throughout the realm. The ancient thing in the Deep is stirring. Sailors' tales of strange sightings are increasing. The Leviathan may be more than legend.

4. **[[House Thorne]]'s ship purchases are being made through Meridian intermediaries.** [[Lady Margret Thorne]] is building a fleet in secret. If war comes, she plans to challenge Valdren naval supremacy—or at least threaten [[Porto Valdris]] enough to break the blockade she anticipates.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Sunken Discovery:** A diving expedition finds something in the Sunken Towers—writing that matches symbols seen in the Thornhall Catacombs. The party must investigate the connection while avoiding both Valdren agents and foreign competitors.

2. **The Pirate King:** The Corsair Brotherhood is suddenly better organized and better equipped. Someone is funding them. The party is hired to infiltrate and discover who wants Valdren's sea lanes disrupted.

3. **The Deep Awakens:** Ships are vanishing in the Valdren Deep—not in storms, but on calm nights. Something is taking them. The party must investigate and discover what ancient horror the realm's magical crisis has awakened.

4. **The Ghost Fleet:** Sailors report seeing the legendary Ghost Fleet more frequently than ever before. The drowned are sailing again. Is this connected to [[The Ashen Fields]], or something older?

5. **[[House Thorne]]'s Navy:** [[Lord Varic Valdren]] suspects [[House Thorne|the Thornes]] are building ships and hires the party to find proof. Following the trail leads to Meridian ports, foreign conspiracies, and the realization that everyone is preparing for war.
