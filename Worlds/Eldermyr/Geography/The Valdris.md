# The Valdris

## Overview
The Valdris is the great trade river of Eldermyr, flowing from [[The Crown Lands]] to the sea at [[Porto Valdris]]. Along its banks, merchants have grown wealthy for centuries, and at its mouth, [[House Valdren]] controls access to the interior. The river is called "golden" not for its color but for the wealth it carries—trade goods floating downstream, payment flowing up.

## Geography

### Source
The Valdris rises in the hills east of [[Aldersgate]], fed by smaller streams from the surrounding farmland. The source is unremarkable; the river grows great through the tributaries it gathers.

### Course
The river flows generally southwest, growing broader and slower as it descends. It passes through fertile farmland, supporting villages and towns along its length. At [[Porto Valdris]], it enters the sea through a wide delta.

### Character
- **Broad:** Wide enough for substantial vessels in its lower reaches
- **Slow:** Gentle current, easily navigated
- **Navigable:** River traffic flows in both directions year-round
- **Wealthy:** The banks are lined with prosperous farms and towns

## Importance

### Trade Artery
The Valdris is the easiest way to move goods between the interior and the coast. Barges carry grain, timber, and metal downstream; luxury goods, cloth, and imported items travel upstream. The river sees constant traffic.

### Valdren Control
[[House Valdren]] controls [[Porto Valdris]] at the river's mouth, collecting tolls on all traffic. This control, combined with [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]], gives them effective monopoly over the realm's western trade.

### Strategic Value
Armies have marched along the Valdris throughout history. The river provides water, communication, and supply lines. Controlling the river crossings means controlling movement between [[The Crown Lands]] and [[The Western Shore]].

## Notable Features

### The Wide Waters
The stretch of river below [[Crossford]] where the Valdris broadens significantly. Large sailing vessels can navigate this far upstream.

### The Delta
At [[Porto Valdris]], the river splits into multiple channels through a marshy delta. The city straddles the main channel, controlling access.

### The River Markets
Floating markets operate along the lower Valdris, where traders meet to exchange goods without entering port or paying docking fees. [[House Valdren]] tolerates this as long as they get their cut.
