# The Valdris

## Overview
The Valdris is the great trade river of Eldermyr, flowing from [[The Crown Lands]] to the sea at [[Porto Valdris]]. Along its banks, merchants have grown wealthy for centuries, and at its mouth, [[House Valdren]] controls access to the interior. The river is called "golden" not for its color but for the wealth it carries—trade goods floating downstream, payment flowing up.

## Geography

### Source
The Valdris rises in the hills east of [[Aldersgate]], fed by smaller streams from the surrounding farmland. The source is unremarkable; the river grows great through the tributaries it gathers.

### Course
The river flows generally southwest, growing broader and slower as it descends. It passes through fertile farmland, supporting villages and towns along its length. At [[Porto Valdris]], it enters the sea through a wide delta.

### Character
- **Broad:** Wide enough for substantial vessels in its lower reaches
- **Slow:** Gentle current, easily navigated
- **Navigable:** River traffic flows in both directions year-round
- **Wealthy:** The banks are lined with prosperous farms and towns

## Importance

### Trade Artery
The Valdris is the easiest way to move goods between the interior and the coast. Barges carry grain, timber, and metal downstream; luxury goods, cloth, and imported items travel upstream. The river sees constant traffic.

### Valdren Control
[[House Valdren]] controls [[Porto Valdris]] at the river's mouth, collecting tolls on all traffic. This control, combined with [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]], gives them effective monopoly over the realm's western trade.

### Strategic Value
Armies have marched along the Valdris throughout history. The river provides water, communication, and supply lines. Controlling the river crossings means controlling movement between [[The Crown Lands]] and [[The Western Shore]].

## Notable Features

### The Wide Waters
The stretch of river below [[Crossford]] where the Valdris broadens significantly. Large sailing vessels can navigate this far upstream.

### The Delta
At [[Porto Valdris]], the river splits into multiple channels through a marshy delta. The city straddles the main channel, controlling access.

### The River Markets
Floating markets operate along the lower Valdris, where traders meet to exchange goods without entering port or paying docking fees. [[House Valdren]] tolerates this as long as they get their cut.

### River Vista
**Prompt:**
> The Valdris in its broad lower reaches, the Golden River living up to its name as sunset light turns the slow-moving waters to liquid gold. Wide enough for sailing vessels, the river is busy with commerce: merchant barges laden with grain floating downstream, smaller boats rowing upstream with imported goods. Prosperous farmland lining both banks—wheat fields, orchards, wealthy estates with private docks. A riverside town visible on one bank, its warehouses and markets oriented toward the water. The river's gentle current barely visible, perfect for navigation in either direction. The sense of wealth flowing both ways—the trade artery that funds House Valdren's power.

### The Delta at Porto Valdris
**Prompt:**
> The Valdris delta where the Golden River meets the sea at Porto Valdris. The river splitting into multiple channels through marshy wetlands before reaching the harbor. Porto Valdris straddling the main channel, controlling all traffic—wharves and warehouses lining both banks, bridges connecting the two halves of the city. Merchant vessels anchored in the protected harbor beyond, their masts a forest against the sky. Smaller boats navigating between the channels, toll collectors in longboats approaching incoming traffic. The famous floating markets visible on the outer channels where traders meet to exchange goods without entering port. Mediterranean evening light, wealthy city architecture rising above the water.
