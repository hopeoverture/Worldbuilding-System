# The Warden's March

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating plains, create a vast open landscape that stretches to the horizon. Include the grasslands and their seasonal changes, the peoples who roam or farm them, and the sense of freedom and exposure—nowhere to hide, but room to breathe.

## Overview
The Warden's March is the breadbasket of Eldermyr—endless fields of grain stretching from the foothills of [[The Ostmark Range]] to the edge of [[The Crown Lands]], feeding both the capital and the armies that defend the realm. For generations, [[House Thorne]] has ruled these lands with military precision, transforming wild grassland into the most productive farmland in the kingdom. Every village is a militia, every farmer a potential soldier, and the land itself is organized into a grid of roads and watchtowers. In the succession crisis, the March's grain has become a weapon—whoever controls the harvest controls whether Eldermyr eats or starves.

| Farm tracks | Dirt roads | Local |
| The Millstream Path | River route | Seasonal |

### Navigation
How do travelers find their way?
- Grid system of roads makes navigation simple
- Watchtowers visible from anywhere on the plains
- The Ostmark Range provides eastern orientation
- Milestones mark distances on major roads

### Speed
Travel times across the plains:
- East to west (60 miles): 2-3 days by wagon, 1 day by horse
- North to south (40 miles): 1.5-2 days by wagon
- Well-maintained roads allow rapid movement

### Dangers
| Hazard | Season | Severity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Ankheg emergence | Late spring | High |
| Thunderstorms | Summer | Moderate |
| Risen incursions | Any | Increasing |
| Bandits | Post-harvest | Low (well-patrolled) |

### Shelter
Where do travelers rest?
- Wayhouses every 10-15 miles on major roads
- Villages welcome travelers (custom requires hospitality)
- Military barracks offer lodging for soldiers
- Field barns in remote areas

## Warfare

### Tactical Considerations
The flat terrain favors cavalry and organized infantry formations. Watchtowers provide early warning. The irrigation channels and field boundaries can be used defensively but slow movement. Armies can move quickly on the roads but struggle off-road in planting/harvest seasons.

### Historical Battles
- The Battle of the Three Farms (120 years ago) — House Thorne established dominance
- The Ankheg Summer (80 years ago) — Mass emergence; thousands killed
- The Harvest Rebellion (45 years ago) — Peasant uprising crushed
- Risen Skirmishes (ongoing) — Border incursions from the Karath Reach

### Fortifications
Defensive structures:
- The Warden's Tor — Central command fortress
- Thornholt walls and citadel
- The Watch Line — Chain of forts along Ostmark foothills
- Village stockades (every settlement)
- Signal towers (25+ throughout the March)

### Raiding
Threats from hostile groups:
- Risen incursions from the south (primary threat)
- Mountain bandits occasionally descend (rare)
- During succession crisis: loyalist vs. Thorne skirmishes

## Notable Locations

### Landmarks
Natural markers:
- The Standing Soldier — Rock pillar visible for miles
- The Warden's Tor — Artificial hill with fortress
- The Great Oak of Millford — Ancient tree; meeting place

### Sacred Sites
- The Harvest Shrine — New Faith temple blessing the fields
- The Field of Thorns — Memorial to fallen soldiers
- The Standing Soldier — Old Ways significance; offerings still left

### Ruins
Ancient structures:
- Pre-human foundation stones in some fields
- Old watchtowers from before Thorne rule
- Abandoned village (Ashenvale) — cursed reputation

### Gathering Places
Where people meet:
- Millford market — Largest trading center

- Village commons — Local gatherings

### Adventure Sites
- Ankheg tunnels — Extensive networks beneath the surface
- The Ashenvale ruins — Why was this village abandoned?
- The Standing Soldier caves — Hidden chambers within the rock

## History

### Geological History
The Warden's March was once an inland sea floor. When the waters receded, they left deep, fertile soil ideal for agriculture. The Ostmark Range's erosion contributed additional sediment. Natural grassland covered the region until human cultivation began.

### Ancient History
Who lived here first?
- Pre-human peoples left scattered stone foundations
- Early humans grazed livestock
- Organized farming began 600+ years ago

### Major Events
| Event | Era | Impact |
|-------|-----|--------|
| First cultivation | 600+ years ago | Grassland to farmland |
| Battle of Three Farms | 120 years ago | House Thorne takes control |
| The Ankheg Summer | 80 years ago | Defensive measures implemented |
| The Harvest Rebellion | 45 years ago | Tenant reforms enacted |
| The Ashen Fields battle | Recent | Southern border threatened |

### Changes
How have the plains changed over time?
Originally wild prairie; now the most organized agricultural region in Eldermyr. Thorne engineering transformed the landscape with irrigation, roads, and fortifications. The population has tripled in three centuries.

## Cultural Significance

### To Plains Peoples
March folk are proud of their productivity and martial tradition. "Every farmer a soldier, every field a fortress" is their saying. They view themselves as the backbone of the kingdom—feeding the cities, defending the border, and asking little in return. Hard work and duty define their culture.

### To Outsiders
City folk see the March as essential but boring—an endless flat expanse of fields and villages. Nobles respect House Thorne's military contributions. [[House Valdren]] envies the agricultural wealth. The March is seen as dependable, predictable, and fundamentally important.

### In Religion
Sacred meaning:
- The New Faith emphasizes harvest blessings and proper tithe
- The Old Ways persist at the Standing Soldier and field corners
- Farmers maintain folk traditions about grain spirits

### Legends
Stories about the plains:
- The Standing Soldier was a giant turned to stone
- The ankhegs are punishment for some ancient wrong
- The first Warden made a pact with the earth for fertility
- When the fields fail, the kingdom falls

## Current Situation

### Territorial Control
Who claims these lands?
- [[House Thorne]] holds absolute control through [[Lord Aldric Thorne]]
- The crown (traditionally) claims overlordship, but Thorne acts independently
- The southern border with [[The Karath Reach]] is increasingly contested

### Conflicts
Current disputes:
- [[Risen Soldier]] incursions require constant military attention
- Succession crisis divides loyalties; Thorne plays both sides
- Grain shipments are used as leverage against all factions
- Peasants grumble about increased military levies

### Settlement Pressure
Are the plains being developed?
Fully developed; no expansion possible. Population pressure pushes some toward frontier areas. The irrigation system is at maximum capacity.

### Environmental Changes
- Soil depletion in oldest fields
- Ankheg activity increasing (linked to the curse?)
- Water table changes affecting some wells
- Summers seem hotter than grandparents remember

## Key Figures

### Plains Lords
Those who rule here:
- [[Lord Aldric Thorne]] — Warden of the East; rules from Thornholt
- Lady Mira Thorne — His wife; manages household and trade
- Captain Brennan Thorne — Commands the Watch Line

### Tribal Leaders
(Not applicable — sedentary population)

### Legendary Figures
- The First Warden — Legendary founder of Thorne rule
- Red Mira — Led the Harvest Rebellion; folk hero to peasants
- General Stern — Survived the Ankheg Summer

## Secrets

1. The ankhegs are multiplying because something beneath the Warden's March is disturbing them—pre-human ruins that extend deep underground, now stirring with the same energy that created the Risen
2. Lord Aldric Thorne secretly negotiates with both sides in the succession crisis, planning to support whoever offers him the most autonomy—including possible independence
3. The abandoned village of Ashenvale wasn't destroyed by disease as claimed; the entire population vanished overnight, and Thorne soldiers found evidence of ritual sacrifice

## Plot Hooks

1. An ankheg emergence threatens to destroy the harvest; the party must find and seal the tunnel network before it's too late
2. Lord Thorne hires the party to investigate Ashenvale—previous investigators haven't returned
3. A Risen raiding party has captured villagers; the party must rescue them before they're transformed

## Notes
The Warden's March is the agricultural engine of Eldermyr. Its grain feeds the cities, its horses serve in every army, and its people form the backbone of the kingdom's military reserves. Control of the March means control of the kingdom's food supply—a weapon Lord Thorne wields carefully in the succession crisis.
