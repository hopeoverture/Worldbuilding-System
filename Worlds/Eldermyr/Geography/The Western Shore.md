# The Western Shore

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Western Shore is [[House Valdren]]'s domain—wealthy, cultured, and politically cunning. This region reflects Romance/Mediterranean naming conventions with softer sounds and classical influence.

## Overview
The Western Shore glitters with wealth drawn from the Trader's Sea. Its white-walled port cities, terraced vineyards, and sun-drenched plazas seem to belong to a gentler world than the rest of Eldermyr. [[House Valdren]] has ruled here for generations, building an empire of trade, diplomacy, and strategic marriages that has made them the richest family in the realm. Now, with a Valdren boy as heir apparent and a Valdren lord as regent, the Western Shore's golden age seems assured—if they can hold what they've grasped.

## Demographics

### Population
**Total:** ~450,000
**Density:** Dense (concentrated along the coast and river valleys)

### Peoples
| Group | Percentage | Region |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Coastal Folk | 80% | Throughout |
| [[The Crown Lands]] descent | 10% | Inland areas |
| Foreign traders | 7% | Port cities |
| Northern immigrants | 3% | Rural areas |

### Languages
**Common:** The King's Tongue (with melodic regional accent)
**Regional:** Valdris (Romance-influenced dialect, used in literature and song)

### Social Structure
The Western Shore operates on commerce rather than blood. While noble houses exist, merchant families often rival them in wealth and influence. Social climbing is not only possible but expected—a clever trader can marry into nobility within a generation. This fluidity creates both opportunity and instability, as old families resent new money and everyone schemes for advantage.

## Government & Politics

### Political Status
**Type:** Province (sworn to the crown, effectively independent)

### Ruling Authority
**Ruler:** [[Lord Varic Valdren]]
**Title:** Lord of the Western Shore, Master of the Golden Strait
**Seat of Power:** [[Porto Valdris]] (the Palazzo Valdris)

### Government Structure
[[House Valdren]] rules through wealth rather than force. The region is administered by appointed governors and trade councils that manage the port cities. Merchant guilds have significant power, and tax collection is efficient because everyone profits from trade. Justice favors those who can afford advocates, but even the poor can find recourse if they're clever enough.

### Laws & Justice
Notable legal traditions:
- Contract law is sophisticated and binding
- Debts can be inherited; bankruptcy is shameful
- Piracy is punished by death (bad for trade)
- Trade disputes resolved by merchant courts

### External Relations
| Neighbor | Relationship | Issues |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| [[The Crown Lands]] | Alliance | [[House Valdren]] effectively control the regency |
| [[The Eastern March]] | Hostile | [[House Thorne]] views Valdrens as weak and scheming |
| [[The Northlands]] | Commercial | Trade relations, timber imports |
| [[The Karath Reach]] | Indifferent | [[House Karath]] have nothing [[House Valdren]] want |
| Foreign Nations | Profitable | Trade partners across the Trader's Sea |

## Economy

### Primary Industries
| Industry | Importance | Locations |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Trade | Dominant | [[Porto Valdris]], [[Marevento]] |
| Fishing | Major | Coastal villages |
| Viticulture | Major | Inland hills |
| Shipbuilding | Significant | [[Marevento]] |

- Wine (the finest in the known world)
- Olive oil
- Salt
- Finished luxury goods
- Banking and financial services

- Timber (from [[The Northlands|the Northlands]])
- Exotic goods from foreign lands

- [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]] — The Golden Strait, choke point for all sea trade
- Shepherd's Gate — Land route to [[The Crown Lands|the Crown Lands]]

### Wealth
**Prosperity:** Wealthy (the richest region in Eldermyr)

**Distribution:** The Western Shore displays its wealth openly—marble palaces, gilded ships, fine clothing. This prosperity extends even to common folk, who live better than peasants elsewhere. However, the gap between rich and poor is vast, and debt-slavery exists in all but name for those who fall on hard times.

## Culture

### Regional Identity
The people of the Western Shore see themselves as civilized in ways the rest of Eldermyr is not. They value art, music, scholarship, and the subtle exercise of power over crude displays of force. They dress in bright colors, drink fine wine, and consider themselves the cultural heart of the realm—even if [[Aldersgate|the capital]] lies elsewhere.

### Traditions
- Elaborate festivals for every occasion
- Art patronage as a sign of status
- Arranged marriages as political/commercial alliances
- [[Magic of Eldermyr|The art]] of negotiation taught from childhood

### Festivals
| Festival | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| The Wine Blessing | Autumn | Celebration of the grape harvest |
| The Sea's Bounty | Summer | Festival honoring sailors and fishermen |
| The Merchant's Ball | Spring | Opening of the trade season, grand masked ball |

### Religion
**Dominant Faith:** [[The Faith of the Three]] (The Shepherd's Path variant)

**Other Faiths:**
- Orthodox Faith observed but with local flavor
- Foreign religions tolerated in port districts
- Merchant's superstitions about luck and fortune

**Sacred Sites:**
- The Cathedral of the Open Hands ([[Porto Valdris]])
- The Shrine of Safe Harbor (protecting sailors)

## History

### Origins
The Western Shore was settled by traders long before the realm unified. Its natural harbors made it inevitable that commerce would flourish here. When [[The Crown Lands|the Crown Lands]] unified Eldermyr, the western merchant-lords negotiated favorable terms rather than fight—a pattern [[House Valdren]] has followed ever since.

### Key Events
| Era | Event | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| ~800 years ago | First permanent trading posts | Commercial culture established |
| 500 years ago | Unification under the Crown | Valdren negotiated autonomy for the west |
| 200 years ago | Rise of [[House Valdren]] | Became dominant family through marriage and trade |
| 23 years ago | [[The Great War]] | Valdren funded the rebellion, avoided direct fighting |
| 3 months ago | Death of [[High King Aldric II]] | [[Lord Varic Valdren]] Valdren claims regency for grandson [[Edric Valdren]] |

### Former Rulers
Previous powers that controlled this region:
- The Merchant Princes (pre-Valdren era, a council of trading families)
- [[House Valdren]] (for 200 years, rising through cunning rather than conquest)

### Recent History
[[House Valdren]] played [[The Great War]] masterfully. They funded the rebellion against [[The Mad King]] while keeping their sons out of major battles. When victory came, a Valdren daughter married the new king's son, and twenty-three years later, that marriage produced [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]—the boy who now stands as heir. With [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] dead and [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] as regent, [[House Valdren]] have achieved through patience what [[House Thorne]] could not take by force.

## Secrets

1. **[[House Valdren|The Valdrens]] poisoned [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]].** Not [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] himself—he's too cautious—but someone in the family arranged it. [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] suspects but doesn't want to know.

2. **[[Edric Valdren|Edric]] isn't [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]]'s puppet.** The boy has been corresponding with [[Lady Margret Thorne]], exploring an alliance that would cut his grandfather out of power.

3. **The Sunken Palace contains something [[The Faith of the Three]] wants hidden.** The ruins predate [[The Faith of the Three]]—and contain evidence that gods existed before them.

4. **[[House Valdren]]'s wealth is built on debt.** They owe foreign powers more than they can ever repay. Their only hope is to control the crown and its taxing authority.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Merchant's Gambit:** A wealthy trader offers the party a fortune to sabotage a rival's shipment. But the rival is connected to [[House Valdren]] itself.

2. **The Sunken Secret:** A dying scholar reveals the location of the Sunken Palace's entrance—and claims something inside could change everything.

3. **[[Edric Valdren|The Boy King]]'s Letters:** Lady Thorne wants someone to intercept [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s correspondence. Or perhaps [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] wants someone to protect it.

4. **The Pirate King:** Someone is organizing the coastal pirates into a fleet. They're not after plunder—they want to blockade [[Porto Valdris]].
