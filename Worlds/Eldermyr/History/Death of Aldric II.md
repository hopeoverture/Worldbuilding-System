# Death of Aldric II

## Overview
Three months ago, [[High King Aldric II]] "The Steward" died in his sleep. Officially, his heart gave out after years of declining health. Unofficially, half the realm whispers poison—though no one agrees on who administered it. His death ended twenty-three years of hard-won peace and plunged Eldermyr into the succession crisis that now threatens to tear the realm apart.

## The Night

### The Last Evening
On his final night, [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] dined privately with his daughter-in-law Lady Serana and his grandson [[Edric Valdren]]. He seemed tired but not more than usual. He retired early, complaining of a headache. His servants helped him to bed. He never woke.

### Discovery
At dawn, the king's valet found him still and cold. The court physicians examined the body and found no obvious cause—no wounds, no signs of struggle. His face was peaceful. His heart, they concluded, simply stopped.

### The Announcement
By midday, bells tolled across [[Aldersgate]]. The king was dead. Long live... whom?

## The Immediate Aftermath

### The Regency
[[Lord Varic Valdren]], as grandfather to the heir [[Edric Valdren]], claimed the regency within hours. [[House Thorne]] protested. [[High Confessor Maren]] demanded [[The Faith of the Three]] sanction any succession. [[House Karath]] said nothing—and smiled.

### The Funeral
[[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] was interred in the Royal Crypts beneath [[Aldersgate]] with full honors. Every noble house attended. The funeral was peaceful. The reception afterward was not.

### The Council
A Great Council was called to determine the succession. It accomplished nothing. Three months later, it remains deadlocked, and [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] rules as regent with no end in sight.

## The Suspects

### Natural Causes (Official)
The official position is that [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] died of heart failure. He was 62, had been in declining health for years, and bore the stress of holding a fractured realm together. This explanation satisfies no one.

### [[Lord Varic Valdren]] (Most Suspected)
[[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] had the most to gain—immediate assumption of the regency. He had the means—his wealth could procure any poison. And he had opportunity—his daughter Lady Serana served the king's wine. The whispers are loudest here.

**The Truth:** [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] did poison [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]], using a slow-acting compound administered over months. Lady Serana was his unwitting instrument. No one can prove it.

### [[House Thorne]] (Whispered)
Some suggest [[Lady Margret Thorne]] ordered the assassination to prevent [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s coronation and force a succession crisis that [[House Thorne]] could exploit. Lady Margret denies this—and she is, in fact, innocent of this particular crime.

### [[House Karath]] (Feared)
[[Lord Draven Karath]] wanted the peace to end. [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]'s death serves his purposes perfectly. But if Karath agents murdered the king, they did so without [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s direct order—he was genuinely surprised by the timing.

### [[The Faith of the Three]] (Suspected by Few)
[[High Confessor Maren]] wanted a ruler chosen by divine mandate, not blood. A vacancy creates opportunity for [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] to assert authority. Few believe Maren capable of regicide, but he has not been vocal in denying it.

### [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] Himself (The Hidden Truth)
The king knew he was being poisoned. He had known for months. He chose to drink the wine anyway—he was tired, the poison offered an easier death than waiting for assassins, and he hoped his death might shock the realm into compromise. He was wrong.

## Political Consequences

### The Regency
[[Lord Varic Valdren]] rules in [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s name, delaying the coronation with one excuse after another. The longer he rules, the more enemies he makes.

### [[House Thorne]]'s Anger
[[Lady Margret Thorne]] believes Valdren murdered the king. She prepares for war while seeking proof. Her sons are restless.

### [[House Karath]]'s Opportunity
[[Lord Draven Karath]] sees the chaos as his moment. With the realm divided, who will notice what rises in [[The Ashen Fields]]?

### [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]]'s Position
[[High Confessor Maren]] refuses to crown anyone until the succession is legitimately determined—which conveniently gives him leverage over all claimants.

## The Letters

[[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] left sealed letters for each major faction leader, to be opened after his death. Each contains advice specific to that leader—and warnings about what will happen if they cannot find compromise. As of yet, no one has admitted to opening theirs. What they contain could change everything.

## Legacy

### The End of Peace
[[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]'s death ended the only stability Eldermyr has known since [[The Great War]]. Whatever peace existed was built on one man's diplomacy. Without him, there is nothing.

### The Coming War
Everyone knows war is coming. The only questions are when, between whom, and how many will die.

### The Forgotten Threat
While the houses circle each other, the dead rise in [[The Ashen Fields]]. [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] knew about this threat and suppressed it. Now no one is watching.

### The Discovery
**Prompt:**
> The royal bedchamber at dawn, moments after the discovery of High King Aldric II's death. The elderly king lies still and peaceful in his great bed, the covers barely disturbed, his face showing no pain—as if he simply decided not to wake. Morning light streams through tall windows, catching motes of dust in the air. The king's valet stands frozen at the bedside, hand still reaching toward his master, face a mask of dawning horror. The chamber itself speaks of a careful, ordered life: maps of Eldermyr on the walls, correspondence neatly stacked, the crown that should have passed to his heir sitting on its velvet cushion. A half-empty wine cup sits on the bedside table—the same cup Lady Serana served him the night before. The atmosphere of a realm's fate changing in a single, silent moment.

### The Funeral Procession
**Prompt:**
> The funeral procession for High King Aldric II through the streets of Aldersgate, a solemn parade marking the end of an era. The king's body lies on a draped bier carried by armored guards, the Iron Crown resting on a cushion beside him—unclaimed, its future uncertain. Behind the bier walks Lord Varic Valdren in regent's black, his face a mask of appropriate grief hiding calculating eyes. Lady Margret Thorne follows in mourning armor, barely concealing her fury. The young heir Edric Valdren walks between factions, a boy caught in the middle of a gathering storm. Crowds line the streets in genuine mourning—Aldric was not loved, but he was stability. Priests of the Three walk alongside, chanting the rites of passage. The Great Temple rises in the background where the interment will take place. Banners hang at half-staff. The bells toll. The atmosphere of a kingdom holding its breath, knowing that when the mourning ends, the fighting will begin.
