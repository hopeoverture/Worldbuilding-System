# The Battle of Ashen Fields

## Overview
The Battle of Ashen Fields was the final confrontation of the Great War, where an alliance of houses defeated the Mad King Valdus Karath. It was supposed to be a triumph—the end of tyranny, the liberation of the realm. Instead, it became a curse. Prince Edric the Liberator struck down his father, but died doing so. Ten thousand soldiers died and were improperly buried. The Mad King's crown survived. And something beneath the battlefield began to wake.

## Prelude

### The Cornered King
By the fourth year of the war, Valdus Karath had been pushed back to his heartland. His allies had abandoned him. His undead armies had been depleted. He retreated to the fertile farmland south of Chernogrod—the last defensible position before his capital.

### The Alliance Advance
Lord Edmund Thorne commanded the Alliance forces: 15,000 soldiers from Houses Thorne and Valdren, blessed weapons from the Faith, and Crown Prince Edric at his side. They knew this would be the end—one way or another.

### The Mad King's Preparation
Valdus had spent weeks preparing the battlefield. Mass graves had been dug. Rituals had been performed. He wore the Blackened Crown openly now, no longer hiding his necromancy. He had perhaps 8,000 living soldiers—and thousands more who were no longer living.

## The Battle

### Dawn: The Advance
The Alliance attacked at first light, hoping to limit the power of the undead. Lord Edmund led the center; Prince Edric commanded the left flank; Lord Marcus Valdren's son commanded the right. Holy symbols blazed. War hymns echoed across the fields.

### Morning: The Counter
Valdus revealed his trap. The mass graves opened, and thousands of corpses rose—soldiers who had died in previous battles, prisoners sacrificed for this moment. The Alliance advance stalled as the living found themselves fighting the dead.

### Noon: The Breaking Point
The Alliance center began to give way. Lord Edmund Thorne rallied his forces with Thornbane, cutting through undead and living alike. Prince Edric saw his opportunity—the Mad King had advanced to direct his forces personally, protected only by his guard and his unnatural power.

### Afternoon: The Duel
Prince Edric challenged his father. What happened next is unclear—survivors give conflicting accounts. Valdus unleashed terrible power. Edric's holy blade burned with light. The Blackened Crown flared with dark energy. When the clash ended, both were on the ground. Edric struck the killing blow, then collapsed.

### Evening: The Aftermath
With Valdus dead, his undead collapsed. The remaining royal forces surrendered or fled. But 10,000 soldiers—Alliance and Crown alike—lay dead or dying. There were not enough priests to perform proper rites. The bodies were dumped in mass graves. The sun set on a field of ashes.

## The Cost

### Casualties
| Side | Killed | Wounded | Captured |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| Alliance | 4,000 | 3,000 | - |
| Crown | 6,000+ | Unknown | 2,000 |
| **Total** | **10,000+** | Unknown | 2,000 |

### Notable Deaths
- **Prince Edric the Liberator:** Killed striking down his father
- **The Mad King Valdus Karath:** Killed by his son
- **Lord Marcus Valdren's Son:** Killed in the right flank collapse
- **Dozens of minor nobles** from all houses

### The Unburied
Perhaps 8,000 of the dead were simply dumped in mass graves without proper rites. There were not enough priests. There was not enough time. The survivors wanted to leave this cursed place. They would regret that haste.

## Aftermath

### Immediate
Lord Edmund Thorne was acclaimed as hero of the battle. Lord Aldric (Edmund's cousin, not present at the battle but a leading lord) was chosen as High King, as no Karath heir old enough to rule remained. The war was declared over. The realm celebrated.

### The Young Lord
Lord Draven Karath was a child when his grandfather fell. He was spared execution but stripped of most family lands. He grew up knowing that everything his house once possessed was taken. He grew up hating the houses that took it.

### The Curse Begins
Within months, the farmland around the battlefield began to die. Crops failed. Animals sickened. Villagers reported seeing figures moving in the fields at night. The first undead rose within a year. The curse had begun.

## The Curse

### Origin
The improper burial of 10,000 souls broke the Chronicler's covenant. These spirits could not pass to the Final Walk. They remained, trapped between death and rest. Something ancient beneath the battlefield—the Unnamed—began feeding on them.

### Growth
Each year, the curse spread further. The dead rose in greater numbers. The blight consumed more farmland. By the present day, the Ashen Fields encompass five miles in every direction, and the curse is accelerating.

### The Figure
In the last year, something new has appeared: a figure walking among the dead, wearing a crown of blackened iron. Witnesses believe it is the Mad King, somehow preserved or returned. They may be right.

## Secrets

1. **Edric's Choice.** Prince Edric deliberately killed his father rather than capturing him. His letter, hidden on the battlefield, explains: Valdus was no longer human. The Unnamed was already inside him. Capture would have been worse than death.

2. **The Crown Survived.** The Blackened Crown should have been destroyed. Instead, someone took it from Valdus's body before the burial. Who took it, and where it went for twenty-three years, is unknown.

3. **Edmund Knew.** Lord Edmund Thorne saw what happened between Edric and Valdus. He knew the crown survived. He said nothing. His guilt contributed to his death at another battle—but not before he told Lady Margret.

## Legacy

### Political
The battle established the current order: Thorne and Valdren ascendant, Karath humiliated. But the death of Prince Edric meant no clear heir to the alliance leadership. The seeds of the succession crisis were planted in victory.

### Military
Veterans of the Ashen Fields are respected—and pitied. Many never recovered from what they saw. The tactics developed against the undead are still taught, but few believed they would be needed again.

### Religious
The failure to properly bury the dead haunts the Faith. High Confessor Maren's predecessor died of guilt. The current crisis—dead rising in violation of the Chronicler's covenant—is seen as divine punishment by some.
