# The Great War

## Overview
The Great War was a four-year conflict that consumed Eldermyr, fought between [[The Mad King]] [[The Mad King]] and an alliance of the other great houses. It began when Valdus's tyranny became unbearable and ended at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], where Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] the Liberator struck down his own father. The war killed tens of thousands, devastated [[The Karath Reach]], and left wounds that have never healed. Twenty-three years later, the consequences are still unfolding.

## Causes

### [[The Mad King]]'s Tyranny
[[The Mad King|Valdus Karath]] inherited a prosperous realm and systematically destroyed it. His paranoia led to purges of nobles he suspected of disloyalty. His ambition led to crushing taxes and forced labor. His madness led to something worse: necromantic experiments that violated every law of gods and men.

### The Breaking Point
When Valdus began requiring "tribute" of living prisoners for his rituals—when villages were emptied to feed his experiments—the other houses could no longer remain passive. Lord Edmund Thorne and Lord Marcus Valdren secretly met to plan resistance.

### Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s Choice
Crown Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] Karath faced an impossible choice: remain loyal to his father and share in his crimes, or take up arms against him. He chose rebellion, providing the alliance with legitimacy and insider knowledge.

## Major Factions

### The Alliance
| House | Leader | Contribution |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| [[House Thorne]] | Lord Edmund Thorne | Ground forces, military leadership |
| [[House Valdren]] | Lord Marcus Valdren | Fleet, supplies, gold |
| [[The Faith of the Three]] | High Confessor Brennan | Moral authority, healing |
| [[House Karath]] (rebel) | Prince [[Edric Valdren]] | Legitimacy, intelligence |

### The Crown
| Force | Leader | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| Royal Army | Generals (various) | Conventional forces |
| [[The Mad King]]'s Guard | Fanatical loyalists | Personal protection |
| The Undead Host | Valdus himself | Necromantic abominations |

## Timeline

### Year 1: The Rising
- Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] flees [[Aldersgate|the capital]], declaring against his father
- [[House Thorne]] and [[House Valdren]] announce alliance
- [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] denounces Valdus as a heretic
- Initial battles favor the Alliance

### Year 2: The Stalemate
- Valdus unveils undead soldiers, turning the tide
- The Alliance is pushed back
- Lord Edmund Thorne holds [[The Eastern March|the Eastern March]]
- Atrocities mount on both sides

### Year 3: The Turning
- Alliance discovers how to fight the undead (cold iron, blessed weapons)
- Naval blockade cuts Valdus's supplies
- [[The Karath Reach]] population rises against their king
- Valdus becomes increasingly desperate

### Year 4: The End
- Alliance pushes into [[The Karath Reach|the Karath Reach]]
- Valdus makes a final stand at what would become [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]
- [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] decides everything
- Valdus and Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] both fall

## Key Battles

### The Battle of [[Stahlburg]] Gate (Year 1)
[[House Thorne]]'s first major victory, proving the Alliance could stand against royal forces. Lord Edmund Thorne earned his reputation as a brilliant commander.

### The Siege of [[Porto Valdris]] (Year 2)
Valdus's forces attempted to take the Valdren capital. The naval defense held, and the siege failed after three months. This preserved Alliance resources.

### The Breaking of the Host (Year 3)
The Alliance learned that cold iron and holy symbols could destroy the undead. A series of battles systematically eliminated Valdus's supernatural advantage.

### [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] (Year 4)
The final confrontation. See [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] for full details.

## Aftermath

### Immediate
- Valdus and Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] dead
- The Karath line nearly extinguished ([[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]], a child, survived)
- 10,000 dead at [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]], improperly buried
- Lord Aldric (later [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]) acclaimed as High King

### Long-Term
- [[House Karath]] stripped of most lands and power
- [[House Thorne]] and Valdren elevated
- [[The Karath Reach]] never recovered
- The curse of [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] began

### The Hidden Cost
The 10,000 who died at [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] were not properly laid to rest. The Chronicler's covenant was broken. The trapped souls fed something ancient beneath the battlefield. The war's true cost is only now becoming clear.

## Legacy

### Political
The Great War established the current power structure: Valdren and Thorne ascendant, Karath humiliated. But it also created the current crisis—when [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] died, no clear successor existed because the war had killed so many heirs.

### Cultural
The war is remembered as a triumph of good over evil, but the reality was more complex. Atrocities were committed by both sides. Veterans carry scars, physical and otherwise. The generation that fought is passing; the generation that inherited the consequences resents both the cost and the glory.

### Theological
[[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] gained power by supporting the Alliance, but the theological implications of the curse are troubling. If the Chronicler's covenant can be so easily broken, what does that mean for faith?

## Secrets

1. **The Alliance's Bargain.** To secure [[House Valdren]]'s support, Lord Edmund Thorne promised that a Valdren would one day wear the crown. This secret agreement may be why [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] believes he has the right to the regency.

2. **[[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s Letter.** Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] wrote a letter explaining why he killed his father rather than capturing him. He believed Valdus had become something inhuman—a vessel for [[The Unnamed]]. The letter is hidden at [[The Ashen Fields]].

3. **The Survivors.** Some of Valdus's inner circle escaped the battle. They know secrets about [[The Mad King]]'s rituals—and about [[The Blackened Crown]]. One of them has been in contact with [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]].
