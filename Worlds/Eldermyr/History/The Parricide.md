# The Parricide

## Overview

The Parricide—the killing of King Valdus Karath by his own son, Prince Edric—ended [[The Great War]] and broke the Mad King's reign of terror. At [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], when thirty thousand lay dead and the curse was already spreading, Prince Edric challenged his father to single combat. What happened next has been told a thousand ways, but the truth—as always—is more complicated than the songs suggest.

This event occurred twenty-three years ago and remains the defining moment of modern Eldermyr. Every current crisis traces back to that bloody day on the Ashen Fields.

## Background

### The Mad King's Reign
[[The Mad King|Valdus Karath]] had ruled for seven years of escalating horror. What began as harsh justice became arbitrary cruelty. The purges of "traitors" expanded to include anyone who drew the king's suspicion. The experiments in the palace dungeons produced screams that guards learned to ignore. The king spoke of voices, of powers gathering, of transformations that would make him eternal.

### The Great War
When the noble houses rose in rebellion, the Mad King unleashed horrors. [[House Karath]]'s armies were supplemented by *things*—creatures that should not exist, dead soldiers who continued fighting, rituals that corrupted the land itself. [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]] killed thirty thousand and created a curse that spreads to this day.

### The Battle of Ashen Fields
The final confrontation came not in Aldersgate but on the battlefield. The Mad King himself took the field at the Ashen Fields, surrounded by his darkest creations—risen dead, things that should not exist, soldiers who had already died once. The rebel alliance met him with everything they had.

Thirty thousand would die that day. The land itself would be cursed. But Prince Edric knew this was his only chance.

## The Prince's Burden

### Edric's Position
Prince Edric was the Mad King's eldest son—a young man who had watched his father descend into madness, who had been forced to participate in rituals that haunted his dreams, who carried guilt for every atrocity committed in his family's name.

He had fled the capital three years earlier and declared against his father. He gave the rebellion legitimacy—a royal prince condemning royal tyranny. For three years he fought soldiers who had once been loyal to him, watched friends die, and carried the weight of what he knew he must eventually do.

### The Holy Blessing
Before the battle, [[The Faith of the Three]] blessed Edric's blade with holy light—the only weapon that could strike down what his father had become. Whatever bargain Valdus had made with [[The Unnamed]], whatever transformations had twisted his soul, the Faith believed their blessing could overcome it.

Whether it was enough is still debated.

## The Duel

### The Challenge
In the chaos of the battle, Prince Edric fought his way to his father. Around them, thirty thousand soldiers clashed and died. The dead rose to fight again. The sky churned with unnatural clouds. The ground drank blood.

Edric challenged his father to single combat. Valdus—or the thing wearing Valdus—accepted.

### The Confrontation
What happened next is disputed. Some say Valdus was no longer human—that [[The Unnamed]] spoke through him, offering Edric power if he would only kneel. According to those who stood closest, the Mad King smiled and said something that made Edric weep even as he raised his blade.

Witnesses disagree on the words. Some heard: *"You're too late, boy. I've already won."* Others insist it was: *"I loved you, son. Even now."* Perhaps both are true.

### The Strike
The combat was brief and terrible. Edric's blade burned with holy light. Valdus unleashed darkness that should have killed any mortal. In the end, Prince Edric drove his sword through his father's heart—and wept as he did it.

Valdus fell. The darkness he had summoned collapsed inward. And Edric, wounds too severe to survive, collapsed beside his father's body.

## Aftermath

### The Prince's Fate
Prince Edric died within the hour. His wounds were mortal—no healer could have saved him. Lord Edmund Thorne held him as he passed. According to Thorne, Edric's last words were: *"It's done. Don't let it be for nothing."*

In the chaos that followed the battle, Edric's body was placed in a mass grave with common soldiers. Only Lord Edmund Thorne knew, and he died before he could arrange a proper tomb. The hero of Eldermyr lies in an unmarked grave among the risen dead he helped create.

### The Official Story
The version recorded in histories presents the Parricide as a heroic act. Prince Edric, unable to bear his father's tyranny, sacrificed his honor and his life to save the realm. He is remembered as "The Liberator," and monuments stand in [[Thornhall]] and [[Aldersgate]] in his honor.

This version is true. It is also incomplete.

### What Was Released?
Something changed after the Parricide. Whatever the Mad King had become, whatever bargain he had made with [[The Unnamed]], it did not die with his body. The curse at [[The Ashen Fields]] began spreading faster. The dead that fell in battle refused to stay down. [[The Spirit-Speakers]] say the boundary between living and dead grew thinner.

Edric's letter—written before the battle and hidden somewhere on the Ashen Fields—explains that killing Valdus's body would not kill the entity, only trap it. He hoped that would be enough.

Twenty-three years later, the Figure in the Blackened Crown has appeared in [[The Ashen Fields]], wearing a face that looks very much like Valdus Karath. Was Edric wrong? Or did something break the trap?

## Legacy

### The Iron Crown Question
The Parricide created the succession crisis that now threatens Eldermyr. [[High King Aldric II]], Valdus's younger brother, was a compromise candidate—acceptable because he wasn't Karath by blood, wasn't Thorne or Valdren by ambition. His death without clear heir has reopened questions that the Parricide was supposed to settle.

### The Karath Shame
[[House Karath]] was broken by the Parricide. Their king was a monster; their prince destroyed him. The house lost its lands, its armies, its honor. Twenty-three years later, they nurse resentment in [[Chernogrod]] and [[Lord Draven Karath]] makes bargains that echo his father's madness.

### The Price of Memory
Those who knew the truth of the Parricide are dying or dead. [[High King Aldric II]] never spoke of what his nephew told him. The guards who were there have passed away. Soon, only the official story will remain—and with it, the ability to understand what was actually unleashed.

## Secrets

1. **The True Ritual:** The Mad King completed his ritual before the battle began. What died on the field was already partly transformed. Edric didn't stop anything—he triggered the ritual's final phase. Whatever Valdus became, it didn't need a body anymore. The curse that spreads from the Ashen Fields is the proof.

2. **The Refused Bargain:** During the final duel, [[The Unnamed]] offered Edric everything—the crown, immortality, his father restored to sanity. Edric refused. The entity's rage at his refusal may be why the curse persists, why his body will not rest, why the Figure in the Blackened Crown seems to be searching for something.

3. **The Unquiet Grave:** Prince Edric's spirit is among the risen dead of the Ashen Fields. Unlike the others, he does not attack the living—he wanders the cursed ground, still blessed by the Faith's holy light. Some nights, soldiers on the border claim to see a figure glowing gold among the shambling dead, as if still searching for something.

4. **The Letter's Location:** Edric's letter explaining everything—what his father became, what was released, how to truly end it—is buried somewhere in the Ashen Fields. The Figure in the Blackened Crown is searching for it. If the Figure finds and destroys that letter, the knowledge of how to defeat [[The Unnamed]] may be lost forever.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Survivor:** Someone claims to have witnessed the final duel and wants to tell the true story before they die. Are they genuine, or is this a Karath plot to rewrite history? What did they really hear the Mad King say?

2. **The Letter Hunt:** Both [[The Grey Wardens]] and [[House Karath]] are searching for Edric's letter, buried somewhere in the Ashen Fields. The Wardens want to learn how to end the curse. Lord Draven Karath wants to destroy any evidence of what his grandfather truly became.

3. **The Golden Ghost:** Soldiers report a figure wreathed in golden light wandering the Ashen Fields at night. Is it Prince Edric's spirit? Can he communicate? Does he know where the letter is hidden? And what does the Figure in the Blackened Crown do when they encounter each other?

4. **The Hero's Rest:** Lord Edmund Thorne's deathbed confession revealed that Edric lies in a mass grave, not a hero's tomb. Someone wants to recover his body for proper burial—but removing anything from the Ashen Fields risks spreading the curse, and Edric's remains are blessed. What happens if you remove the one holy thing from cursed ground?
