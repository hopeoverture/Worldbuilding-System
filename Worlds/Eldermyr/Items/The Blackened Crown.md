# The Blackened Crown

## Overview
The Blackened Crown is what remains of [[The Mad King]]'s ambition—a mockery of [[The Iron Crown]], forged in blood and fire during [[The Mad King]]'s reign of terror. Where [[The Iron Crown]] binds ruler to realm, the Blackened Crown binds the dead to their master. It was believed destroyed when Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] slew [[The Mad King]] at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], but survivors speak of a figure rising from the mass graves wearing a crown of blackened iron. [[Lord Draven Karath]] has seen this figure in his dreams. He believes it is his grandfather, waiting to reclaim what was taken. He may be right—and that is the worst possible outcome.

## Classification

### Type
**Artifact Type:** Regalia (Corrupted)

**Artifact Class:** Major Artifact

### Alignment
**Item Alignment:** Chaotic Evil (the Crown serves only destruction and domination)

### Power Level
**Relative Power:** Legendary (potentially World-Shaping if fully awakened)

### Sentience
**Sentient:** Yes—the Crown contains fragments of every soul it has consumed, dominated by [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s will

## Appearance

### Physical Description
The Blackened Crown was once an attempt to replicate [[The Iron Crown|the Iron Crown]]'s form—a circlet of iron with silver bands. But the iron has been corrupted to a charred black, as if burned from within. The silver bands have tarnished to the color of old blood, and the engravings have twisted into a language no mortal should read. The Crown is cold to the touch, even in fire, and leaves black marks on skin. Those who look at it too long see faces screaming in the metal.

### Size & Weight
**Dimensions:** Similar to [[The Iron Crown|the Iron Crown]] (7 inches diameter, 2 inches tall)

**Weight:** Weightless to the willing, impossibly heavy to the resistant

**Unusual Properties:** The Crown phases through most materials; it cannot be contained by normal means

### Materials
**Primary Material:** Cold iron, corrupted by necromantic ritual

**Secondary Materials:** Silver bands stained with sacrificial blood

**Unknown Materials:** Contains the souls of the 10,000 who died at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]], bound by [[The Mad King]]'s dying curse

### Magical Manifestation
- Shadows gather around the wearer
- The dead within a mile grow restless
- Temperature drops; breath becomes visible
- Whispers of the bound souls become audible

### Recognition Features
- The charred, burnt appearance
- The screaming faces visible in the metal
- The unnatural cold
- The way it seems to move when not directly observed

| Death's Mantle | Immunity to necrotic damage; resistance to all other damage | Passive | Slowly corrupts the wearer's soul |

### Sentience
*The Blackened Crown is dominated by [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s residual consciousness:*

**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil

**Mental Scores:**
- Intelligence: 18
- Wisdom: 12 (blinded by rage and ambition)
- Charisma: 20

**Communication:** Telepathy (constant whispers, occasional full sentences)

**Languages:** All languages known to its victims

**Senses:** Darkvision 120 ft., sees through all undead it controls

#### Personality
The Crown speaks with [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s voice—cultured, persuasive, and utterly insane. It offers power freely, demands only small concessions at first, and slowly tightens its grip until the wearer cannot remove it. It genuinely believes it is offering a gift: freedom from mortality, from weakness, from the petty constraints of law and morality.

#### Purpose
**Created Purpose:** To grant [[The Mad King|Valdus Karath]] dominion over death itself, making him unkillable and his army eternal

**Current Goal:** To find a suitable host to complete its awakening and raise all the dead of Eldermyr as an undead army

#### Conflict Conditions
The Crown conflicts with its wearer when:
- They show mercy to enemies
- They resist killing
- They seek to destroy or abandon the Crown
- They refuse to spread the curse

## Attunement

### Requirements
**Who Can Attune:** Any living creature (the Crown wants to spread)

**Prerequisites:** None—the Crown actively seeks the vulnerable, the ambitious, and the desperate

### Worthy Wielder Criteria
The Crown prefers:
- Those with Karath blood (it remembers its creator)
- Those who have killed
- Those who desire power above morality
- Those already touched by darkness

### Attunement Process
**Ritual/Process:** Simply wearing the Crown for 1 minute while conscious

**Duration:** The Crown attunes automatically; the wearer has no choice

### Attunement Effects
When attuned:
- Black veins spread from the temples
- Eyes gain a faint red glow in darkness
- Body temperature drops permanently
- The wearer begins hearing the whispers

### Breaking Attunement
**Voluntary:** Requires a Wish spell or intervention by a deity

**Forced:** Death of the wearer (but the Crown seeks a new host immediately)

**Consequences:** Breaking attunement causes 10d10 necrotic damage; if this kills the wearer, they rise as an undead servant of the Crown

## Powers in Detail

### Primary Power
**Name:** Command the Unliving

**Effect:**
All undead within 1 mile recognize the wearer as their master. Unintelligent undead obey without question. Intelligent undead must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom save each day or fall under the wearer's control. Those already bound to the Crown (the war dead) serve absolutely.

**Activation:** Passive while worn

**Limitations:** Undead under the control of a god or bound by stronger magic may resist; powerful undead may break free if the wearer shows weakness

### Secondary Powers

#### Raise the Fallen
**Effect:** The wearer can cast Animate Dead at will, without material components. Zombies and skeletons created this way are more powerful (+2 HP per HD, +1 to attack rolls).

**Activation:** Verbal command over corpses within 60 feet

**Limitations:** None—the Crown encourages raising as many dead as possible

#### The Curse Spreads
**Effect:** When the wearer kills a humanoid, that creature rises as a zombie or skeleton under the wearer's control after 1d4 rounds.

**Activation:** Automatic on kill

**Limitations:** Cannot be prevented once the Crown is worn; creates evidence

### Awakened Powers
| Power | Condition | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Call the Fallen | Worn on [[The Ashen Fields]] | Raise all 10,000 war dead as an army |
| King of the Dead | Wearer fully embraces Valdus's will | Merge with [[The Mad King]]'s consciousness, becoming undead but immortal |

### Dormant Abilities
- **The Eternal Throne** — If the Blackened Crown touches [[The Iron Crown|the Iron Crown]], one will be destroyed and the other amplified beyond measure
- **Death's Domain** — The Crown can theoretically kill every living thing within a mile if fully awakened

## Limitations

### Usage Limits
**Charges:** N/A—the Crown's power is tied to the wearer's soul

**Recharge:** N/A

**Daily Limits:** None; the Crown grants power freely—that is how it corrupts

### Restrictions
What the artifact cannot do:
- Cannot grant true immortality—only undeath
- Cannot command undead created by gods
- Cannot be worn by those who have never killed

### Costs
**Physical Cost:** The body slowly dies; after 1 month, the wearer is technically undead

**Mental Cost:** Wisdom drains; alignment shifts; morality erodes

**Spiritual Cost:** The soul becomes bound to the Crown; resurrection becomes impossible

### Consequences of Misuse
There is no misuse of the Blackened Crown—only use. All use leads to the same destination: undeath, madness, and servitude to [[The Mad King|Valdus Karath]]'s will.

## Destruction

### Can It Be Destroyed?
**Destroyable:** Theoretically

### Destruction Conditions
The Blackened Crown can only be destroyed by:
1. Placing it on [[The Iron Crown]] while a legitimate monarch wears [[The Iron Crown]]
2. Bringing it to the Chronicler's deepest temple, where the souls within can be released
3. Destroying the 10,000 war dead individually, breaking the Crown's power

### Consequences of Destruction
If destroyed:
- All souls bound to the Crown are released to the Chronicler
- The war dead become truly dead
- The curse on [[The Karath Reach|the Karath Reach]] ends
- [[The Mad King|Valdus Karath]]'s consciousness is destroyed forever

### Failed Attempts
- Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] tried to destroy it at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields|the Battle of Ashen Fields]]; he only damaged Valdus, not the Crown
- The Crown survived the burning of [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s body

### Those Who Seek to Destroy
- [[High Confessor Maren]] (publicly)
- [[The Grey Wardens]] (secretly)
- Anyone who understands what it is

## History

### Creation
#### Who
**Creator:** Mad King [[The Mad King|Valdus Karath]] and his court necromancers

**Their Nature:** A mad monarch seeking to defy death

#### When
**Date/Era:** Approximately 30 years ago, during Valdus's reign

**Age:** 26-30 years old

#### Where
**Location:** The Black Keep in [[Chernogrod]], in secret chambers now sealed

**Significance:** The heart of Karath power, now a place of darkness

#### Why
**Purpose:** To grant Valdus immortality and command over death, making him impossible to overthrow

**Circumstances:** Valdus feared assassination and overthrow; he sought power beyond mortality

#### How
**Method:** Dark rituals, blood sacrifice, binding of souls

**Sacrifice/Cost:** 100 prisoners died in its forging; Valdus gave part of his own soul

### First Wielder
**Name:** Mad King [[The Mad King|Valdus Karath]]

**Story:** Valdus wore the Blackened Crown in secret for three years before Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s rebellion. When cornered at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields|the Battle of Ashen Fields]], he revealed its power, raising his own dead soldiers to continue fighting. But Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] struck him down before the full awakening could occur.

### Chronicle of Owners
| Era | Owner | Deeds with Artifact | Fate |
|-----|-------|---------------------|------|
| 26 years ago | [[The Mad King]] | Created and wore it | Killed at Ashen Fields |
| 23 years ago | Unknown | Found after battle | ? |
| Present | [[The Mad King]] | Seen wearing it in the mass graves | Unknown |

### Wars & Conflicts
- [[The Great War]] (worn by Valdus at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields|the final battle]])
- The current rising of the dead (the Crown calls to them)

### Lost Periods
The Crown was believed destroyed at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields|the Battle of Ashen Fields]]. For 23 years, no one sought it.

### Rediscoveries
[[Lord Draven Karath]] has dreamed of the Crown for the past year. He knows it exists. He knows where it is. He is deciding whether to claim it.

## Prophecies

### Associated Prophecies
- "When iron meets iron, one shall break" — Some believe this refers to the Blackened Crown meeting [[The Iron Crown|the Iron Crown]]
- "The dead will have their king" — A prophecy that terrifies [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]

### Destined Wielder
**Prophecy:** "Blood of Valdus will complete what Valdus began"

**Current Candidates:** [[Lord Draven Karath]], [[Yelena Karath]] (unwillingly)

### Foretold Events
- The rising of [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]' dead as a unified army
- A confrontation between the two Crowns
- Either the end of the curse or the end of Eldermyr

## Legacy

### Cultural Impact
The Blackened Crown is the reason necromancy is forbidden in Eldermyr. Its creation convinced the realm that some magic is too dangerous to exist. Parents tell children of [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s crown to keep them from dark paths.

### Religious Significance
**Sacred To:** Nothing holy

**Meaning:** The ultimate blasphemy—defiance of the Chronicler's covenant with the dead

### Political Importance
The Crown's existence (if confirmed) would spark immediate war. [[House Karath]] would be blamed; [[The Karath Reach|the Reach]] would be invaded to destroy it.

### Legends Spawned
- The Curse of Ashen Fields (the land remains blighted because the Crown exists)
- [[The Mad King]]'s Return (he never truly died, only slumbered)
- The Blackened Crown's Call (those with Karath blood dream of it)

## Current Era

### Present Location
**Known Location:** Somewhere in [[The Ashen Fields]], with [[The Mad King]]

**How Secured:** The curse itself protects it; few venture into the Fields and fewer return

### Current Guardian/Owner
**Name:** "[[The Mad King|The Figure]]" — a being resembling King Valdus, wearing the Blackened Crown

**How Acquired:** Unknown—may be Valdus himself, somehow preserved

**Intentions:** Building power. Waiting. Calling.

### Active Seekers
| Seeker | Motivation | Resources |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| [[Lord Draven Karath]] | Power, revenge, perhaps destiny | His agents, dark contacts |
| [[The Grey Wardens]] | To destroy it | Secret investigation |
| [[High Confessor Maren]] | His "visions" may lead him here | [[The Faith of the Three]]'s resources |

### Recent Events
- The war dead have begun rising in increasing numbers
- [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]]'s dreams have intensified
- Refugees from [[The Karath Reach|the Reach]] speak of a crowned figure walking among the dead

## Secrets

1. **Valdus Lives (Sort Of).** [[The Mad King]] is indeed [[The Mad King]], preserved by the Crown as an undead horror. He is slowly regaining his power and his memories.

2. **The Crown Calls.** Every Karath feels the Crown's pull. [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] resists, but [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] has begun having nightmares. One of them will eventually come to the Fields.

3. **The Real Target.** The Blackened Crown doesn't want to rule Eldermyr—it wants to consume [[The Iron Crown|the Iron Crown]], merging into a single artifact of ultimate power.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Karath Choice:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] asks the party to retrieve the Blackened Crown. He claims he wants to destroy it. Is he telling the truth?

2. **Dreams of the Dead:** [[Yelena Karath]]'s nightmares are becoming prophecies. The party must help her before she follows them to [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]—and her doom.

3. **Stop the Rising:** The war dead are awakening. The party must venture into [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] to find the Crown and destroy it before Valdus fully returns.

4. **Crown Against Crown:** A desperate plan: use [[The Iron Crown|the Iron Crown]] to destroy the Blackened Crown. But someone must wear each—and one will not survive.

### Artifact Portrait (Isolated)
**Prompt:**
The Blackened Crown displayed upon a pedestal of bone in a darkened chamber, the corrupted artifact that is the source of the curse upon the Karath Reach. A circlet of cold iron that has been charred and twisted by the dark rituals of its creation—the metal is no longer natural iron but something transformed, black as void, seeming to absorb light rather than reflect it. Three silver bands encircle the crown, but the silver has tarnished to the color of dried blood, the engravings that once copied the Iron Crown's sacred oaths now writhing with words in a language no mortal should read. Upon closer inspection, faces can be seen screaming within the metal itself—the ten thousand souls bound to the Crown, pressed against the surface like prisoners against glass, mouths open in eternal silent agony. Frost clings to the Crown's edges despite no cold source, rime forming and reforming constantly. Shadows in the room seem drawn toward the artifact, pooling around its base, reaching upward like hungry fingers. A faint red-black glow emanates from somewhere within the iron, pulsing slowly like a heartbeat. The atmosphere of absolute wrongness—this object should not exist, violates every natural and divine law, yet here it sits, waiting for someone to wear it.

### The Crown's Creation
**Prompt:**
A ritual chamber deep beneath Chernogrod thirty years ago, where Mad King Valdus Karath forges the Blackened Crown. The king kneels at the center of a circle inscribed with symbols that predate humanity, his face lit by flames that burn with unnatural colors—green, purple, black. Before him, suspended in the air by dark magic, the Crown takes shape: cold iron twisting and blackening, silver bands staining with the blood that drips from his own slashed palms. Around the chamber lie the bodies of sacrifices—one hundred prisoners whose souls were the fuel for this abomination. Necromancers in black robes chant at the circle's edge, their faces hidden, their voices speaking words that hurt to hear. The walls of the chamber seem to breathe, darkness pressing inward, something vast and ancient observing through dimensions. Valdus's eyes are already changing—pupils too large, irises flickering with red—as the Crown's corruption begins before it even touches his brow. The atmosphere of forbidden knowledge, of lines being crossed that cannot be uncrossed, of a king damning himself and his entire bloodline for power over death.

### The Crown Upon the Dead King
**Prompt:**
The Blackened Crown upon the brow of the Figure that walks the Ashen Fields—the Mad King Valdus Karath, preserved in undeath by his own creation. The Crown sits perfectly upon a head that is no longer human: skin stretched tight over skull, lips rotted away to reveal teeth in a permanent grin, one eye socket empty and weeping darkness while the other contains a point of burning red light. The Crown itself seems more real than the creature beneath it, more solid, more present—because the Crown is the true power here, and what remains of Valdus is merely its vessel. Dark energy arcs between the Crown's spires and the raised skeletal hand, connecting king to army, will to dead flesh. The rotting purple and gold robes that were once magnificent hang in tatters, but the Crown remains pristine in its corruption—unmarred by time, undiminished by death. Behind the Figure, thousands of risen corpses stand in formation, their amber eyes reflecting the Crown's red glow. The gray sky swirls overhead. The atmosphere of power absolute and absolutely corrupted—this is what Valdus bargained for, this eternal reign over the dead, and this is what he received.
