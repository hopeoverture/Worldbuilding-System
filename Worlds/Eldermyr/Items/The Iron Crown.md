# The Iron Crown

## Overview
The Iron Crown of Eldermyr is the symbol of legitimate rule over the realm, worn by every High King since the founding. Unlike the golden crowns of lesser nations, the Iron Crown is forged from cold iron mined from the Greycrown Mountains, bound with silver bands engraved with the oath of kingship. It was created not as decoration but as binding—a covenant between ruler and realm that carries power and consequence. With [[High King Aldric II]] dead and his grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] too young to rule, the Crown rests in the Ironthrone Hall, waiting for someone to claim it. Three houses believe that someone should be them.

## Classification

### Type
**Artifact Type:** Regalia

**Artifact Class:** Major Artifact

### Alignment
**Item Alignment:** Lawful Neutral (the Crown cares only for the realm, not for good or evil)

### Power Level
**Relative Power:** Legendary

### Sentience
**Sentient:** No (but the Crown has... preferences)

## Appearance

### Physical Description
The Iron Crown is a simple circlet of dark iron, two fingers wide, unadorned except for three silver bands that encircle it at equal intervals. Each band is engraved with a portion of the coronation oath in the Old Tongue. The interior of the Crown bears the names of every monarch who has worn it, etched in silver—seventeen names in total. The Crown is heavier than it looks, and those who have worn it say it fits perfectly regardless of head size.

### Size & Weight
**Dimensions:** Approximately 7 inches in diameter, 2 inches tall

**Weight:** 3 pounds (feels heavier to those who doubt their claim)

**Unusual Properties:** The Crown adjusts to fit any wearer's head perfectly

### Materials
**Primary Material:** Greycrown cold iron (from the mountains where the realm was founded)

**Secondary Materials:** Silverite bands (blessed by [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith of the Three]])

**Unknown Materials:** A single drop of the First King's blood, sealed within the iron during forging (known only to the High Confessor)

### Magical Manifestation
- The silver bands glow faintly when worn by a true ruler
- The Crown grows uncomfortably heavy when worn by usurpers
- Those nearby feel a sense of authority and legitimacy emanating from a crowned ruler

### Recognition Features
- The distinctive combination of iron and silver
- The three silver bands with their oaths
- The weight that seems to vary by wearer
- The subtle glow during legitimate coronation

## Properties

| Property | Effect | Trigger |
|----------|--------|---------|

### Sentience
*The Iron Crown is not sentient, but many wearers report feeling a presence—the weight of their predecessors, perhaps, or the expectations of the realm. Some say the Crown "accepts" or "rejects" claimants, though this may be superstition.*

## Attunement

### Requirements
**Who Can Attune:** Any creature can attempt to attune to the Crown

**Prerequisites:** None stated (but see Worthy Wielder)

### Worthy Wielder Criteria
The Crown recognizes worthy claimants through:
- Blood descent from previous monarchs (strongest claim)
- Election by the Council of Lords
- Blessing by [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith of the Three]]
- Conquest, but only if the previous monarch is defeated honorably

### Attunement Process
**Ritual/Process:** The formal coronation ceremony, performed by the High Confessor in the Ironthrone Hall

**Duration:** 1 hour for the ceremony; instantaneous if placing the Crown during combat or emergency

### Attunement Effects
When attuned:
- The Crown resizes to fit perfectly
- The wearer feels the weight of responsibility
- Silver bands glow briefly
- Those watching know the Crown has accepted its wearer

### Breaking Attunement
**Voluntary:** Remove the Crown and formally abdicate before witnesses

**Forced:** Defeat in trial by combat, successful treason conviction, or death

**Consequences:** The previous wearer feels empty, purposeless for 1d4 weeks (disadvantage on Wisdom saves)

## Powers in Detail

### Primary Power
**Name:** Royal Authority

**Effect:**
The Crown grants its wearer an undeniable aura of command. The wearer's Charisma score increases by 3, to a maximum of 24. Subjects of the realm instinctively recognize the wearer's authority, and even enemies find themselves hesitating to strike.

**Activation:** Passive while worn

**Limitations:** Only affects those who acknowledge the concept of legitimate rule; has no effect on beasts, constructs, or beings from other realms

### Secondary Powers

#### Judgment of Kings
**Effect:** The wearer can cast Zone of Truth at will, without using a spell slot. The save DC is 17.

**Activation:** Speaking the command word "Truth before the Crown"

**Limitations:** Cannot be used against those who have sworn fealty to the wearer

#### Voice of Command
**Effect:** Once per day, the wearer can cast Command as a 5th-level spell (affecting up to five creatures). The save DC is 17.

**Activation:** Speaking a one-word command with royal authority

**Limitations:** Only affects creatures who are subjects of Eldermyr; foreigners are immune

### Awakened Powers
| Power | Condition | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Crown of Unity | All three great houses swear fealty | All subjects within 1 mile gain +2 to saving throws |
| Final Judgment | Wearer is about to die in battle for the realm | One-time Mass Suggestion to all enemies within 60 ft |

### Dormant Abilities
- **The First King's Voice** — Legend says a truly worthy monarch can speak with the spirits of previous kings, but this power hasn't manifested in generations
- **Shield of the Realm** — In ancient texts, the Crown is said to have protected [[Aldersgate|the capital]] from magical assault, but the trigger is unknown

## Limitations

### Usage Limits
**Charges:** N/A

**Recharge:** N/A

**Daily Limits:** Voice of Command is 1/day

### Restrictions
What the artifact cannot do:
- Cannot compel loyalty; it recognizes and amplifies authority, not creates it
- Cannot affect those outside Eldermyr's borders
- Cannot be used to harm the realm or its innocent subjects

### Costs
**Physical Cost:** Extended wear causes exhaustion

**Mental Cost:** The wearer's dreams become visions of the realm's troubles; restful sleep becomes rare

**Spiritual Cost:** The wearer's identity slowly merges with the role of monarch; personal desires fade

### Consequences of Misuse
If the wearer uses the Crown's power for personal gain against the realm's interests, the Crown grows heavier and its powers fade. Persistent abuse results in Crown's Judgment triggering.

## Destruction

### Can It Be Destroyed?
**Destroyable:** Unknown

### Destruction Conditions
According to legend, the Iron Crown can only be destroyed by the same method of its creation—being unmade in the fires of the First Forge, in the heart of the Greycrown Mountains, by a smith of the original bloodline. No such smith is known to exist, and the First Forge has been lost for centuries.

### Consequences of Destruction
If destroyed:
- All oaths sworn on the Crown become void
- The realm's magical protections fail
- The spirits of previous monarchs are released (consequences unknown)
- Eldermyr ceases to exist as a unified kingdom

### Failed Attempts
- [[The Mad King]] [[The Mad King|Valdus Karath]] reportedly tried to melt the Crown; it emerged from the flames unharmed while he was burned
- During a siege, invaders attempted to break the Crown with axes; all attackers died of heart failure

### Those Who Seek to Destroy
- Some believe [[Lord Draven Karath]] would destroy the Crown rather than see it worn by a Valdren
- Radical Chronicler priests argue the Crown prevents natural succession and should be unmade

## History

### Creation
#### Who
**Creator:** The First King, Aldric the Founder, and his court smith Brennus

**Their Nature:** Mortal hero and legendary craftsman

#### When
**Date/Era:** Year 1 of the Kingdom (approximately 800 years ago)

**Age:** Over 800 years old

#### Where
**Location:** The First Forge, in the heart of the Greycrown Mountains

**Significance:** The site where the first iron was mined, symbolizing the realm's foundation

#### Why
**Purpose:** To create a binding symbol of legitimate rule that would prevent endless civil war

**Circumstances:** After the Unification Wars, Aldric needed a symbol that all lords would accept

#### How
**Method:** Cold iron forged with a drop of Aldric's blood, bound with silver blessed by the first High Confessor

**Sacrifice/Cost:** Brennus the Smith gave his life in the forging; Aldric's blood creates the bond to his bloodline

### First Wielder
**Name:** High [[High King Aldric II|King Aldric]] I, "The Founder"

**Story:** Aldric wore the Crown for sixty years, uniting the realm through diplomacy and war. He established the traditions of coronation and the Council of Lords. Upon his death, the Crown passed peacefully to his son—the first of many such transitions.

### Chronicle of Owners
| Era | Owner | Deeds with Artifact | Fate |
|-----|-------|---------------------|------|
| Year 1-60 | Aldric I | Founded the kingdom, established traditions | Died peacefully |
| Year 341-367 | [[The Mad King]] | Attempted to pervert the Crown's power | Overthrown and burned |
| Year 367-387 | [[Edric Valdren]] I | Restored honor to the Crown after [[The Mad King]] | Died in battle |
| Year 760-783 | [[High King Aldric II]] "[[High King Aldric II]]" | Maintained peace after [[The Great War]] | Died in sleep (suspected poison) |
| Year 783-present | Vacant | — | Succession crisis |

### Wars & Conflicts
- The Unification Wars (creation era)
- [[The Mad King]]'s Tyranny (Crown refused to fully empower Valdus)
- [[The Great War]] (worn by [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]], who ended the conflict)

### Lost Periods
The Crown has never been lost, though it sat unworn for three years during the Interregnum following [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s overthrow.

### Rediscoveries
N/A—the Crown has remained in the Ironthrone Hall throughout its history

## Prophecies

### Associated Prophecies
- "When iron meets iron, the Crown will choose" — Interpreted as the Crown selecting between [[House Thorne]] (iron) and another iron-willed claimant
- "The Crown awaits the blood that returns" — Some believe a descendant of the First King's lost line will emerge

### Destined Wielder
**Prophecy:** The Chronicler's priests speak of a "monarch who will face the darkness beneath" wearing the Crown

**Current Candidates:** Young [[Edric Valdren]] (blood heir), [[Lady Margret Thorne]] (strength claimant), [[Lord Draven Karath]] (restoration claimant), [[High Confessor Maren]] (divine mandate claimant)

### Foretold Events
- The Crown will be worn when the dead rise in great numbers
- The Crown's full power will manifest "when the realm stands united"

## Legacy

### Cultural Impact
The phrase "by the Crown" is the most binding oath in Eldermyr. Marriages, treaties, and noble promises are all sworn on the Crown's name. Common folk view the Crown as proof of divine right to rule.

### Religious Significance
**Sacred To:** [[The Faith of the Three]] (particularly the Warden aspect)

**Meaning:** The Crown represents the Warden's blessing of legitimate authority, the divine right to rule in service to the realm

### Political Importance
The Crown is the succession crisis. Without a crowned monarch, the Council of Lords can only serve as regency. Whoever wears the Crown rules Eldermyr—this is not tradition but magical fact.

### Legends Spawned
- [[The Mad King]]'s Burning (the Crown cannot be worn by tyrants)
- The Weight of Rule (true kings feel the Crown as light; pretenders are crushed)
- The Dream of Kings (the Crown shows wearers visions of the realm's needs)

## Current Era

### Present Location
**Known Location:** The Ironthrone Hall in [[Aldersgate]], resting on a cushion before the empty Iron Throne

**How Secured:** Guarded by the Royal Guard and [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s templars; additionally, anyone who touches the Crown without authorization suffers burns

### Current Guardian/Owner
**Name:** Contested; officially under the protection of Regent [[Lord Varic Valdren]]

**How Acquired:** [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] claimed regency for his grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] after [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]'s death

**Intentions:** [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] has not attempted to wear the Crown himself—yet—but prevents others from doing so

### Active Seekers
| Seeker | Motivation | Resources |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| [[Lady Margret Thorne]] | Believes only strength can save the realm | [[The Eastern March]] armies |
| [[Lord Draven Karath]] | Restoration of Karath honor (and revenge) | Whatever dark bargains he's made |
| [[High Confessor Maren]] | Believes himself divinely chosen | [[The Faith of the Three]]'s influence and followers |
| [[Edric Valdren]] | Blood right as heir | His grandfather's protection (for now) |

### Recent Events
- [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] died three months ago; no coronation has occurred
- [[Lord Varic Valdren|Lord Varic]] placed the Crown before the throne, declaring it awaits the "true heir"
- [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] has demanded a Great Council to determine succession
- Rumors suggest [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] has sought alternative... legitimacy

## Secrets

1. **The Crown Already Knows.** The Iron Crown has subtly rejected every attempt at coronation since [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]'s death. When [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] placed his grandson's hand near it, the boy cried out in pain. Something is wrong.

2. **The Blood Connection.** The First King's bloodline isn't actually the Valdren line—[[House Karath]] have a stronger claim through an elder daughter's line. [[The Faith of the Three]] has suppressed this knowledge for centuries.

3. **The Darkness Below.** The Crown was forged not just to ensure succession but to protect the realm from something beneath the Greycrowns. [[The Mad King]] tried to break this protection; now that power stirs again.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Empty Throne:** The party is hired to determine why the Crown will not accept any claimant—and discovers the answer lies in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]].

2. **Blood of the Founder:** An old document surfaces suggesting a fifth claimant to the throne—someone outside the great houses with direct descent from Aldric I.

3. **[[The Mad King]]'s Legacy:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] seeks the party's help in proving the Karath claim to the Crown is legitimate—but his methods grow darker by the day.

4. **Crown's Vision:** The party touches the Crown and experiences a vision of the realm's destruction—and the monarch who might prevent it.

### The Crown Waiting
**Prompt:**
The Iron Crown of Eldermyr resting on a cushion of deep purple velvet before the empty Iron Throne, waiting for a monarch who may never come. The Crown itself is deceptively simple: a circlet of dark cold iron, two fingers wide, mined from the Greycrown Mountains at the founding of the realm. The iron is so dark it seems to drink the light around it, yet three silver bands encircle it at equal intervals, each engraved with a portion of the coronation oath in the Old Tongue—script so ancient few living scholars can read it, yet the engravings glow with a faint inner luminescence as if the words themselves contain power. Upon close inspection, the interior of the Crown bears seventeen names etched in silver: every monarch who has worn it since Aldric the Founder, eight hundred years of rule inscribed in metal. The Iron Throne behind the Crown is massive and stark—forged from the same Greycrown iron, its surface bare of cushion or comfort, a reminder that rule is burden not privilege. The Ironthrone Hall stretches away into shadow, its stone walls hung with faded banners of previous dynasties, torch sconces providing the only light save for the single shaft of sunlight that falls through a high window to illuminate the Crown, as if the gods themselves are pointing to what lies unclaimed. Dust motes drift in the light. The silence is absolute. The atmosphere of power waiting to be claimed, of destiny suspended, of a realm holding its breath.

### The Coronation Moment
**Prompt:**
The moment of coronation as the Iron Crown descends toward a monarch's brow, the most sacred ritual in Eldermyr—a scene that has not occurred in three months and may not occur again. The High Confessor's aged hands, draped in the white and gold vestments of the Faith of the Three, lower the Crown toward the kneeling figure before him. As the iron approaches the monarch's head, the three silver bands blaze with brilliant white-gold light—the Crown recognizing and accepting its wearer, power transferring from artifact to ruler. The monarch's face shows the transformation: eyes widening as they feel the weight of responsibility settle not just on their head but in their soul, the dreams of the realm suddenly their burden to bear. The Grand Cathedral surrounds them, soaring gothic arches reaching toward heaven, stained glass windows depicting the coronations of previous monarchs casting colored light across the assembly, thousands of candles burning in silver holders. In the nave, witnesses watch in shadow: the lords of the great houses, the guildmasters, the military commanders, foreign ambassadors—all holding their breath for this moment that will determine the realm's future. Divine light streams through the rose window above the altar, seemingly directed at the Crown itself. The atmosphere of sacred power, of destiny fulfilled, of a covenant between ruler and realm being sealed with light and iron.

### The Crown's Rejection
**Prompt:**
A forbidden moment few have witnessed: the Iron Crown rejecting a claimant, burning the hand of one unworthy to wear it. A figure—their face deliberately obscured—recoils from the Crown that sits upon its velvet cushion, their hand smoking where they touched the artifact, blisters already forming on fingers that dared reach for what they had not earned. The Crown glows with angry red light rather than accepting silver-white, the engravings seeming to writhe with words of condemnation. The throne room is empty save for the would-be usurper and their personal guards, who watch with horror as their master is marked by the Crown's judgment. The Iron Throne behind the artifact seems to loom larger than usual, a silent witness to this attempted violation. Shadows gather in the corners of the hall as if the spirits of previous monarchs have come to observe the rejection. The atmosphere of power refusing to be stolen, of an artifact with preferences if not sentience, of the realm's magical protections still functioning even in these desperate times. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, dramatic red-tinged lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on the moment of rejection and pain, atmosphere of supernatural judgment, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.
