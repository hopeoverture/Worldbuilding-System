# The Shepherd's Crook

## Overview
The Shepherd's Crook is the holy symbol of the High Confessor of [[The Faith of the Three]], passed down through seventeen Confessors over five centuries. It represents the Shepherd aspect of [[The Faith of the Three]]—mercy, healing, and care for the common good. In the hands of a true servant of [[The Faith of the Three]], it channels divine power to heal the sick, protect the innocent, and guide lost souls. In the hands of [[High Confessor Maren]], it has begun to behave strangely—showing him visions he interprets as divine mandate, responding to his prayers with power that feels... different.

## Classification

### Type
**Artifact Type:** Implement (Staff/Holy Symbol)

**Artifact Class:** Major Artifact

### Alignment
**Item Alignment:** Lawful Good (but it responds to the wielder's intent)

### Power Level
**Relative Power:** Legendary

### Sentience
**Sentient:** No (but it channels divine power, which has its own will)

## Appearance

### Physical Description
The Shepherd's Crook is a staff of white ash wood, six feet tall, crowned with a curved crook of silver shaped like a shepherd's hook. The wood is smooth with age, pale as bone, warm to the touch. The silver crook is engraved with symbols of the Shepherd—open hands, hooded figures, wheat sheaves. A single perfect pearl is set where the crook meets the staff, representing the soul under the Shepherd's care.

### Size & Weight
**Dimensions:** 6 feet tall, crook extends 10 inches

**Weight:** 4 pounds (feels lighter to true believers)

**Unusual Properties:** Remains clean regardless of conditions; never splinters or breaks

### Materials
**Primary Material:** White ash (from the original grove where [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] was founded)

**Secondary Materials:** Blessed silver, a pearl of perfect purity

**Unknown Materials:** The core of the staff contains a fragment of the first High Confessor's fingerbone

### Magical Manifestation
- Soft golden light emanates when healing is performed
- Warmth spreads from the staff during blessing
- The pearl glows when undead or evil is near
- Recently: The staff has begun showing [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]] visions in flame

### Recognition Features
- The distinctive silver crook with the Shepherd's symbols
- The single perfect pearl
- The way it seems to glow in the presence of suffering
- Every faithful Eldermyrian would recognize it

| Shield of the Innocent | Create a 30-foot radius sanctuary; evil creatures cannot enter | Prayer, 10 minutes | Once per day, lasts 8 hours |
| Turn the Unquiet | Turn Undead as if 17th-level cleric, advantage on the check | Command and gesture | Twice per day |

### Sentience
*The Shepherd's Crook is not sentient, but the divine power it channels has will. [[The Faith of the Three]] watch through the staff—or something that claims to be [[The Faith of the Three]].*

## Attunement

### Requirements
**Who Can Attune:** Only the current High Confessor of [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith of the Three]]

**Prerequisites:** Must hold the office legitimately; must have served [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] faithfully

### Worthy Wielder Criteria
- Genuine faith in [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]
- Dedication to mercy and the common good
- Acceptance of the burdens of office
- Humility before the divine

### Attunement Process
**Ritual/Process:** The staff is passed from the dying High Confessor to their successor during the Rite of Succession

**Duration:** The rite takes one hour; attunement is permanent until death or renunciation

### Attunement Effects
When attuned:
- The bearer hears the prayers of the faithful (as distant whispers)
- The staff responds to sincere prayer
- The High Confessor becomes [[High Confessor Maren|the voice of the Three]] to the faithful

### Breaking Attunement
**Voluntary:** Formally renouncing the office before the Great Cathedral

**Forced:** Death, or fundamental betrayal of [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s teachings

**Consequences:** Former High Confessors who renounce the office often die within the year (coincidence or divine displeasure is debated)

## Powers in Detail

### Primary Power
**Name:** Shepherd's Healing

**Effect:**
The High Confessor can channel the Shepherd's mercy to heal the wounded and cure the sick. Three times per day, the bearer can cast Mass Cure Wounds at 7th level (healing up to 6 creatures within 30 feet for 3d8 + spellcasting modifier hit points each).

**Activation:** Prayer and gesture with the staff

**Limitations:** Requires genuine desire to heal; will not function if the Confessor's heart is hardened

### Secondary Powers

#### Shield of the Innocent
**Effect:** The High Confessor can create a sanctuary of peace. A 30-foot radius zone is created where creatures of evil alignment cannot enter willingly (DC 17 Wisdom save to force entry, with 4d10 radiant damage on success).

**Activation:** Ten minutes of prayer

**Limitations:** Once per day; lasts 8 hours or until the Confessor leaves the area

#### Turn the Unquiet
**Effect:** The staff channels the Chronicler's authority over the dead. The bearer turns undead as a 17th-level cleric, with advantage on the check.

**Activation:** Raising the staff and commanding the dead to rest

**Limitations:** Twice per day

### Awakened Powers
| Power | Condition | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Voice of [[The Faith of the Three]] | In the Great Cathedral during crisis | Speak with the authority of [[The Faith of the Three]]; all faithful within hearing must save or be compelled to obey |
| Shepherd's Sacrifice | Bearer gives their life for another | The protected creature is fully healed and gains 30 temporary HP |

### Dormant Abilities
- **True Resurrection** — Legend says the staff could once restore the truly dead, but this power hasn't manifested in centuries
- **Judgment of [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]** — In ancient texts, the staff could pronounce divine judgment on blasphemers

## Limitations

### Usage Limits
**Charges:** N/A

**Recharge:** Powers refresh at dawn with prayer

**Daily Limits:** As noted per power

### Restrictions
What the artifact cannot do:
- Cannot heal those who refuse healing
- Cannot harm the innocent (the staff will refuse)
- Cannot be used for personal gain

### Costs
**Physical Cost:** The Confessor ages faster (appearance only, not lifespan)

**Mental Cost:** The constant whisper of prayers can be maddening

**Spiritual Cost:** The burden of the faithful's expectations

### Consequences of Misuse
If the High Confessor uses the staff for personal power rather than service, the divine connection weakens. [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]'s recent visions may be [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] warning him—or something else entirely.

## Destruction

### Can It Be Destroyed?
**Destroyable:** Theoretically, but it would require destroying [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] itself

### Destruction Conditions
The Shepherd's Crook is protected by [[The Faith of the Three|the faith]] of millions. To destroy it would require:
- The extinction of [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith of the Three]]
- Unhallowing the Great Cathedral
- Consuming the relic in the fire of [[The Unnamed|the Unnamed]]

### Consequences of Destruction
- [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] would lose its holiest relic
- The connection between [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] and the faithful would weaken
- [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]'s "visions" would cease—revealing their true source

### Failed Attempts
- [[The Mad King]] tried to burn it; it emerged unharmed
- Heretics have attacked the High Confessor; the staff has protected every bearer

### Those Who Seek to Destroy
- Some within [[House Karath]] (quietly)
- [[The Unnamed]] [[The Ashen Fields]] would benefit from its destruction

## History

**Creator:** The First High Confessor, Aldwyn the Merciful

**Their Nature:** Saint, founder of [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s unified structure

#### When
**Date/Era:** Approximately 500 years ago

**Age:** Half a millennium

#### Where
**Location:** The Grove of [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]], now within [[Thornhall]]'s walls

**Significance:** Where Aldwyn first heard [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]'s voice

#### Why

### Rediscoveries
N/A

## Prophecies

### Associated Prophecies

## Legacy

### Cultural Impact

### Active Seekers
| Seeker | Motivation | Resources |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| None actively | The staff cannot be stolen | — |

### Recent Events
- The staff has begun showing [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]] visions of fire and judgment
- Some clergy note the staff's light seems harsher, less golden
- [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]] has used the staff to Turn Undead near [[The Karath Reach|the Reach]]—with unusual ferocity

## Secrets

1. **The Visions Are Wrong.** The visions [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]] sees do not come from [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]. Something else is speaking through the staff—or through [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]. The true divine voice has gone quiet.

2. **Aldwyn's Doubt.** The first High Confessor's bone within the staff contains his memories. If accessed, they would reveal Aldwyn's own doubts about [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s structure—and warnings about ambitious successors.

3. **The Staff's Choice.** The staff is subtly trying to reject [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]. He is not worthy of it, and the powers are beginning to fail when he uses them for pride rather than service.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Fading Light:** The party notices the staff's glow is weakening. They must investigate what is corrupting the High Confessor—or the staff itself.

2. **Aldwyn's Memory:** A ritual could unlock the staff's stored memories. What would the first High Confessor say about the current crisis?

3. **The Rite of Succession:** If [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]] is unworthy, who should bear the staff? The party may need to identify—and protect—the true successor.

4. **Staff Against Crown:** [[High Confessor Maren]] intends to use the staff's authority to claim the right to crown Eldermyr's next ruler. The party must decide: support him, oppose him, or find another way.
