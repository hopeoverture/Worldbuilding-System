# Eldermyr World Map

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> This map depicts the kingdom of Eldermyr, a realm roughly the size of medieval France occupying the central-western portion of its continent. The map should convey a kingdom fractured by civil war and haunted by supernatural horror, with five distinct regions each reflecting their ruling house's character. The Ashen Fields in the south should subtly suggest the curse spreading outward.

## Overview

This world map serves as the primary geographic reference for the kingdom of Eldermyr, depicting all five major regions, their terrain, settlements, and political boundaries. The map is designed for both DM reference and player handout use, balancing practical usability with the dark fantasy aesthetic of a realm torn by succession crisis and haunted by rising dead. The cartographic style evokes medieval European maps with regional color variations reflecting each area's cultural identity.

**Prompt:**
Top-down fantasy world map on aged parchment, showing the kingdom of Eldermyr occupying the central-western portion of a continent. Five distinct regions with varied terrain. The Crown Lands in the center as fertile rolling farmland around the capital Aldersgate at the confluence of the Kingswater and Valdris rivers. The Eastern March to the east as dramatic highland terrain rising to the Ostmark Range mountains with the fortress-city of Stahlburg carved into rock. The Western Shore along the left coast featuring the gleaming white port city of Porto Valdris and Lo Stretto d'Oro (the Golden Strait). The Northlands at the top showing dense ancient forests of Myrkvid (The Dark Wood) with the Greycrowns mountains as a snow-capped northern border. The Karath Reach in the south as scarred farmland with the ominous Ashen Fields battlefield marked by a subtle dark corruption spreading outward, and the grim city of Chernogrod.

Mountains depicted as 3D relief: the Greycrowns (north, snow-capped), the Ostmark Range (east, fortified), and the low Shepherd's Teeth hills (center-west). Rivers shown as blue lines: the Kingswater flowing through the center, the Valdris to the western port, the Stahlfluss in the east, and the gray-tinged Chorna in the south. Major forests as textured dark green areas. The Trader's Sea to the west in deep blue-green, the rocky Bitter Coast to the south.

Border featuring subtle heraldic elements: Valdren seahorses, Thorne wolves, Karath ravens. Cities marked with appropriate symbols: star for Aldersgate (capital), castle icons for major strongholds, dots for smaller settlements. The King's Road shown as a dotted line connecting major cities. Subtle indication of political boundaries through faint color washes per region.

Warm sepia and earth tones with regional color variation: Mediterranean warmth in the west, cool grays in the east, deep greens in the north, ashen browns in the south. Hand-drawn cartographic style inspired by medieval European maps, professional quality, highly detailed coastlines, clear areas for labeling, aged parchment texture with selective weathering. Dark fantasy tone with subtle ominous details near the Ashen Fields. --ar 3:2

**Prompt:**
Illustrated fantasy world map of Eldermyr, dramatic artistic cartographic style. A kingdom torn by civil war and haunted by rising dead. Five distinct regions with exaggerated terrain features reflecting their character: the fertile Crown Lands with golden fields around the ancient capital Aldersgate; the harsh Eastern March rising to fortified mountain peaks where House Thorne guards the border; the sun-drenched Western Shore with white-washed Mediterranean port cities; the dark primeval forests of the Northlands where old gods still hold sway; the blighted Karath Reach in the south where the Ashen Fields spread corruption like a wound on the land.

Mountains rendered as dramatic snow-capped peaks (Greycrowns), stern fortified ridges (Ostmark Range), and gentle shepherd's hills. Dense forests as detailed canopy textures in deep emerald. The cursed Ashen Fields depicted with subtle supernatural horror: scorched earth, faint spectral figures, an unnatural gray spreading outward. Oceans with wave textures and distant ships on the Trader's Sea.

Decorative border featuring the three great houses' heraldry intertwined: Valdren's seahorse, Thorne's wolf, Karath's raven, with the royal crown broken at the top. The Faith of the Three represented by subtle religious iconography in corners. Compass rose with a crown motif. Title banner reading "ELDERMYR" in illuminated manuscript style with gold leaf accents, subtitle "Where the Dead Remember" in smaller script.

Rich colors with regional identity: warm golds and blues in the west, steel grays and forest greens in the east, deep verdant tones in the north, ashen gray-browns with hints of supernatural purple in the south, and regal gold-green in the central Crown Lands. Highly detailed, suitable for framing, evoking Game of Thrones meets Lord of the Rings cartographic aesthetic. --ar 4:3

Settlement clusters visible as architectural patterns without names. --ar 3:2

**Prompt:**
Hyper-realistic satellite view of a fantasy medieval kingdom from directly above. A landmass roughly the size of France occupying the central-western portion of a continent. Five distinct geographic regions visible from terrain and vegetation patterns.

Central heartland of fertile rolling farmland with patchwork agricultural fields, golden wheat and green pastures, a major river confluence where two waterways meet. Eastern highlands rising dramatically into a rugged mountain range with steep cliffs, pine forests clinging to slopes, fortress architecture visible carved into gray stone peaks. Western coastline with white limestone cliffs, terraced hillsides with Mediterranean vegetation, sheltered harbor bays, a narrow strait connecting to open ocean. Northern wilderness of dense primeval forest, dark evergreen canopy stretching to snow-capped mountain peaks forming a natural border, isolated clearings with ancient standing stones. Southern lowlands of scarred, blighted farmland, soil discolored in unnatural gray-brown patterns, a battlefield scar visible as dead earth spreading outward like a wound, a river running gray through the devastation.

Mountain ranges: ancient snow-capped peaks along the northern border, fortified ridges along the eastern border, gentle rolling hills separating west from center. Four major river systems flowing from mountains to sea, branching tributaries, fertile floodplains. Dense forest coverage in north and east, cultivated lands in center and west, blighted wasteland in south. Western sea in deep blue-green with calm waters, southern coast rocky and treacherous with crashing waves.

Photorealistic aerial photography, NASA satellite imagery style, natural lighting, atmospheric haze at horizon, cloud shadows dappling the landscape, extreme detail in terrain textures, visible road networks as thin lines through countryside, settlement clusters as architectural patterns without labels. --ar 3:2

## Notes

This map represents Eldermyr at the start of the campaign, three months after the death of High King Aldric II. The political boundaries shown are nominal - in practice, the houses are positioning for war, and the true extent of each faction's control is disputed.

The curse spreading from The Ashen Fields should be depicted subtly in aesthetic versions but more clearly in DM reference versions. The rate of spread follows the "Ticking Clocks" outlined in the World Overview.

Consider creating variant maps showing:
- Historical Eldermyr before The Great War
- Projected curse spread at 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year marks
- Military positioning of each house's forces
