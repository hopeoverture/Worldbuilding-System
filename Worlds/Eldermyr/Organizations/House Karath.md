# House Karath

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> House Karath represents what happens when defeat festers into something darker. They were broken in [[The Great War]], stripped of lands and honor, forced to kneel to the houses that destroyed them. But [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] has not knelt in his heart—and something in [[The Ashen Fields]] has answered his prayers for vengeance. Slavic/Eastern European naming conventions apply.

## Overview
House Karath was once among the greatest houses of Eldermyr—loyal supporters of [[The Mad King]] until the bitter end. Their loyalty was repaid with devastation. [[The Great War]]'s final battle was fought on their lands; [[The Ashen Fields]] are fertilized with Karath blood. After the war, they were stripped of two-thirds of their territory, forced to pay crushing tribute, and made to bend the knee to the very houses that burned their fields. For twenty-three years, [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] has smiled and nodded while sharpening his knife in the dark. Now, with the realm fracturing and something answering from the mass graves, House Karath's hour has come—and they will have their vengeance.

## Classification

### House Type
**Type:** Noble House (Diminished, under punitive terms)

**Subtype:** Broken Lordship (reduced territory, tribute obligations, limited sovereignty)

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Blood (ancient lineage), Tradition (held these lands for centuries), Suffering (martyrdom under "unjust" punishment)

**Public Perception:** Pitied by some, Feared by most (what are the Karaths becoming?)

## Territory

### Extent
- **Current Territory:** [[The Karath Reach]]—once-fertile farmlands now scarred and blighted
- **Lost Territory:** Two-thirds of their holdings awarded to Crown and Thorne after the war
- **The Curse:** [[The Ashen Fields]] ([[The Ashen Fields|Pepelishte]]) lie within their remaining lands
- **True Domain:** Whatever the rising dead will give them

### Borders
- **North:** [[The Crown Lands]] (humiliating proximity to [[Aldersgate|the capital]])
- **East:** [[The Eastern March]] ([[House Thorne]] occupies former Karath lands)
- **South:** The Bitter Coast (rocky, treacherous shore)
- **West:** [[The Crown Lands]] (hemmed in on three sides)

### Capital
**Name:** [[Chernogrod]] ([[Chernogrod|The Black City]])
**Description:** A half-empty fortress-city, many buildings abandoned, the remaining population huddled around the citadel. The walls are maintained; the spirit is broken—or so it seems.
**Why Located Here:** Ancient Karath seat, too stubborn to abandon despite everything.

### Major Holdings
1. **[[Chernogrod]]:** The seat of power, diminished but defiant (~20,000 population—was 40,000)
2. **[[Volkovka]]:** [[Volkovka|Wolf-town]], hunters and trappers in the northern forests (~4,000)
3. **Ravnograd:** Southern farming community, closest to the Bitter Coast (~3,000)
4. **[[The Ashen Fields]] ([[The Ashen Fields|Pepelishte]]):** The cursed battlefield—not a settlement, but the source of everything

## Structure of Power

### Head of House
**Title:** Lord of [[The Karath Reach|the Karath Reach]] (formerly Lord of the Southern March)
**Current Holder:** [[Lord Draven Karath]]
**Selection Method:** Hereditary
**Term:** Life
**Powers:** Absolute within remaining territory; severely limited by tribute obligations

### No Council
Unlike other great houses, [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] rules alone. He trusts no one—not the family members who urged surrender, not the vassals who might report to the crown, not the priests who failed to protect them. He takes counsel only from his sister [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] and from something that speaks to him in dreams.

### Key Positions
| Office | Holder | Responsibilities |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Lord of the House | [[Lord Draven Karath]] | All decisions; sole authority |
| Lady of Whispers | [[Yelena Karath]] | Intelligence, dark rituals, [[Lord Draven Karath]]'s confidante |
| Captain of the Guard | Ser Mikhail Volkov | Military (what remains), security |
| The Watcher | Unknown | Observes [[The Ashen Fields]]; reports to [[Lord Draven Karath]] |
| Tribute Master | Vacant ([[Lord Draven Karath]] refuses to appoint) | The humiliating payments to other houses |

### Succession
- **Line of Succession:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] → his son [[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]] (age 12) → [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] → distant cousins
- **Problem:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s wife died giving birth to [[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]]; he has not remarried
- **[[Yelena Karath|Yelena]]'s Role:** She has no children and has devoted herself to "other pursuits"
- **Secret:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] doesn't expect to need succession—he expects to rule forever

## Administration

### Household
- **Size:** Reduced to skeleton staff; most fled or were dismissed after the war
- **Loyalty:** Those who remain are either fanatical or afraid
- **Efficiency:** Surprisingly functional—[[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] is methodical in his hatred
- **Corruption:** Not tolerated; everything serves the purpose

### Resources
- **Sources:** Diminished farming, forest products, fishing (the Bitter Coast)
- **The Problem:** Tribute payments consume most income; the land is becoming less productive
- **The Secret:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has stopped paying tribute for six months—no one has noticed yet
- **Dark Resources:** Something in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] provides... power, if not wealth

### Justice
- **System:** Lord's judgment; [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] handles everything personally
- **Notable Feature:** Extremely harsh on disloyalty; lenient on everything else
- **The Transformation:** Criminals are now given the choice: death, or service in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]
- **What That Means:** No one who serves in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] remains... unchanged

### Armed Forces
- **Official Army:** Perhaps 2,000 soldiers—enough for defense, not conquest
- **The Reality:** Something else is growing in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]
- **Veterans:** Many survivors of [[The Great War|the Great War]]; they remember what was done to them
- **The Changed:** Those who serve near [[The Ashen Fields|Pepelishte]] develop... abilities

## Politics

### Internal Factions

3. **The Broken:** Those too beaten to resist, who serve because there is no alternative
4. **The Watchers:** Those who observe [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] and have begun to change

### Current Issues
1. **The Tribute:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has secretly stopped paying; eventually someone will notice
2. **The Curse:** The dead are rising faster; the corruption is spreading
3. **The Bargain:** Whatever power [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has contacted wants something in return
4. **[[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]]:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s son is twelve—old enough to notice his father is changing

### External Relations

| [[House Valdren]] | Hatred (hidden) | They funded the armies that burned Karath lands |
| [[House Thorne]] | Hatred (hidden) | They occupy former Karath territory |

## History

### Origins
House Karath is among the oldest families in Eldermyr, ruling the southern regions since before unification. They were proud, powerful, and when [[The Mad King|the Mad King]] rose, they saw in him a strong ruler who would restore proper order. They were wrong—or were they?

### [[The Great War]]
- **Position:** Loyal to [[The Mad King|the Mad King]] until the end
- **Belief:** The King was not mad—he was right about what was coming
- **[[The Eastern March|The March]] of Ash:** [[The Mad King]]'s final campaign burned through Karath lands
- **Ashen Fields:** [[The Battle of Ashen Fields|The final battle]] was fought here; 30,000 died in a single day
- **The Aftermath:** Stripped of lands, forced to pay tribute, made examples of

### The Long Humiliation
For twenty-three years, House Karath has endured:
- Tribute payments that beggar them
- Thorne occupation of ancestral lands
- Crown supervision of their remaining territory
- The pity of houses that were once their equals

### The Turning
Five years ago, [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] began visiting [[The Ashen Fields]] alone. He prayed to the gods for justice. Something answered—something that was not [[The Faith of the Three]].

### Current Situation
The dead are rising in [[The Ashen Fields|Pepelishte]]—not as mindless undead but as soldiers, still fighting the war that killed them. Most of the realm sees this as a curse to be contained. [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] sees it as an army waiting to be commanded. He has made contact with whatever power animates them. He has been promised vengeance. The price is not yet clear—but [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] is willing to pay anything.

## Secrets

1. **[[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has made a bargain with [[The Unnamed]].** The ancient thing beneath [[The Ashen Fields]]—[[Magic of Eldermyr]] that predates [[The Faith of the Three]]—has answered his prayers. It promises to restore his house, avenge his family, and remake the realm. The price is not fully revealed.

2. **The rising dead are not random.** [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] can influence which dead rise and how they behave. He is building an army in the mass graves. When war comes, he will have soldiers who cannot die.

3. **[[The Mad King]] was right.** Aldric I genuinely saw what was coming—something ancient stirring beneath the realm. His methods were monstrous, but his warnings were true. [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has access to his father's records confirming this.

4. **The curse is spreading faster than anyone admits.** The corruption from [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] is contaminating groundwater, crops, and people. Karath peasants are changing—becoming more violent, less afraid of death, hearing whispers.

5. **[[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] is further gone than [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] knows.** She has given more to [[The Unnamed]] than she has told her brother. She may no longer be entirely [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]]—something else may be looking through her eyes.

## Plot Hooks

3. **Into [[The Ashen Fields]]:** Someone needs to investigate [[The Ashen Fields]]—what they find there will determine the realm's fate. But the Fields do not easily release those who enter.

4. **[[The Mad King]]'s Legacy:** [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has documents proving Aldric I's warnings were true. The party discovers this—do they reveal it? Does it matter if [[The Mad King|the Mad King]] was right?

5. **The Sister's Secret:** [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] approaches the party secretly, claiming she wants to stop her brother. Is she sincere, or is this another layer of deception?

### Seat of Power
**Prompt:**
> The throne hall of Chernogrod, the Black City of House Karath. A once-grand chamber now shrouded in shadow, many torches unlit. Lord Draven Karath sits in a throne of dark wood and iron, dressed in black, his gaunt face half-illuminated by firelight. Behind him hangs the banner of the black tree with silver roots. The hall is nearly empty—only guards and shadows attend. The atmosphere is one of decay, defiance, and something darker waiting. Cracks in the walls, dust on the floor, but the throne is maintained.

### The Ashen Fields
**Prompt:**
> The Ashen Fields (Pepelishte) at twilight—a vast expanse of dead gray earth stretching to the horizon. Rusted weapons and armor fragments protrude from the soil. In the distance, a figure that might be a man wearing a crown of blackened iron walks among the graves. Mist rises from the ground like breath. Here and there, hands seem to reach up through the earth. The sky is blood-red at the horizon, fading to corpse-gray above. The atmosphere is one of mass death, corruption, and terrible patience.

The walls around it are cracked, the altar abandoned—but this banner remains.

- The question: Is vengeance worth becoming a monster?
