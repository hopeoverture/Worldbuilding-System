# House Thorne

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> House Thorne represents martial power, sacrifice, and bitter pride. They have guarded the realm's eastern border for five centuries and believe the crown should be theirs by right of blood spent. They should feel cold, disciplined, and dangerous in a completely different way than [[House Valdren|the Valdrens]]. Germanic/Anglo-Saxon naming conventions apply.

## Overview
House Thorne has held [[The Eastern March]] for five hundred years, sacrificing generation after generation to guard the realm against foreign invasion. They are soldiers, forged in the cold highlands and tempered by constant vigilance. When [[The Mad King]] rose, they fought. When the rebellion began, they bled. They lost more than any other house in [[The Great War]]—including [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]]'s husband and eldest son at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. For twenty-three years, she has watched [[House Valdren]] reap rewards for writing checks while her family paid in corpses. Now, with the throne empty, [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] believes the time has come to claim what sacrifice has earned.

## History

### Origins
Five hundred years ago, when the unified realm needed a dedicated defense against foreign powers, the Thornes were granted [[The Eastern March|the Eastern March]]. They were minor nobles known only for military prowess. The grant came with a condition: hold the border forever. They have, at terrible cost.

### The Eastern War (300 years ago)
A massive foreign invasion tested [[The Eastern March|the March]]. The Thornes held for three years against overwhelming odds, losing half their family before relief arrived. This cemented their reputation—and their resentment that the rest of the realm lives soft while Thornes die.

### [[The Great War]]
- **Initial Position:** Many Thornes initially supported [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s strong rule
- **The Turning:** When his madness became undeniable, [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] convinced her husband to switch sides
- **The Siege of [[Stahlburg]]:** They held for eight months against loyalist forces before breaking out
- **Ashen Fields:** Lord Eckhart and Ser Roland died in [[The Battle of Ashen Fields|the final battle]]
- **Aftermath:** [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] expected gratitude; instead, [[House Valdren|the Valdrens]] took the regency

### Current Situation
For twenty-three years, [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] has nursed her grievances while building her strength. Now [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] is dead, a boy claims the throne, and a merchant lord holds the regency. She is dying—she has perhaps a year—and she will not die watching Valdrens rule what her family earned in blood. War is coming; she means to win it.

**Personality:** Cold, patient, absolutely certain of her cause. Loved her husband and son; their deaths made her merciless. Cannot imagine compromise.
**Secret:** She is dying from a wasting illness. She has perhaps a year. Her urgency is personal—she wants to die knowing her sacrifices meant something.

### [[Ser Aldric Thorne]]
**Age:** 38
**Title:** Sword of [[The Eastern March|the March]], Heir
**Appearance:** His father's image—tall, dark-haired, powerfully built. Battle scars visible on his hands and face.
**Personality:** A soldier's soldier; inspires loyalty; believes in his mother's cause but lacks her subtlety.
**Role:** Military commander; would lead armies while [[Lady Margret Thorne|Margret]] leads strategy.

### [[Ser Konrad Thorne]]
**Age:** 35

**Appearance:** Shorter than his brothers, broader; hands permanently stained from forge-work despite his rank.
**Personality:** Patient, methodical, sees [[The Eastern March|the March]]'s strength in iron rather than glory.

## Secrets

1. **[[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] is dying.** A wasting illness gives her perhaps a year. Her sons don't know. Her desperation drives everything—she will risk civil war rather than die with the throne ungrasped.

2. **Something came through the Pass during [[The Great War|the Great War]].** In the chaos, something crossed from foreign lands. The Thornes have been hunting it for twenty years without success—and don't know what it is.

3. **The foreign power is massing.** Scout reports show unprecedented military buildup beyond the mountains. The realm needs Thorne strength, but no one in [[Aldersgate]] is listening.

4. **[[Ser Viktor Thorne|Ser Viktor]] has betrayed his family.** Believing his mother will doom the realm, he has secretly negotiated with foreign powers. His "non-aggression pact" may cost more than anyone realizes.

3. **Beyond the Pass:** A foreign dignitary crosses into Eldermyr with an urgent warning—and is immediately arrested by [[Ser Viktor Thorne|Viktor]]. Something is wrong at the border.

4. **The Forge of Legends:** [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] claims she can craft a weapon that will unite the realm—but she needs materials from beyond the Ostmark Pass. Who will dare retrieve them?

5. **The Brothers' War:** Aldric and [[Ser Viktor Thorne|Viktor]]'s disagreements grow dangerous. The party finds themselves between brothers on the brink of violence.

### Seat of Power (The Iron Throne Hall)
**Prompt:**
The great hall of Stahlburg, carved from the living granite of the mountain itself, where House Thorne has dispensed justice and waged war for five hundred years. The walls are raw stone with minimal decoration—this is not a palace but a war council chamber made permanent. Massive iron chandeliers hang from a vaulted ceiling lost in shadows, their flames casting dancing light across ancient battle standards that line the walls—trophies from five centuries of border defense, enemies defeated, invasions repelled. Lady Margret Thorne sits upon a throne of dark iron that seems grown from the stone floor, her gaunt frame in black and silver armor, one hand on the pommel of her sword, steel-gray eyes surveying her war council. Flanking her stand her three sons: Ser Aldric in the armor of the Sword of the March, Ser Konrad with forge-stained hands despite his noble rank, and Ser Viktor with the watchful eyes of a man who guards the border against foreign powers. Before them, the Iron Council sits at a massive stone table covered with maps and tactical tokens. Guards in full plate stand at attention along the walls, their armor bearing the silver thorn crown sigil. The braziers burn hot but the hall remains cold—whether from the mountain or the Thorne temperament, none can say. The atmosphere is of disciplined menace, of a family that measures worth in blood spilled defending the realm and expects the same from all who serve them.

### The House Thorne Banner at War
**Prompt:**
The war banner of House Thorne displayed at the head of a marching army on the Eastern March, the realm's most feared military force in motion. The banner is massive—ten feet tall, carried by a standard-bearer in full plate on a warhorse—black wool with the house sigil worked in silver thread: a thorned crown above crossed swords. No gold adorns it, no softness, no decoration beyond the stark heraldry of a house that measures worth in sacrifice. The motto "We Endure" is embroidered below in silver on blood-red field. Behind the banner, the March army moves in disciplined formation: heavy cavalry in black-and-red armor, infantry bearing pikes and halberds, supply wagons bearing the arms that Hammerhall forges. The landscape is the highland moor of the Eastern March—wind-swept, harsh, the kind of land that breeds hard people. Storm clouds gather overhead but the army marches on. The atmosphere of implacable military force, of a house that has spent five hundred years defending the realm and now believes it is owed a crown for its sacrifices.

### The Hall of the Fallen
**Prompt:**
Deep within Stahlburg, the Hall of the Fallen—House Thorne's memorial to every member of the family who has died defending the realm. A long corridor carved into the mountain, lit by eternal flames that have burned for centuries. The walls are lined with recesses, each containing the armor of a fallen Thorne: hundreds of suits arranged chronologically, from ancient chainmail near the entrance to the fresh plate of Lord Eckhart and Ser Roland at the far end, killed at the Battle of Ashen Fields twenty-three years ago. Beneath each armor stands a stone plaque with the fallen's name, titles, and manner of death. Fresh flowers lie before Eckhart and Roland's memorials—Lady Margret still visits every week. The corridor seems to go on forever, the weight of generations of sacrifice pressing down. The armor glints in firelight, each suit a life given so the realm could endure. At the corridor's end, two empty recesses wait: Lady Margret's and whoever dies next. The atmosphere of ancestral duty, of a debt paid in blood that the Thornes believe the realm has never acknowledged.

- Thornes are cold, disciplined, and proud of their suffering
- Military culture pervades everything—even religion serves the state
- Lady Margret's illness creates desperate urgency
