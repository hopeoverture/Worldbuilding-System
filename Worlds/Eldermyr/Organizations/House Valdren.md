# House Valdren

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> House Valdren represents [[Magic of Eldermyr|the power]] of wealth over steel—a merchant dynasty that has risen to effective control of the realm through gold, marriages, and patient scheming. They should feel refined, cultured, and subtly dangerous. Romance/Mediterranean naming conventions apply.

## Overview
House Valdren rules [[The Western Shore|the Western Shore]] from their gleaming port city of [[Porto Valdris]], commanding more wealth than any other house in Eldermyr. For two centuries they have climbed through commerce rather than conquest, marrying into royal lines while their rivals bled on battlefields. Now, with [[Lord Varic Valdren|Lord Varic]] serving as regent for his grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]—the boy claimant to the throne—the Valdrens stand closer to absolute power than ever before. But their wealth is built on debt, their alliances on convenience, and their claim to the regency is contested by houses with longer swords.

## History

### Origins
The Valdrens were minor traders when the realm unified. They built their fortune through shrewd investments in shipping during the Age of Kings, gradually marrying into higher nobility. Two centuries ago, Lord Aldric Valdren (the "Merchant Prince") married his daughter to a royal prince, beginning their climb toward the throne itself.

### Rise to Power
- **200 years ago:** [[Lord Varic Valdren|The Merchant Prince]] marriage
- **150 years ago:** Secured the Golden Strait monopoly
- **100 years ago:** Became the realm's bankers
- **50 years ago:** [[Lord Varic Valdren|Lord Varic]]'s father arranged his future daughter-in-law's marriage to the king's heir

### [[The Great War]]
House Valdren funded the rebellion against [[The Mad King|the Mad King]] while keeping their sons out of major battles. They provided gold, ships, and supplies. When victory came, they arranged for a Valdren daughter to marry Prince Aldric (later [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]). Twenty years later, that marriage produced [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]—the boy who would be king.

### Current Situation
[[Lord Varic Valdren|Lord Varic]] has achieved what his ancestors dreamed: a Valdren on the throne (almost). As regent, he effectively rules the realm. But [[Lady Margret Thorne]] challenges his authority. His grandson shows disturbing independence. And the house's debts grow heavier. [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] may have grasped too far—and the fall could be spectacular.

## Key Figures

### [[Lord Varic Valdren]]
**Age:** 62
**Title:** Lord of [[The Western Shore|the Western Shore]], Lord Regent
**Appearance:** Silver-haired, sharp-featured, elegantly dressed. Moves slowly due to age but misses nothing. Always wears [[Lord Varic Valdren|the regent]]'s chain of office.
**Personality:** Patient, calculating, genuinely loves his family in his cold way. Believes he knows what's best for everyone. Cannot imagine losing.
**Secret:** He suspects someone in his own house poisoned [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] to accelerate the plan—and he's afraid to find out who.

### Lady Serana Valdren
**Age:** 58
**Title:** Lady of [[Porto Valdris]]
**Role:** The social power behind the house—she knows everyone's secrets and manages the complex web of alliances through charm and careful cultivation.
**Secret:** She knows about the debts. She's been quietly selling off minor holdings to buy time.

### [[Edric Valdren]]
**Age:** 15
**Title:** Heir Apparent to the Throne of Eldermyr
**Appearance:** Looks like his dead mother—Valdren features but with his father's (the prince's) eyes.
**Personality:** Intelligent, observant, angry. He knows his grandfather sees him as a puppet.
**Secret:** He's been corresponding with [[Lady Margret Thorne]], exploring whether [[House Thorne]] might support him against his own family.

## Secrets

1. **The Valdrens poisoned [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]].** Not [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] himself—he's too cautious—but someone in the family arranged it. The timing was too convenient. [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] suspects but doesn't want to know the truth.

2. **House Valdren's wealth is built on debt.** They owe foreign powers across the Trader's Sea more than they can ever repay without the crown's taxing authority. The regency isn't ambition—it's survival.

3. **[[Edric Valdren|Edric]] isn't the puppet they think he is.** The boy has been reaching out to rival houses, including [[House Thorne|the Thornes]]. He may try to destroy his own family to be free of them.

4. **The Sunken Palace holds pre-Faith secrets.** The underwater ruins near [[Porto Valdris]] contain evidence that gods existed before [[The Faith of the Three]]. House Valdren has been quietly suppressing this for generations at [[The Faith of the Three]]'s request—for a price.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Merchant's Gambit:** A rival trading house has evidence of Valdren debts. The party is hired to recover—or destroy—the documents.

2. **[[Edric Valdren|The Boy King]]'s Letters:** Someone needs to intercept [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]'s correspondence with Lady Thorne. Or protect it. The party must choose sides.

3. **The Sunken Secret:** A dying scholar reveals the location of the Sunken Palace's entrance. What they find could shake [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]—and Valdren power.

4. **The Pirate King:** Someone is organizing coastal pirates into a fleet aimed at [[Porto Valdris]]. Is this [[House Thorne]]'s work, foreign powers, or something worse?

5. **The Reckoning:** The annual audit reveals a devastating shortfall. Someone must travel to foreign courts to negotiate new terms—or face the consequences.
