# The Forgemasters Guild

## Overview
The Forgemasters Guild controls the production of weapons and armor throughout [[The Eastern March|the Eastern March]]—and by extension, much of the realm. Based in [[Hammerhall]], they transform the iron ore of the Ostmark Range into the finest steel in Eldermyr. Every house depends on Forgemaster work for their armies. In the current crisis, whoever controls the forges controls the means of war.

## Classification

**Type:** Craft Guild (Smithing and Metallurgy)

**Status:** Officially sanctioned by [[House Thorne]]; practically independent

## Structure

### Leadership
**Guildmaster:** [[Grimhild the Smith]]—legendary forgemaster, said to craft weapons that never break. An elderly woman with arms like iron and eyes that judge every blade.

**Council:** Seven Master Smiths from major forge-towns

### Ranks
| Rank | Count | Responsibilities |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Guildmaster | 1 | Overall direction, major commissions |
| Master Smith | ~50 | Own forges, train apprentices |
| Journeyman | ~500 | Skilled workers, may travel |
| Apprentice | ~1,400 | Learning the craft |

## Operations

### Primary Products
- Weapons (swords, axes, polearms)
- Armor (plate, chain, scale)
- Tools (agricultural, mining, construction)
- Specialty items (locks, mechanisms)

### Major Locations
- **[[Hammerhall]]:** The guild's heart, greatest concentration of forges
- **[[Stahlburg]] forges:** Producing for [[House Thorne]] directly
- **Eisendorf:** Near the richest ore deposits
- **Licensed smiths:** Throughout the realm (pay guild dues)

### Trade
- Officially supplies [[House Thorne]] first
- Sells to other houses at premium prices
- Technically neutral in the succession crisis
- Practically essential to whoever wants to wage war

## Politics

### Relationship with [[House Thorne]]
- Officially under Thorne authority
- Practically too valuable to coerce
- [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] deals directly with [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]]
- [[Ser Konrad Thorne]] (Master of Iron) coordinates

### Current Position
The guild has not declared for any faction. [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] maintains they serve whoever pays—but she is loyal to [[The Eastern March|the March]]. If [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] calls, the forges will answer.

### Secrets
1. **[[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] has a private commission.** She claims she can forge a weapon that will unite the realm—but she needs materials from beyond the Ostmark Pass.

2. **The guild has ancient techniques.** Secrets passed down from before the realm unified. Some border on magic; [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] doesn't know.

3. **War is profitable.** The succession crisis is good for business. Some in the guild quietly hope it continues.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Secret Commission:** [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] needs rare materials. The party could retrieve them—or discover what she's really making.

2. **The Arms Race:** Multiple houses bid for exclusive guild contracts. The party might negotiate—or sabotage.

3. **The Ancient Technique:** A forgotten forging method could create weapons effective against the rising dead. Finding the old texts requires delving into dangerous ruins.

### The Forges of Hammerhall
**Prompt:**
> The great forge hall at Hammerhall, heart of the Forgemasters Guild and the realm's weapon production. A massive stone hall built into the mountainside, its ceiling lost in smoke and heat shimmer. Dozens of forges line the walls, each tended by master smiths and their apprentices, the ring of hammer on anvil creating a constant rhythm. Waterwheels visible through high windows power trip hammers and bellows. Grimhild the Smith works at the central forge—the largest and oldest—her powerful arms swinging a hammer despite her advanced age, sparks cascading from white-hot steel. Journeymen carry finished blades to quenching troughs while apprentices pump bellows and stack ingots. Racks of completed weapons line one wall: swords, axes, polearms, each bearing the Forgemaster mark. The heat is visible in the air, sweat glistening on bare arms and leather-aproned chests. Iron chandeliers hold candles for the detailed work, but most light comes from the forges themselves—orange and white in the dim hall. The atmosphere of honest labor, ancient craft, and the power that comes from arming armies.

### Grimhild's Masterwork
**Prompt:**
> Grimhild the Smith presenting a completed commission to a Thorne knight in her private forge at Grimhold. The legendary forgemaster stands beside her anvil, holding up a longsword that catches the firelight—the blade shows the distinctive wave pattern of her folded steel, the edge so keen it seems to cut the light itself. Grimhild is elderly but unbowed, her arms corded with muscle, her face weathered but proud, silver hair bound back from the heat. Her leather apron bears burns from fifty years at the forge. The knight examines the blade with reverence, knowing he holds a weapon that will outlast him by centuries. The private forge is smaller than the guild halls but more personal: tools arranged with care, failed experiments in a barrel, a shrine to the Smith aspect of the Three above the door. On the wall, examples of her greatest works: blades commissioned by three generations of House Thorne. Through the window, the waterwheels of the Stahlfluss turn endlessly. The atmosphere of craft perfected over a lifetime, of weapons that become legends.
