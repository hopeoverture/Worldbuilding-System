# The Forgemasters Guild

## Overview
The Forgemasters Guild controls the production of weapons and armor throughout the Eastern March—and by extension, much of the realm. Based in Hammerhall, they transform the iron ore of the Ostmark Range into the finest steel in Eldermyr. Every house depends on Forgemaster work for their armies. In the current crisis, whoever controls the forges controls the means of war.

## Classification

**Type:** Craft Guild (Smithing and Metallurgy)

**Status:** Officially sanctioned by House Thorne; practically independent

## Structure

### Leadership
**Guildmaster:** [[Grimhild the Smith]]—legendary forgemaster, said to craft weapons that never break. An elderly woman with arms like iron and eyes that judge every blade.

**Council:** Seven Master Smiths from major forge-towns

### Ranks
| Rank | Count | Responsibilities |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Guildmaster | 1 | Overall direction, major commissions |
| Master Smith | ~50 | Own forges, train apprentices |
| Journeyman | ~500 | Skilled workers, may travel |
| Apprentice | ~1,400 | Learning the craft |

## Operations

### Primary Products
- Weapons (swords, axes, polearms)
- Armor (plate, chain, scale)
- Tools (agricultural, mining, construction)
- Specialty items (locks, mechanisms)

### Major Locations
- **Hammerhall:** The guild's heart, greatest concentration of forges
- **Stahlburg forges:** Producing for House Thorne directly
- **Eisendorf:** Near the richest ore deposits
- **Licensed smiths:** Throughout the realm (pay guild dues)

### Trade
- Officially supplies House Thorne first
- Sells to other houses at premium prices
- Technically neutral in the succession crisis
- Practically essential to whoever wants to wage war

## Politics

### Relationship with House Thorne
- Officially under Thorne authority
- Practically too valuable to coerce
- Grimhild deals directly with Lady Margret
- Ser Konrad Thorne (Master of Iron) coordinates

### Current Position
The guild has not declared for any faction. Grimhild maintains they serve whoever pays—but she is loyal to the March. If Lady Margret calls, the forges will answer.

### Secrets
1. **Grimhild has a private commission.** She claims she can forge a weapon that will unite the realm—but she needs materials from beyond the Ostmark Pass.

2. **The guild has ancient techniques.** Secrets passed down from before the realm unified. Some border on magic; the Faith doesn't know.

3. **War is profitable.** The succession crisis is good for business. Some in the guild quietly hope it continues.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Secret Commission:** Grimhild needs rare materials. The party could retrieve them—or discover what she's really making.

2. **The Arms Race:** Multiple houses bid for exclusive guild contracts. The party might negotiate—or sabotage.

3. **The Ancient Technique:** A forgotten forging method could create weapons effective against the rising dead. Finding the old texts requires delving into dangerous ruins.
