# The Grey Wardens

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The Grey Wardens are an ancient order devoted to the Chronicler—the aspect of [[The Faith of the Three]] who governs death and the final rest. They investigate disturbances of the dead and combat necromancy. With the rising dead in [[The Ashen Fields]], their small order suddenly faces a crisis that could determine the realm's fate. They should feel grim, devoted, and stretched too thin.

## Overview
The Grey Wardens are the Chronicler's sword—an ancient order of warrior-priests devoted to ensuring the dead find their final rest. For centuries they have hunted necromancers, laid restless spirits to peace, and investigated disturbances in the great quiet. They are few; their work is difficult and largely thankless. But now, with the dead rising in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] and the corruption spreading, the Grey Wardens find themselves at the center of the realm's greatest crisis. Their Grandmaster believes this is what the order was created for. He also knows they are vastly outnumbered by what they must fight.

## Classification

### Type
**Organization Type:** Religious Military Order (under [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith of the Three]])

**Focus:** Combating undead, hunting necromancers, investigating disturbances of the dead

### Status
**Recognition:** Sanctioned by [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]], chartered by the Crown

**Prestige:** Respected but overlooked—until recently

**Current State:** Overwhelmed by [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] crisis

## Purpose

### Mission
To serve the Chronicler by ensuring all souls reach their final rest. This means:
- Hunting necromancers and practitioners of forbidden death magic
- Investigating reports of restless dead
- Performing rites to lay spirits to peace
- Maintaining the integrity of graveyards and burial grounds
- Advising secular and religious authorities on matters of the dead

### Authority
The Grey Wardens have legal authority to:
- Investigate any disturbance involving the dead
- Enter any burial ground or cemetery
- Question any person regarding necromancy
- Request assistance from secular authorities
- In extremis, execute confirmed necromancers without trial

This authority is contested in practice—noble houses resent Warden interference, and the current succession crisis means no clear authority backs their mandate.

## Doctrine

### The Chronicler's Creed
The Grey Wardens believe:
- Every soul is sacred and deserves rest
- Death is not an ending but a passage to the Chronicler's Halls
- Necromancy is the greatest violation—stealing souls from their rightful place
- The dead who walk are victims, not monsters; they must be freed
- It is better to die than to become what they fight

### Practices
- **The Vigil:** Wardens stand watch over the newly dead until properly buried
- **The Quieting:** Rites to lay restless spirits to peace
- **The Burning:** Cremation of corrupted remains to prevent rising
- **The Hunt:** Active pursuit of necromancers and their servants
- **The Watch:** Monitoring burial grounds for disturbances

### Restrictions
Wardens are forbidden from:
- Using necromancy, even to combat it
- Trafficking with demons or dark spirits
- Extending life through unnatural means
- Taking life without absolute necessity
- Abandoning a fallen comrade's body to desecration

## Structure

### Leadership
**Grandmaster:** [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]]
**Title:** Grandmaster of the Grey, [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane|First Watcher]] of the Chronicler

**Description:** A grizzled man in his fifties, gray-haired (hence his name), scarred from decades of fighting the dead. Walks with a limp from a wound that never fully healed—a necromancer's curse, they say. Eyes that have seen too much but still burn with conviction.

**Philosophy:** [[The Ashen Fields]] are the great test. The order will rise to it or die trying. There is no third option.

- Undead types and how to combat them
- Historical incidents and their resolutions
- [[The Ashen Fields]] (growing daily)

## Current Crisis

### [[The Ashen Fields]]
The rising dead in [[The Ashen Fields|Pepelishte]] represent the greatest threat the order has faced:
- **Scale:** Thousands of dead, possibly more
- **Nature:** Not mindless—they fight with purpose
- **Source:** Unknown (the Wardens suspect necromancy but something more)
- **Spread:** The corruption is expanding
- **[[The Mad King|The Figure]]:** Reports of something wearing a crown of black iron

### Warden Response
- 60 Wardens assigned to [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] (under Mira Duskwell)
- Establishing a forward base at the edge of the corruption
- Attempting to identify the source and nature of the rising
- Suffering casualties—12 Wardens lost in the past three months
- Requesting reinforcements that don't exist

### The Problem
The Wardens are designed to hunt individual necromancers and deal with isolated incidents. [[The Ashen Fields]] represent an army. They need:
- More personnel (recruiting heavily but training takes time)
- More resources ([[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] is stretched thin)
- Political support (the succession crisis distracts everyone)
- Information (no one knows what they're truly facing)

## Politics

### Within [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]
- **The Synod** supports the Wardens but has limited resources
- **[[High Confessor Maren]]** sees the rising dead as divine judgment; his support is uncertain
- **Some bishops** believe the Wardens' aggressive investigation threatens political relationships

### With Secular Powers
- **The Crown** (regency) has not fully acknowledged the threat
- **[[House Valdren]]** views the crisis as a Karath problem, not theirs
- **[[House Thorne]]** might ally with the Wardens if it suited their interests
- **[[House Karath]]** officially denies any involvement; the Wardens are suspicious

### Internal
- **Hardliners** want to march into [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] in force, regardless of cost
- **Cautious voices** argue for more information before committing
- **The desperate** consider whether forbidden knowledge might be needed to fight forbidden power

## Key Figures

### [[Ser Aldric Thorne|Ser Aldric]] [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane|Greymane]]
**Age:** 54
**Title:** Grandmaster of the Grey
**Appearance:** Weathered, gray-haired, scarred. Moves with purpose despite his limp. Wears the traditional gray over practical armor. His eyes are the color of steel—and just as hard.
**Personality:** Grimly determined. Has buried more friends than he can count. Believes the order's purpose is finally clear.
**Secret:** He has read forbidden texts to understand what he fights. He worries the corruption is already in him.

### Warden-Commander Mira Duskwell
**Age:** 38
**Title:** Commander of the Forward Post
**Appearance:** Dark-skinned, shaven-headed, ritual scars on her forearms (tradition from her homeland). Built for endurance rather than strength.
**Personality:** Pragmatic, unflinching, beloved by those under her command.
**Role:** Leads the effort at [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]. Has seen things she cannot adequately describe.
**Secret:** She has captured a speaking dead—one that remembers being alive. Its words haunt her.

### Warden-Commander Helena Ashbrook
**Age:** 45
**Title:** Commander of the [[Aldersgate]] Post
**Appearance:** Aristocratic bearing, silver-streaked dark hair, missing two fingers on her left hand.
**Personality:** Political, careful, effective at navigating secular power.
**Role:** The order's voice in [[Aldersgate|the capital]]; navigating the succession crisis.
**Secret:** She has been approached by agents of [[House Valdren]] offering resources—for a price.

### Brother Corvus
**Age:** Unknown (appears elderly)
**Title:** Keeper of the Archives
**Appearance:** Hunched, paper-thin skin, remarkably sharp eyes. Always surrounded by books and scrolls.
**Personality:** Brilliant, obsessive, possibly mad.
**Role:** Knows more about necromancy than anyone living (he claims).
**Secret:** He has been to [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] in dreams. Something there knows him.

## Secrets

1. **The Wardens have forbidden texts.** Like [[The Arcane Academy]], they maintain archives of necromantic lore—for understanding their enemy. If [[The Faith of the Three]] knew the extent, there would be consequences.

2. **Grandmaster [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]] is partially cursed.** The wound that gave him his limp was inflicted by a necromancer who spoke a word that has never fully faded. [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]] ages faster than he should; he may have only years left.

3. **Commander Duskwell captured a speaking dead.** One of the risen at [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] retained its memories and spoke to her. It said it was commanded by someone wearing a crown—and that it was grateful to be free when she destroyed it.

4. **Brother Corvus has communicated with something in the Fields.** In his dreams, something has offered him knowledge in exchange for... something. He has not refused. He has not agreed. He has kept listening.

5. **The Wardens know [[House Karath]] is involved.** They have evidence that [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] has visited [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] repeatedly. They lack the political power to act on this knowledge.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Warden's Call:** The order is desperately recruiting. The party is offered membership—or at least a contract for specific services.

2. **The Forward Post:** Warden-Commander Duskwell needs reinforcements or information. The party is sent to the edge of [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]].

3. **The Speaking Dead:** The party encounters a risen dead that talks—begs for release—and reveals information about what commands it.

4. **The Archive Break-In:** Someone is stealing from the Warden archives. The thief knows exactly what they want. The party must find them before the knowledge spreads.

5. **[[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]]'s Confession:** [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]] approaches the party privately. He is dying. He needs someone to complete a mission he cannot—one that might save the order, or damn it.
