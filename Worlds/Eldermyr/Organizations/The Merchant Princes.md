# The Merchant Princes

## Overview

The Merchant Princes are the wealthy trading families who control commerce in [[The Western Shore]], particularly the vital port of [[Porto Valdris]]. Though [[House Valdren]] rules the region politically, the Princes command its economic lifeblood—ships, warehouses, trade contracts, and the gold that makes everything move.

The title "Prince" is traditional rather than noble; these families hold no formal aristocratic rank. But in [[The Western Shore]], gold speaks louder than titles, and the wealthiest merchants live in palaces that rival any lord's.

## Organization

### The Golden Council
The Merchant Princes govern their affairs through the Golden Council, which meets in Porto Valdris's Merchant Hall. Each of the thirty recognized houses holds one seat. Decisions require two-thirds majority, ensuring that no single faction can dominate.

### House Recognition
To be recognized as a Merchant Prince house, a family must:
- Control assets worth at least 50,000 gold pieces
- Have operated for at least three generations
- Receive sponsorship from an existing house
- Be approved by Council vote

### The First Among Equals
The Council elects a **Primo Mercante** to serve as speaker and tie-breaker. The current holder is **Marco Fortunato**, a shrewd negotiator who has balanced competing interests for fifteen years.

## Major Houses

| House | Specialty | Notable Figure |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| House Fortunato | Banking, loans | Marco Fortunato (Primo Mercante) |
| House Corsini | Shipbuilding | Marina Corsini |
| House Grimaldi | Wine export | Anton Grimaldi |
| House Sforza | Silk trade | Isabella Sforza |
| House Medrano | Spice import | Carlos Medrano |
| House Barbarigo | Insurance | Old Vincenzo Barbarigo |

## Economic Power

### Trade Control
The Merchant Princes collectively control approximately 80% of all goods flowing through [[Porto Valdris]]. Their ships dominate the Trader's Sea routes. Their warehouses store the region's wealth. Their contracts determine who can sell what.

### Banking
Several Prince houses operate as bankers, providing loans to everyone from farmers to foreign monarchs. [[House Valdren]] itself owes significant debts to Merchant Prince banks—a fact that complicates political relationships.

### Insurance
The Princes run mutual insurance pools that protect against shipwreck, piracy, and natural disaster. Merchants who refuse to join the system find themselves unable to secure cargo or credit.

## Relationship with House Valdren

The relationship between the Merchant Princes and [[House Valdren]] is one of mutual dependence and quiet tension. The Princes need Valdren's political protection and military power; Valdren needs the Princes' gold and trade expertise.

[[Lord Varic Valdren]]'s regency has complicated matters. His focus on [[Aldersgate]] has left the Princes with more autonomy—but also less protection. Piracy is increasing, and some Princes wonder if they should be making their own arrangements.

## Current Concerns

### The Pirate Problem
[[Stormbreak Keep]] has fallen to pirates under Captain Blacktide, threatening shipping lanes. The Princes are debating whether to petition [[House Valdren]] for naval action or fund their own mercenary response.

### The Debt Question
Several houses are overextended on loans to [[House Valdren]]. If the succession crisis destabilizes the realm, those debts might never be repaid. Some Princes are quietly calling in loans; others are doubling down on Valdren's eventual victory.

### Foreign Competition
Merchants from across the Trader's Sea are probing Eldermyr's markets, sensing opportunity in the political chaos. The Princes must balance protecting their monopolies against the benefits of new trade.

## Plot Hooks

1. **Pirate Response:** The Princes hire adventurers to deal with [[Stormbreak Keep]] since [[House Valdren]] won't act. The reward is substantial—but so are the pirates.

2. **Debt Collection:** A Prince house needs "specialists" to recover a debt from a noble who refuses to pay. Diplomacy preferred; other methods acceptable.

3. **Trade War:** Competition between houses has escalated to sabotage. The Princes need neutral investigators before someone gets killed.
