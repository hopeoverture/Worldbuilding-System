# The Raven Circle

## Overview

The Raven Circle is a secretive society of mages, scholars, and collectors dedicated to preserving magical knowledge that [[The Arcane Academy]] and [[The Faith of the Three]] have deemed too dangerous for study. They believe that knowledge itself is neutral—that banning the study of necromancy or demonology doesn't make those arts less dangerous, only less understood.

Operating in the shadows of Eldermyr's magical establishment, the Circle maintains hidden libraries, conducts forbidden experiments, and recruits promising individuals who chafe under the Academy's restrictions. Their symbol—a raven clutching a scroll—appears in subtle places: bookmarks, jewelry, and coded messages.

## Philosophy

### Knowledge Without Judgment
The Circle rejects the classification of magic as "sanctioned" or "forbidden." They argue that understanding dark magic is essential to combating it, and that artificial restrictions only weaken the realm's defenses.

### Preservation Over Power
Unlike cults that seek forbidden knowledge for personal power, the Circle focuses on preservation and understanding. They study necromancy to learn how to combat the rising dead, not to raise armies of their own.

### The Long View
The Circle believes that knowledge lost can never be recovered. They see themselves as guardians against a future where forgotten evils return and no one remembers how to fight them.

## Activities

### Hidden Libraries
The Circle maintains secret collections of banned texts, experimental notes, and recovered artifacts. These libraries move frequently to avoid discovery.

### Quiet Recruitment
Circle members identify promising individuals—usually Academy students frustrated by restrictions—and gradually introduce them to broader perspectives. Recruitment is slow and careful; one loose tongue could destroy the organization.

### Shadow Research
Circle mages conduct research that Academy rules forbid: communicating with spirits, studying cursed items, experimenting with life and death. Their findings are shared only within the Circle.

### Artifact Recovery
When dangerous magical items surface, the Circle often moves to acquire them before the Academy can destroy them. They believe understanding such items is preferable to ignorant destruction.

## Interest in Ravenspire Tower

[[Ravenspire Tower]] holds particular significance for the Circle. Magister Corvane was a secret member before his death, and his research into communicating with the dead aligned perfectly with Circle philosophy. His notes, still locked in the haunted tower, could advance the Circle's understanding significantly.

The Circle would pay well for Corvane's research—or for allies willing to retrieve it from his wraith-haunted halls.

## Relationship with Authorities

### The Arcane Academy
The Academy considers the Raven Circle a dangerous myth or, at most, a handful of misguided cranks. The Circle encourages this perception. Several Circle members hold Academy positions, feeding information and occasionally steering policy.

### The Faith of the Three
The Faith views the Circle (to the extent they believe it exists) as heretics trafficking in demonic knowledge. Discovery would mean execution for heresy.

### House Valdren
Rumors suggest [[House Valdren]] has employed Circle members for "special consultations." The Circle neither confirms nor denies this.

## Organization Structure

The Circle maintains deliberate opacity about its structure. What is known:
- **The Keeper** — A single leader who knows all members (identity unknown)
- **Archivists** — Those who maintain the hidden libraries
- **Seekers** — Field agents who recover artifacts and recruit
- **Associates** — Sympathizers who aren't full members

Members know only a handful of other members, limiting damage if one is captured.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Corvane Retrieval:** The Circle contacts adventurers about recovering Magister Corvane's research from [[Ravenspire Tower]]. They offer gold, information, or magical assistance in return.

2. **Forbidden Knowledge:** A Circle member offers to share what they know about the curse spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]]—but the price is helping them acquire a dangerous artifact.

3. **The Academy's Hunt:** [[The Arcane Academy]] is getting close to exposing Circle members. The Circle needs outside help to mislead the investigation or evacuate compromised members.
