# The Spirit-Speakers

## Overview
The Spirit-Speakers are practitioners of the Old Ways—the pre-Faith tradition of ancestor veneration and spirit communion that survives in [[The Northlands|the Northlands]]. They serve as intermediaries between the living and the dead, interpreting dreams, conducting rituals at sacred sites, and maintaining the connection between generations. [[The Faith of the Three]] tolerates them as folk tradition; the Northfolk rely on them for guidance. Now, with the dead rising in the south, the Spirit-Speakers face a crisis: the ancestors are disturbed, and something is wrong with death itself.

## Classification

**Type:** Informal Religious Tradition (not a formal organization)

**Status:** Tolerated by [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]; central to Northland culture

**Legal Position:** Not officially recognized; not actively persecuted

## The Old Ways

### Beliefs
- The dead do not truly leave; their spirits linger to guide the living
- Ancestors watch over their descendants and can be consulted
- The land has spirits that must be respected
- Death is a transition, not an ending
- The living and dead are bound by blood and memory

### Practices
- **Ancestor Communion:** Rituals to contact and consult dead relatives
- **Dream Interpretation:** The dead speak through dreams
- **Spirit Appeasement:** Offerings to land spirits at sacred sites
- **Death Rituals:** Proper burial and passage rites
- **Prophecy:** Some Spirit-Speakers receive visions

### Sacred Sites
- [[Stoneholm]] Lake — Where Spirit-Speakers gather annually
- [[Myrkvid]] (The Dark Wood) — Ancient and powerful
- The Standing Stones — Predating [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]
- Countless ancestor shrines throughout [[The Northlands|the Northlands]]

## Structure

### Leadership (Informal)
There is no formal hierarchy. Authority comes from reputation, wisdom, and demonstrated power.

**Most Respected:** Elder Yrsa the Wise, chief of Clan Myrk, Speaker for two generations

**Other Notable Speakers:**
- Raven-Eye (young, powerful, troubling visions)
- Old Thorvald (claims to speak with spirits of the land itself)
- The Silent One (never speaks aloud; communicates through dreams)

### Training
Spirit-Speaking is passed through:
- Family traditions (mother to daughter, grandmother to granddaughter)
- Apprenticeship to established Speakers
- Spontaneous awakening (recognized and guided by elders)
- Dream instruction from the ancestors themselves

### Gathering
Spirit-Speakers gather once yearly at Stoneholm Lake for:
- Comparing visions and interpretations
- Training young practitioners
- Major rituals requiring combined power
- Discussing matters affecting the Old Ways

## Relationship with [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]

### Official Position
[[The Faith of the Three]] views Spirit-Speaking as:
- Harmless folk superstition (best case)
- Dangerous error bordering on heresy (worst case)
- Tolerated as long as practitioners don't challenge doctrine

### Practical Coexistence
- Many Northfolk observe both traditions
- Spirit-Speakers defer to [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] in public
- [[The Faith of the Three]] rarely enforces doctrine in the deep [[The Northlands]]
- Tensions exist but rarely escalate

### The Theological Problem
The rising dead in [[The Ashen Fields]] challenges both traditions. [[The Faith of the Three]] says the Chronicler guides souls to rest; the Old Ways say ancestors linger to guide the living. Neither explains dead who rise to fight old battles.

## Current Crisis

### The Ancestors Are Disturbed
Spirit-Speakers throughout [[The Northlands|the Northlands]] report:
- Ancestors appearing agitated in communion rituals
- Dreams filled with warnings and fear
- Land spirits withdrawing from sacred sites
- Something wrong with the passage of the dead

### Elder Yrsa's Secret
Elder Yrsa has been in communion with ancestors who witnessed [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. They have told her what lies beneath the mass graves—and it is older than [[The Faith of the Three]], older than the Old Ways, older than memory. She believes the south must suffer for abandoning the ancestors. She has not shared this knowledge.

### The Choice
Some Spirit-Speakers want to warn the south, despite everything. Others agree with Yrsa—let the faithless reap what they've sown. The dead will decide.

## Secrets

1. **Elder Yrsa knows what [[The Unnamed]] is.** The ancestors have told her about [[The Unnamed]] [[The Ashen Fields]]. It was here before humans. It was bound long ago. It is waking.

2. **Spirit-Speaking works differently now.** Since the rising began, communion with the dead has become easier—too easy. Some fear the boundary between living and dead is thinning everywhere.

3. **The Old Ways are growing stronger.** As [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]] weakens, the old spirits are becoming more active. Something is waking in Myrkvid that even the Spirit-Speakers cannot control.

4. **A Spirit-Speaker visited [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]].** Raven-Eye traveled south in secret and attempted to commune with the risen dead. What she learned broke something in her. She speaks only in riddles now.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Elder's Warning:** Elder Yrsa agrees to share what she knows—but only if the party proves worthy by completing a task in Myrkvid.

2. **The Silent Speaker:** The Silent One has been sending dreams to someone in the party. She has a message—but delivering it requires entering her dreams.

3. **Raven-Eye's Riddles:** The young Spirit-Speaker who visited [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] speaks truths hidden in madness. Can the party decode her warnings?

4. **The Gathering Interrupted:** Something attacks the annual gathering at Stoneholm. The Spirit-Speakers need protection—and answers.

### The Gathering at Stoneholm
**Prompt:**
> The annual gathering of Spirit-Speakers at Stoneholm Lake in the Northlands, where practitioners of the Old Ways convene beneath the midnight sun. A circle of weathered men and women in fur-lined robes stand around a still lake that reflects the eternal twilight sky. Elder Yrsa the Wise leads the ritual, her arms raised, pale smoke rising from offerings of bone and herb laid on ancient stones. The Standing Stones ring the lake—massive megaliths predating the Faith, carved with spiraling symbols that seem to shift in the flickering firelight. Younger apprentices watch from the outer circle, learning the rites that connect the living to the dead. A shimmering presence hovers above the lake's surface—ancestors answering the call, their forms translucent and watchful. Pine forests surround the sacred site, and the aurora dances green and purple overhead. The atmosphere of ancient power, unbroken tradition, and communion between worlds.

### Raven-Eye's Vision
**Prompt:**
> The young Spirit-Speaker known as Raven-Eye in the aftermath of her journey to the Ashen Fields, sitting alone in a darkened hut in the Northlands. Her eyes are wide and unfocused, seeing things that broke something in her mind. She rocks slowly, muttering riddles and fragments of terrible truth. Her dark hair is unkempt, her face gaunt from refusing food. Around her, the shadows seem to move—shapes of soldiers who don't know they're dead reaching toward her, whispering their confusion. A single candle gutters on the floor, its light catching the ritual scars on her hands. On the wall behind her, she has scratched symbols in charcoal—fragments of what she witnessed, warnings she cannot speak clearly. An older Spirit-Speaker watches from the doorway, afraid to enter, afraid of what Raven-Eye has become. The atmosphere of madness that comes from seeing too much truth, of a gift that has become a curse.
