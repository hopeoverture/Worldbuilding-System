# The Spirit-Speakers

## Overview
The Spirit-Speakers are practitioners of the Old Ways—the pre-Faith tradition of ancestor veneration and spirit communion that survives in the Northlands. They serve as intermediaries between the living and the dead, interpreting dreams, conducting rituals at sacred sites, and maintaining the connection between generations. The Faith of the Three tolerates them as folk tradition; the Northfolk rely on them for guidance. Now, with the dead rising in the south, the Spirit-Speakers face a crisis: the ancestors are disturbed, and something is wrong with death itself.

## Classification

**Type:** Informal Religious Tradition (not a formal organization)

**Status:** Tolerated by the Faith; central to Northland culture

**Legal Position:** Not officially recognized; not actively persecuted

## The Old Ways

### Beliefs
- The dead do not truly leave; their spirits linger to guide the living
- Ancestors watch over their descendants and can be consulted
- The land has spirits that must be respected
- Death is a transition, not an ending
- The living and dead are bound by blood and memory

### Practices
- **Ancestor Communion:** Rituals to contact and consult dead relatives
- **Dream Interpretation:** The dead speak through dreams
- **Spirit Appeasement:** Offerings to land spirits at sacred sites
- **Death Rituals:** Proper burial and passage rites
- **Prophecy:** Some Spirit-Speakers receive visions

### Sacred Sites
- [[Stoneholm]] Lake — Where Spirit-Speakers gather annually
- [[Myrkvid]] (The Dark Wood) — Ancient and powerful
- The Standing Stones — Predating the Faith
- Countless ancestor shrines throughout the Northlands

## Structure

### Leadership (Informal)
There is no formal hierarchy. Authority comes from reputation, wisdom, and demonstrated power.

**Most Respected:** Elder Yrsa the Wise, chief of Clan Myrk, Speaker for two generations

**Other Notable Speakers:**
- Raven-Eye (young, powerful, troubling visions)
- Old Thorvald (claims to speak with spirits of the land itself)
- The Silent One (never speaks aloud; communicates through dreams)

### Training
Spirit-Speaking is passed through:
- Family traditions (mother to daughter, grandmother to granddaughter)
- Apprenticeship to established Speakers
- Spontaneous awakening (recognized and guided by elders)
- Dream instruction from the ancestors themselves

### Gathering
Spirit-Speakers gather once yearly at Stoneholm Lake for:
- Comparing visions and interpretations
- Training young practitioners
- Major rituals requiring combined power
- Discussing matters affecting the Old Ways

## Relationship with the Faith

### Official Position
The Faith of the Three views Spirit-Speaking as:
- Harmless folk superstition (best case)
- Dangerous error bordering on heresy (worst case)
- Tolerated as long as practitioners don't challenge doctrine

### Practical Coexistence
- Many Northfolk observe both traditions
- Spirit-Speakers defer to the Faith in public
- The Faith rarely enforces doctrine in the deep Northlands
- Tensions exist but rarely escalate

### The Theological Problem
The rising dead in the Ashen Fields challenges both traditions. The Faith says the Chronicler guides souls to rest; the Old Ways say ancestors linger to guide the living. Neither explains dead who rise to fight old battles.

## Current Crisis

### The Ancestors Are Disturbed
Spirit-Speakers throughout the Northlands report:
- Ancestors appearing agitated in communion rituals
- Dreams filled with warnings and fear
- Land spirits withdrawing from sacred sites
- Something wrong with the passage of the dead

### Elder Yrsa's Secret
Elder Yrsa has been in communion with ancestors who witnessed the Battle of Ashen Fields. They have told her what lies beneath the mass graves—and it is older than the Three, older than the Old Ways, older than memory. She believes the south must suffer for abandoning the ancestors. She has not shared this knowledge.

### The Choice
Some Spirit-Speakers want to warn the south, despite everything. Others agree with Yrsa—let the faithless reap what they've sown. The dead will decide.

## Secrets

1. **Elder Yrsa knows what The Unnamed is.** The ancestors have told her about the thing beneath the Ashen Fields. It was here before humans. It was bound long ago. It is waking.

2. **Spirit-Speaking works differently now.** Since the rising began, communion with the dead has become easier—too easy. Some fear the boundary between living and dead is thinning everywhere.

3. **The Old Ways are growing stronger.** As the Faith weakens, the old spirits are becoming more active. Something is waking in Myrkvid that even the Spirit-Speakers cannot control.

4. **A Spirit-Speaker visited the Ashen Fields.** Raven-Eye traveled south in secret and attempted to commune with the risen dead. What she learned broke something in her. She speaks only in riddles now.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Elder's Warning:** Elder Yrsa agrees to share what she knows—but only if the party proves worthy by completing a task in Myrkvid.

2. **The Silent Speaker:** The Silent One has been sending dreams to someone in the party. She has a message—but delivering it requires entering her dreams.

3. **Raven-Eye's Riddles:** The young Spirit-Speaker who visited the Ashen Fields speaks truths hidden in madness. Can the party decode her warnings?

4. **The Gathering Interrupted:** Something attacks the annual gathering at Stoneholm. The Spirit-Speakers need protection—and answers.
