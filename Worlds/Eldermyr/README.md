# Eldermyr - Example World

Eldermyr is a complete example world demonstrating how the Worldbuilding System templates work together. Use it as reference for your own worlds or as a ready-to-play campaign setting.

## The Premise in 30 Seconds

The High King is dead. His grandson—a fifteen-year-old boy controlled by scheming nobles—holds the strongest claim to the throne, but four factions circle like wolves. Meanwhile, in the scarred lands where the last war's worst battles were fought, the dead are beginning to rise. Something ancient stirs beneath the mass graves, and it's hungry.

## Quick Facts

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Political Fantasy meets Low Fantasy Horror |
| **Era** | Late Medieval (post-civil war) |
| **Inspirations** | Game of Thrones, LOTR, Octopath Traveler |
| **State** | Succession crisis, rising undead threat |
| **Time Pressure** | War in months; apocalypse in years |

## The Twin Threats

### Political: Succession Crisis
Open war is months away. The heir is controlled by his grandfather. Every faction positions for advantage. Assassinations, marriages, alliances—all weapons in this game.

### Supernatural: The Rising Dead
In The Karath Reach, corpses from the last war are waking. They remember their loyalties—Valdren dead attack Karath, Karath dead attack Valdren. A crowned figure walks among them. Something older and hungrier stirs beneath.

## Key NPCs
