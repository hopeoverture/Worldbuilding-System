# Aldersgate

## Overview
Aldersgate is the ancient capital of Eldermyr, a city of spires and politics where the realm's fate is decided in gilded chambers and shadowed corridors. For a thousand years, the Ironthrone has stood at its heart, and whoever sits upon it—or controls who does—rules the realm. Now, with a boy heir, a scheming regent, and rival houses circling, Aldersgate has become a battlefield where daggers are hidden behind smiles and every alliance carries a price.

## Geography

### Location
Aldersgate sits at the confluence of the Kingswater River and its major tributary, commanding the fertile heart of [[The Crown Lands|the Crown Lands]]. The city sprawls across both banks, connected by the famous Kingswater Bridge—the largest stone bridge in the realm. Its position makes it the natural crossroads of every major trade route, ensuring its dominance over commerce as well as politics.

### Climate
[[The Crown Lands]] enjoy temperate weather with mild winters and warm summers. Spring rains fill the Kingswater, and autumn brings spectacular colors to the King's Wood visible from the city walls.

### Layout
The city is roughly circular, defined by three concentric rings of walls from different eras of expansion. The oldest wall surrounds the Palace Hill where the Ironthrone Hall stands. The middle wall encompasses the Old City with its temples, noble houses, and guild halls. The outer wall, built two centuries ago, contains the sprawling merchant districts, artisan quarters, and the infamous Mudside slums near the docks.

## Districts

## Demographics

### Population
**Total Population:** ~120,000
**Density:** Crowded in the outer districts, spacious on Palace Hill
**Growth:** Stable but tense—refugees from the south arriving, merchants leaving

### Social Classes
**Nobility/Elite:** Great house representatives, wealthy merchants, high clergy—perhaps 2% of the population but controlling 80% of the wealth.

**Middle Class:** Guild masters, professionals, successful merchants, minor nobles—10% of the population, anxiously watching which way the wind blows.

**Common Folk:** Workers, servants, laborers, small traders—70% of the population, concerned with survival more than succession.

**Underclass:** The poor of Mudside, beggars, criminals—18% of the population, growing as the crisis deepens.

### Species Distribution
| Species | Percentage | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| [[Humans]] | 88% | All regions represented |
| [[Elves]] | 4% | Primarily High Elves in the Starlight Quarter |
| [[Halflings]] | 4% | Servants, merchants, craftsmen throughout |
| [[Gnomes]] | 2% | Scholars at [[The Arcane Academy]], craftsmen |
| Other | 2% | Travelers, traders, diplomats |

**The Starlight Quarter:** Near [[The Arcane Academy]], the Starlight Quarter houses Aldersgate's [[Elves|High Elf]] population—approximately 5,000 elves who have maintained a presence in the capital for centuries. The quarter centers on the Tower of Stars, an elven-built spire predating the current city walls. High Elves here serve as scholars at the Academy, advisors to noble houses, and keepers of arcane lore. They observe human politics with the patience of centuries, rarely intervening but always watching. The elven elder Faelar Moonwhisper sits on no council but is consulted by every faction seeking ancient knowledge.

**Halfling Communities:** [[Halflings]] are scattered throughout the city, particularly in the Commons and Guild Row, working as servants, cooks, and small-scale merchants. They keep their heads down during the crisis, hoping to be overlooked by powers greater than themselves.

## Government & Politics

### Current Ruler
**Title & Name:** Lord Regent [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] Valdren
**In Power Since:** Three months (since [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]'s death)
**How He Rules:** Through gold, information, and careful manipulation of the Small Council
**Public Perception:** Seen as capable but self-interested; the common folk call him "the Merchant King"
**Greatest Concern:** Maintaining the fiction that [[Edric Valdren|young Edric]] will be king while ensuring [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] holds real power

### Power Structure
**Inner Circle:**
- Lady Serana Valdren (his wife, manages court)
- Master of Coin Aldwin Cole (controls treasury)
- Spymaster "The Owl" (identity secret, runs intelligence)

**Small Council:**
- Lord Regent (chair)
- Master of Coin
- Master of Laws
- Master of Whispers
- Lord Commander of the City Watch
- Representative of [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]

### Political Factions
1. **The Regency:** [[Lord Varic Valdren|Lord Varic]]'s supporters, mostly western interests and merchants
2. **The Legitimists:** Those who support [[Edric Valdren|young Edric]]'s true rule—increasingly organized
3. **[[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]]'s Voice:** [[High Confessor Maren]]'s supporters, seeking religious influence
4. **The Eastern Interest:** Agents sympathetic to [[House Thorne]], quietly building support

## Economy

### Economic Overview
Aldersgate is the commercial heart of Eldermyr. Every major trade route passes through or near the city, and the Merchant's Exchange sets prices for the entire realm. The succession crisis has disrupted normal trade—merchants are hoarding, prices are rising, and everyone watches the political winds before committing to deals.

### Primary Industries
1. **Administration:** The royal bureaucracy employs thousands
2. **Trade & Finance:** Banking, money-changing, commodity trading
3. **Craftsmanship:** Luxury goods, legal documents, fine clothing

### Markets
**Founder's Square:** The great market, operating daily, everything from food to tools
**The Silk Market:** Luxury goods, operates weekly, requires entrance fee
**The Night Market:** Unofficial, trades in things better not discussed

## Defense & Military

### City Watch
**Size:** 2,000 watchmen in three shifts
**Quality:** Variable—some districts well-patrolled, Mudside largely ignored
**Leadership:** Lord Commander Aldric Stone, loyal to the office, not the man
**Corruption Level:** Moderate—bribes common in the outer districts

### City Walls
The three rings of walls are well-maintained. The outer wall is 30 feet high with towers every 200 yards. The gates are closed from dusk to dawn. The Kingswater provides natural defense on two sides.

### Military Forces
**City Garrison:** 3,000 professional soldiers loyal to the crown
**Valdren Household Guard:** 500 elite soldiers loyal to [[Lord Varic Valdren|the regent]] personally
**Noble Retinues:** Perhaps 1,500 soldiers scattered among various households
**The Watch:** 2,000 (law enforcement, not military)

## Notable Locations

### Ironthrone Hall
The royal palace, built on the highest point of the city. The Ironthrone itself—forged from the weapons of defeated enemies a thousand years ago—sits in the Great Hall. Currently, the body of [[High King Aldric II|King Aldric]] II has been secretly preserved and placed on the throne to prevent panic while the succession is "resolved."

### The Chapel of the Fallen
A memorial to those who died in [[The Great War]]. Contains the tomb of Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] the Liberator, who killed [[The Mad King]] and died in the process. Young [[Edric Valdren]] visits often, communing with his namesake.

### The Merchant's Exchange
The economic heart of the realm, where commodity prices are set and major deals are struck. A riot here could collapse trade for months.

### The Silver Swan
The most exclusive inn in the city, where great house representatives conduct their intrigues. Neutral ground by ancient tradition—violence here is unthinkable.

### The Rat's Nest
Somewhere in Mudside, the headquarters of Aldersgate's criminal underworld. No one speaks its location, but everyone knows it exists.

## Key Figures

### [[Lord Varic Valdren]]
*See [[Lord Varic Valdren]]*
The Lord Regent, controlling the capital through gold and guile.

### [[Edric Valdren]]
*See [[Edric Valdren]]*
The boy heir, living in the palace, less a puppet than his grandfather believes.

### Lord Commander Aldric Stone
Commander of the City Garrison. A career soldier loyal to the crown itself—not to whoever wears it. Torn between duty to [[Lord Varic Valdren|the regent]] and growing unease about Valdren's true intentions.

### The Owl
The Spymaster. No one knows their true identity. They serve whoever sits the throne—or whoever pays enough to convince them they represent the throne.

### Sister Elspeth
Abbess of the Shepherd's Sanctuary, known for healing miracles. Popular with the common folk. Quietly corresponds with those concerned about [[Lord Varic Valdren|the regent]]'s ambitions.

### Elder Faelar Moonwhisper
The [[Elves|High Elf]] elder who speaks for the Starlight Quarter without holding any formal title. Faelar has lived in Aldersgate for over four hundred years and remembers every king since the unification. He sits on no council but is consulted by every faction seeking ancient knowledge—or ancient alliances. His support could legitimize any claimant; his opposition could doom them. He remains carefully neutral, watching the human drama with the patience of centuries.

### Bramble Took
An elderly [[Halflings|halfling]] who serves as informal mayor of the halfling community scattered through the Commons and Guild Row. Bramble runs a bakery that's been in his family for six generations, and his kitchen has become the unofficial meeting place for halflings worried about the coming conflict. He has no political power, but he knows every servant, cook, and household worker in the city—and they all talk to him.

## Secrets

1. **The King's Body.** [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]]'s corpse sits on the Ironthrone, preserved by Faith magic, displayed to prevent panic. The Small Council knows the truth: he was poisoned.

2. **The Tunnels.** Beneath the city, ancient tunnels connect key locations. The Owl uses them. So did the previous spymaster. So might [[Edric Valdren|young Edric]].

3. **The Valdren Debt.** [[House Valdren]] has borrowed heavily from foreign powers to fund the regency. If they lose control, those debts come due—and the creditors will want payment in territory or trade concessions.

4. **The Second Throne.** A prophecy in the White Tower archives speaks of a "throne of iron and a throne of bone." Some believe the rising dead are connected to an ancient claim on the realm itself.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Preserved King:** Someone wants proof that [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] was murdered. Getting close enough to the body to find evidence requires infiltrating the most secure place in the realm.

2. **The Tunnel Map:** An old map shows tunnels connecting the palace to locations across the city. Several factions would kill for this map—or kill whoever has it.

3. **The Merchant's Panic:** Someone is manipulating commodity prices to destabilize the regency. Finding out who reveals a conspiracy reaching to foreign shores.

4. **[[Edric Valdren]]'s Friends:** [[Edric Valdren]] is quietly gathering allies. He needs trustworthy people who aren't already compromised by one faction or another.

5. **The Owl's Price:** The Spymaster knows everything worth knowing. They're willing to share—for a price that has nothing to do with gold.

6. **The Elven Memory:** Elder Faelar Moonwhisper has begun having visions—something he hasn't experienced in three centuries. The visions concern [[The Unnamed]], and they suggest the ancient evil's awakening is connected to the succession crisis in ways no one has understood. He needs trustworthy agents to investigate while he determines whether to break the Starlight Quarter's neutrality.

7. **The Servants' Conspiracy:** Bramble Took has heard whispers from his network of halfling servants—whispers about a plot against [[Edric Valdren|young Edric]]. The conspirators don't know the servants are listening. Bramble needs someone to act on this information without revealing his sources—and without putting his people in danger.
