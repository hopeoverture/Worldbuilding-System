# Frostfang Lodge

## Overview

Deep in the pine forests between [[Vindrheim]] and [[The Myrkvid]], Frostfang Lodge was built by legendary hunter Bjorn Wolfslayer a century ago. The great timber hall served as a base for expeditions into the northern wilderness, its trophy room famous throughout [[The Northlands]] for its collection of dire wolf pelts, winter wolf heads, and the skull of a young dragon.

When Bjorn died without heirs, the lodge passed through several owners before being abandoned twenty years ago. The last owner, a merchant from [[Aldersgate]] who fancied himself a hunter, ventured too deep into [[The Myrkvid]] and never returned.

Nature has reclaimed what civilization abandoned. A pack of winter wolves, led by an unnaturally intelligent alpha, now lairs in the lodge. They've driven off lesser beasts and established the surrounding forest as their territory. Local villages lose livestock—and occasionally people—to the pack.

## Current Threat

### Snowfang (Alpha Winter Wolf)
**Winter Wolf (CR 3)** with Awakened Beast intelligence (Int 10)—effective CR 4. Snowfang is no ordinary beast; something or someone gave him human-level cunning. He leads his pack with strategy, not just instinct.

### The Frostfang Pack
- **Winter Wolves (4):** CR 3 each - The core pack
- **Dire Wolves (6):** CR 1 each - Lesser pack members
- **Wolf Swarm:** 12 regular wolves (treat as mob, CR 3 equivalent)

### Pack Tactics
The wolves don't fight stupidly. They:
- Scout approaching threats with regular wolves
- Attack in waves to exhaust defenders
- Use breath weapons to create chokepoints
- Protect Snowfang at all costs

### Total Encounter: CR 7-8 (Hard for level 5 party)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Slay the Pack (Combat)
Hunt down the wolves and claim the lodge. The northern clans will recognize anyone who can hold the territory. Key challenges:
- The pack doesn't wait inside for attackers
- Forest pursuit favors the wolves
- Regular wolves scout and alert the pack
- Snowfang will retreat and regroup if losing

**Reward:** Ownership by right of conquest; respect from northern clans.

### Option 2: Defeat Snowfang in Single Combat (Honor)
The northern clans tell legends of hunters who earned beast-respect through single combat. If a party member challenges Snowfang one-on-one and wins without killing:
- Snowfang submits and withdraws his pack
- The victor becomes "Wolf-Friend" to northern clans
- Potential future alliance with awakened wolves

This requires identifying Snowfang's intelligence and communicating the challenge (Speak with Animals or similar).

### Option 3: Discover Snowfang's Origin (Investigation)
Snowfang was awakened by a druid of the Old Ways who sought to create guardians for [[The Myrkvid]]. That druid, Ylva Treeborne, still lives in Stoneholm. If the party convinces her they'll protect the forest:
- She commands Snowfang to relocate deeper into the Myrkvid
- The party gains the lodge and a druid contact
- Future obligation to the Old Ways

### Option 4: Clan Grant (Reputation)
Prove yourself to the northern clans through other deeds, and they may ask you to deal with the Frostfang problem as a test of worthiness. Success grants:
- The lodge
- Clan hospitality throughout the Northlands
- Potential marriage alliance offers

## Location

Frostfang Lodge sits in a forest clearing 30 miles east of [[Vindrheim]], on the edge of the territory the clans call "the Wolfwood." A frozen river provides water year-round. The King's Road lies 15 miles south, accessible by a forester's track.

The surrounding forest is old-growth pine, dark and quiet. The wolves have driven off most other large predators, making the immediate area safer—if you can deal with the wolves themselves.

## Physical Description

### Exterior
The lodge is a massive timber longhouse with antler decorations and carved wolf motifs. Snow covers the roof most of the year. A stone chimney rises from the center. Outbuildings include a stable (damaged), a smokehouse, and a small tannery.

The clearing has been expanded by the wolves, who've worn paths through the snow. Bones litter the ground—elk, deer, and disturbingly, some human.

### Interior Layout
- **Great Hall:** Central fire pit, feasting tables, trophy displays on walls
- **Trophy Room:** Bjorn's collection—pelts, heads, weapons, the dragon skull
- **Private Quarters:** Former owner's rooms, ransacked by wolves
- **Bunkroom:** Communal sleeping for hunters and servants
- **Stores:** Cold storage (natural refrigeration), dried provisions (ruined)
- **Cellars:** Root cellar, mead storage (some surviving)

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Trophy Room | Present, excellent | Cleaning (50 gp) |
| Training Area | Present (yard) | Equipment (150 gp) |
| Great Hall → Pub | Present | Restocking, repairs (200 gp) |
| Stable | Damaged | Repairs (250 gp) |
| Tannery → Workshop | Present | Cleaning, tools (100 gp) |
| Armory | Space available | Construction (200 gp) |
| Menagerie | Space in stable | Conversion (300 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 950-1,250 gp

**Unique Feature:** The trophy room's existing collection is worth 1,500 gp to collectors—or provides advantage on Intimidation checks against beast-type creatures if displayed.

## Secrets

1. **Bjorn's Final Hunt:** Hidden beneath a flagstone in the trophy room is Bjorn Wolfslayer's journal. It describes his last hunt—tracking something into the Myrkvid that he called "The White Death." The trail he described leads to a location he believed housed a winter-touched dragon.

2. **The Awakening Stone:** In a cave behind the lodge, where Snowfang sometimes sleeps, lies the druidic focus used to awaken him. In the right hands, it could awaken another beast or enhance communication with animals.

3. **The Merchant's Fate:** The last owner didn't die in the Myrkvid—he fled to [[Aldersgate]] after the wolves first appeared. He still legally owns the lodge and could contest new ownership unless dealt with. He'd accept 200 gp to sign away his claim.

## DM Notes

### Combat Dynamics
Fighting the wolf pack is complex:
- They won't all be in the lodge
- Regular wolves scout and retreat to warn the pack
- Winter wolves use hit-and-run tactics in the forest
- The pack protects Snowfang obsessively

Consider running this as a multi-encounter hunt rather than a single fight.

### Snowfang's Intelligence
Snowfang is cunning but not evil. He protects his pack and his territory. If the party shows respect for nature and strength in battle, he might negotiate—especially if they spare wolves they could have killed.

### Campaign Integration
Frostfang Lodge makes an excellent base for Northlands adventures:
- Expeditions into the Myrkvid
- Alliance-building with clans
- Hunting exotic beasts
- Investigating the "White Death" from Bjorn's journal

### Winter Survival
The Northlands are harsh. Parties using the lodge need to plan for winter supplies, firewood, and cold weather hazards. The lodge is well-suited to survive winter—if properly stocked.
