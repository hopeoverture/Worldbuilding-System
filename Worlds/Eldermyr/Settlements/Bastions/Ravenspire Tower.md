# Ravenspire Tower

## Overview

Ravenspire Tower rises five stories above the moorland southeast of [[Aldersgate]], its black stone walls stark against the grey skies of [[The Crown Lands]]. Once the home of Magister Elias Corvane, a royal court wizard who served three generations of kings, the tower has stood abandoned for thirty years since the magister's mysterious death. Ravens nest in its upper reaches—hence its name—and locals speak of lights flickering in the windows on moonless nights.

The tower is structurally sound despite decades of neglect, its magical wards still partially functioning. Inside, Corvane's ghost and several spectral servants guard his unfinished research, unable to rest until someone completes his life's work or puts his spirit to peace.

## Current Threat

### The Wraith of Magister Corvane
**CR 5** - The magister died while attempting to create a spell that would allow communication with the dead kings of Eldermyr. The ritual backfired, trapping his soul in the tower. He manifests as a gaunt figure in tattered robes, surrounded by swirling raven feathers.

**Motivation:** Corvane doesn't seek to harm intruders—he wants someone capable enough to complete his research. However, his madness makes him attack first to "test" worthiness.

### Spectral Servants (4)
**CR 1 each** - Former apprentices and servants who died in the failed ritual. They mindlessly patrol the tower and attack any living creature.

### Animated Armor (2)
**CR 1 each** - Guardian constructs on the ground floor that activate when intruders enter.

### Total Encounter: CR 7-8 (Hard for level 5 party)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Defeat and Banish (Combat)
Clear the tower by destroying Corvane's wraith and all guardians. The tower becomes legally claimable as abandoned property. The Crown may grant it to adventurers who solve the "haunting problem."

### Option 2: Complete Corvane's Research (Quest)
Corvane's ritual was almost successful. By gathering three components—a fragment of a dead king's crown, ashes from a royal pyre, and a scepter of office—players can complete the ritual safely. This puts Corvane to rest peacefully, and his grateful spirit bequeaths the tower.

**Quest Components:**
- Crown fragment: In [[Thornhall]] catacombs (requires Church permission)
- Royal ashes: The Old Palace ruins (dangerous, requires exploration)
- Scepter: Held by a noble family; requires diplomacy or theft

### Option 3: Royal Grant (Favor)
The Crown offers the tower as reward for significant service to the realm during the succession crisis. Corvane must still be dealt with, but the party has legal claim regardless.

## Location

Ravenspire stands on Blackmoor Heath, a windswept moorland 15 miles southeast of [[Aldersgate]]. The King's Road passes within 3 miles, making it accessible yet private. The nearest village, Moorwatch, lies 4 miles north—close enough for supplies but far enough for privacy.

The tower commands views across the moor to the distant [[King's Wood]]. On clear days, the spires of Aldersgate are visible to the northwest.

## Physical Description

### Exterior
The tower is constructed of dark basalt quarried from the Ostmark Range, giving it an almost black appearance. It rises 80 feet across five floors, topped by a copper-domed observatory now green with verdigris. A single iron-bound door serves as entrance, flanked by carved ravens. The windows are narrow and defensible, with intact glass enchanted against weather.

A low wall surrounds a courtyard containing an overgrown herb garden, a dry well, and a collapsed stable.

### Interior Layout
- **Ground Floor:** Entry hall, kitchen, storage, guardian alcoves
- **Second Floor:** Common room, guest quarters, servant rooms
- **Third Floor:** Arcane study and workroom (Corvane's primary workspace)
- **Fourth Floor:** Private quarters, scriptorium, meditation chamber
- **Fifth Floor:** Library (extensive collection, some damaged)
- **Observatory Dome:** Magical telescope, astronomical instruments

## Potential Facilities

Once cleared, Ravenspire could support these bastion facilities:

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Arcane Study | Present, corrupted | Cleansing, repair (200 gp) |
| Library | Present, extensive | Organization, restoration (150 gp) |
| Observatory | Present, damaged | Lens repair, calibration (300 gp) |
| Scriptorium | Space available | Furnishing (100 gp) |
| Meditation Chamber | Space available | Conversion (50 gp) |
| Bedroom | Present | Cleaning only |
| Kitchen | Present | Restocking (50 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 850 gp (reduced if Corvane helps peacefully)

## Secrets

1. **Corvane's Hidden Vault:** Behind a false wall on the fourth floor lies a vault containing Corvane's most dangerous research, including notes on contacting entities beyond death. The vault requires a password spoken in Sylvan.

2. **The Speaking Stone:** The observatory contains a scrying device that, once repaired, can communicate with other towers built by the same architect—including one in [[Porto Valdris]] and one that sank beneath the waves centuries ago.

3. **Buried in the Courtyard:** Corvane's apprentice Mira didn't die in the ritual—she was murdered beforehand because she discovered her master's true purpose. Her bones lie beneath the herb garden, and her ghost occasionally appears to those who might bring her justice.

- **Level 5-6 party:** As written (CR 7-8)
- **Level 7+ party:** Add Shadow Demon bound in study (CR 4)

### Campaign Integration
Corvane's research into speaking with dead kings could reveal secrets about [[The Iron Crown]], the succession, or the true history of the realm. His speaking stone connects to a network that could become a campaign-spanning communication system.

### Renovation Timeline
- Basic habitability: 1 week
- Full restoration: 1 month
- Facility upgrades: Per bastion rules
