# Shadowfen Priory

## Overview

Before the war that broke [[House Karath]], Shadowfen Priory was a beacon of [[The Church of the Three]] in the southern reaches. The monks of St. Aldric the Merciful tended a hospital for the sick, maintained extensive theological texts, and brewed a honey mead renowned throughout Eldermyr.

When [[The Ashen Fields]] erupted with undeath, the priory's defenders—led by Prior Benedictus—made a heroic stand to allow refugees to escape. They succeeded, but the curse claimed them nonetheless. Now Prior Benedictus walks the halls as a death knight, his monks as undead servants, forever performing rituals that no longer mean anything.

The priory sits at the northern edge of [[The Karath Reach]], close enough to the spreading curse to be dangerous, far enough that it might be reclaimed—if heroes can put the prior and his flock to rest.

## Current Threat

### Prior Benedictus
**Death Knight (CR 17)** — *weakened by faith conflict* to effective CR 8. Benedictus retained his paladin abilities but is tormented by what he's become. He cannot willingly stop attacking the living, but part of him yearns for release. His weakened state reflects his internal struggle.

**Special:** Benedictus can be reasoned with between combats if shown holy symbols or reminded of his vows. He cannot stop fighting permanently without intervention, but he can provide information, hesitate at crucial moments, or "accidentally" reveal his weaknesses.

### The Undead Brothers
- **Wights (6):** CR 3 each - Former warrior-monks, patrol the grounds
- **Specters (4):** CR 1 each - Monks who died in particularly anguished circumstances
- **Skeletons (20):** CR 1/4 - Animated bones, perform mindless routines
- **Will-o'-Wisps (2):** CR 2 - Drawn by the suffering, not part of the monastery

### The Corruption
The priory's holy ground resists the curse but is losing. Each month, the corruption spreads further into the building. Areas still partially consecrated are painful to undead; fully corrupt areas spawn new undead spontaneously.

### Total Encounter: CR 10-12 (Deadly for level 7 party without preparation)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Destroy the Undead (Combat)
Kill Prior Benedictus and all his monks. Purge the corruption by force. The Church of [[The Three]] will grant the priory to proven champions who reclaim holy ground.

This approach is straightforward but tragic—Benedictus and many monks could be redeemed rather than destroyed.

### Option 2: Redeem Prior Benedictus (Quest)
The death knight can be freed from his curse through specific actions:
- Recover the relics of St. Aldric from [[Thornhall]] and use them to remind Benedictus of his vows
- Find the names of every refugee the monks died to save and speak them aloud in the chapel
- Complete Benedictus's final unfulfilled duty—escorting a specific family's descendant to safety

Redemption destroys Benedictus's undead form peacefully. The remaining undead, bound to his will, collapse. The priory is purified instantly.

### Option 3: Church Crusade (Support Role)
Report the priory's state to [[The Church of the Three]]. High Priest Marcus leads a crusade to reclaim it. The party serves as elite support:
- Clear the way for the priests
- Protect the ritual of purification
- Confront Benedictus directly

Success grants the priory, Church alliance, and holy relics.

### Option 4: Contain the Threat (Temporary)
If full purification is impossible, the party can:
- Strengthen the remaining consecrated ground
- Seal Benedictus in the crypt
- Ward the priory against the curse's expansion

This buys time (6 months to a year) but doesn't resolve the situation. The Church grants use of the priory but not ownership until full purification.

## Location

Shadowfen Priory sits on a hill overlooking the Blackfen Marsh, 15 miles north of [[The Ashen Fields]] and 40 miles south of [[Chernogrod]]. The marsh provides natural isolation; only a single causeway connects the priory hill to solid ground.

The location is strategically valuable for monitoring the curse's expansion and potentially staging operations against [[The Ashen Fields]].

## Physical Description

### Exterior
Grey stone walls surround a cluster of buildings in the severe style favored by the Order of St. Aldric. A bell tower rises above the chapel. Gardens that once provided medicinal herbs are now withered and grey. The marsh presses close, mist rising from stagnant water.

At night, faint lights move within the buildings—the undead performing hollow echoes of their living routines.

### Interior Layout
- **Chapel:** The heart of the priory, partially consecrated, Benedictus's throne
- **Hospital Wing:** Where the sick were treated, now full of skeletal patients
- **Scriptorium:** Library and copying room, texts partially intact
- **Dormitory:** Monks' cells, specters haunt here
- **Refectory:** Dining hall, skeletal monks "eat" in silence
- **Cellars:** Brewery, storage, some holy items hidden here
- **Crypt:** Burial place for honored brothers, sealed

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chapel → Sanctuary | Present, desecrated | Reconsecration (Church provides) |
| Scriptorium → Library | Present, partially damaged | Restoration (200 gp) |
| Hospital → Sanctuary (2nd) | Present, corrupted | Major purification (400 gp) |
| Garden | Present, blighted | Cleansing, replanting (300 gp) |
| Meditation Chambers | Present, haunted | Cleansing (100 gp) |
| Cellars → Brewery/Storehouse | Present, intact | Cleaning, restocking (150 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 1,000-1,200 gp (reduced if Church assists)

**Unique Feature:** If fully purified, the chapel functions as enhanced Sanctuary (healing effects +2, undead cannot enter). The brewery, once restored, can produce the legendary St. Aldric's Mead—worth 10 gp per bottle, grants +1 to saves against fear for 24 hours.

## Secrets

1. **The Hidden Relic:** St. Aldric's finger bone lies in a secret compartment beneath the altar. It's the key to Benedictus's redemption—if touched to his forehead while his true name (Brother Marcus Benedictus Aldric) is spoken, he receives a saving throw against his curse.

2. **The Survivor:** One monk, Brother Thomas, escaped to [[Volkovka]] and still lives. Now elderly and traumatized, he knows the names of every refugee saved—crucial for the redemption ritual. He also knows the secret passages within the priory.

3. **The Creeping Curse:** Hidden documents reveal that the Ashen Fields curse isn't natural—it was created, and someone fed it intentionally. The priory's records partially identify the ritual used. This information is valuable to anyone seeking to stop or reverse the curse.

## DM Notes

### Benedictus Roleplay
The death knight is a tragic figure, not a cackling villain. Play him as tormented:
- He apologizes as he attacks
- He warns the party to flee between encounters
- He drops hints about his true name and the hidden relic
- He thanks heroes who put him to rest

### Curse Mechanics
The priory is a "battlefield" between holy ground and the Ashen Fields curse:
- Consecrated areas: Undead have disadvantage; holy water functions at double strength
- Neutral areas: Normal rules
- Corrupted areas: Healing spells require DC 10 check or fail; undead gain temporary HP

### Campaign Integration
Shadowfen Priory is a forward base against [[The Ashen Fields]]. Owning it means:
- First warning of curse expansion
- Base for expeditions to the Fields
- Alliance with Church templars
- Target for Karath reprisal or Ashen Fields creatures

### Redemption Path
If the party pursues redemption rather than destruction, track their progress:
- Recover St. Aldric's relics: 1 point
- Find Brother Thomas: 1 point
- Learn the refugee names: 1 point
- Speak names in the chapel: 1 point
- Use the hidden relic: 1 point
- 3+ points: Benedictus can be redeemed with final confrontation
- 5 points: Benedictus redeems himself without combat
