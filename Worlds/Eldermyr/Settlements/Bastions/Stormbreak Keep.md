# Stormbreak Keep

## Overview

Perched on a rocky promontory along the southern coast of [[The Western Shore]], Stormbreak Keep was once a naval outpost protecting merchant shipping from pirates. The irony is not lost on anyone that it now serves as headquarters for Captain Darius Blacktide and his crew of forty cutthroats.

The keep commands a hidden cove accessible only by sea, with treacherous rocks guarding the approach. Blacktide has operated from here for five years, preying on [[Porto Valdris]] shipping and ransoming wealthy captives. The Valdren navy has tried twice to root him out; both attempts ended in disaster on the rocks.

The fortress is well-maintained—pirates need solid walls—and includes a serviceable dock, barracks, and a tavern Blacktide calls "The Drowned Gull."

## Current Threat

### Captain Darius Blacktide
**Bandit Captain (CR 2) with Swashbuckler abilities (effective CR 4)**
A charismatic scoundrel who styles himself a "liberator of excessive wealth." Blacktide is cunning, ruthless in combat, but honors parley. He wears a magical coat that allows him to breathe underwater.

### First Mate Cruel Maren
**Veteran (CR 3)** - A scarred woman who handles discipline and tactics. More dangerous than Blacktide in a straight fight.

### The Crew (40 pirates)
- **Elite Pirates (8):** Thugs (CR 1/2)
- **Common Pirates (24):** Bandits (CR 1/8)
- **Specialists (8):** 2 Scouts, 2 Priests of a sea god, 4 Berserkers

### Sea Hag Alliance
**Sea Hag (CR 2)** - Moira of the Deep lives in the cove and warns Blacktide of approaching ships in exchange for "gifts" (victims). She's the real reason naval assaults fail.

### Total Encounter: CR 10-12 (Deadly for level 7 party; requires strategy)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Assault the Keep (Combat)
A direct assault is suicidal without preparation. Success requires:
- Neutralizing Moira (diplomacy, bribery with magic items, or killing her in her lair first)
- Naval support or infiltration during a storm when the cove is accessible
- Dealing with Blacktide personally (he'll flee if the battle turns)

[[House Valdren]] will grant the keep to anyone who eliminates the pirate threat.

### Option 2: Claim Blacktide's Bounty (Hunt)
Captain Blacktide has a 5,000 gp bounty from Porto Valdris. Capture or kill him (without destroying the keep) and claim both the bounty and the fortress as reward.

**Blacktide's Weaknesses:**
- He visits the mainland monthly to see his daughter (secretly) in [[Serenzia]]
- His crew includes three who'd betray him for the right price
- The sea hag wants a particular artifact more than she wants victims

### Option 3: Become the New Captain (Social/Combat)
Challenge Blacktide to single combat for leadership. By pirate law, the winner claims all. The crew will follow whoever wins—they're practical about leadership transitions. This requires getting a challenge accepted, which requires reputation as a dangerous fighter.

### Option 4: Negotiate a Pardon (Diplomacy)
In exchange for Blacktide's fleet turning privateer against [[House Karath]] shipping, the Crown might pardon him and his crew. The keep would go to whoever brokered the deal—likely the party if they convinced Blacktide. This leaves an awkward relationship with the former pirates.

## Location

Stormbreak Keep occupies Cape Fury, a rocky headland 40 miles south of [[Porto Valdris]]. The cape is surrounded by ship-killing rocks except for a single navigable channel known only to the pirates. The main road passes 5 miles inland; a hidden trail connects the keep to it.

The cove provides shelter for three ships and has a natural freshwater spring. The surrounding cliffs are home to seabirds whose eggs supplement the pirates' diet.

## Physical Description

### Exterior
Built of grey granite with a single square tower, the keep is modest in size but formidable in position. Walls 20 feet high protect a courtyard that overlooks the cove below. A crane system lowers supplies from the cliff edge to the dock 80 feet below.

Crude additions include wooden watchtowers on the clifftops and a system of warning bells.

### Interior Layout
- **Tower (3 floors):** Blacktide's quarters (top), officers' quarters (middle), armory (ground)
- **Main Hall:** Common room and "Drowned Gull" tavern
- **Barracks Wing:** Crew quarters, 40-man capacity
- **Kitchen/Stores:** Supplies, rum, plunder awaiting fencing
- **Dock Level:** Sea cave with wooden dock, boat storage, sea hag's lair nearby

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Barracks | Present, functional | Cleaning (50 gp) |
| Armory | Present, well-stocked | Inventory, organization (none) |
| Pub (Drowned Gull) | Present, rustic | Renovation optional (100 gp) |
| Dock/Harbor | Present, excellent | None |
| War Room | Space in tower | Conversion (150 gp) |
| Storehouse | Present | Cleaning, inventory (50 gp) |
| Workshop | Space available | Construction (200 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 450-550 gp

**Unique Feature:** The dock and cove function as a superior Stable equivalent for ships.

## Secrets

1. **The Hidden Treasury:** Blacktide's accumulated plunder—estimated at 12,000 gp in coins, gems, and goods—is hidden in a sea cave only accessible at low tide. The location is known only to Blacktide and Cruel Maren.

2. **Moira's Bargain:** The sea hag doesn't just want gifts—she's bound to the cove by an ancient compact and wants freedom. The binding stone is somewhere in the keep's foundation. Destroy it, and she either becomes an ally or a much bigger problem.

3. **The Signal Tower:** The keep's tower was originally part of a coastal warning system. Its beacon, if relit, can communicate with [[Porto Valdris]] and two other coastal points—useful for legitimate owners.

## DM Notes

### Tactical Considerations
The keep cannot be taken by frontal assault without massive losses. Options include:
- Stealth infiltration during a celebration
- Posing as merchants with plunder to fence
- Turning crew members against Blacktide
- Alliance with or elimination of Moira first
- Naval blockade and starvation (6+ months)

### Campaign Integration
Stormbreak Keep makes an excellent base for parties interested in naval adventure, trade protection, or Western Shore politics. The signal tower connects to the coastal defense network, making owners valuable to [[House Valdren]].

### Blacktide's Fate
If Blacktide survives and loses his keep, he becomes a recurring antagonist seeking revenge. If turned privateer, he's an unreliable ally who might revert to piracy.
