# The Burned Hold

## Overview

The Burned Hold was once Ashkeep, a proud fortress guarding a secondary pass through the mountains into [[The Eastern March]]. Sixty years ago, during a siege by foreign raiders, the commander made a desperate pact with something in the flames. The fortress held—but at a terrible cost.

The garrison burned alive, their screams echoing for three days. The raiders fled in terror. Now the Hold stands blackened but intact, its stones permanently warm to the touch. The soldiers who died in flame have risen as fiery undead, forever defending a fortress no one wants to attack. At the heart of the ruins, in the great forge that was Ashkeep's pride, dwells the Fire Elemental that answered the commander's call—still waiting to collect the full price of its bargain.

[[House Thorne]] officially considers the fortress lost. Unofficially, they would pay handsomely to anyone who could reclaim it and cleanse the curse.

## Current Threat

### Infernal Ember (Fire Elemental)
**Fire Elemental (CR 5)** bound and empowered by the pact—functions as CR 7. Cannot be permanently killed until the pact is broken. Regenerates in the great forge after 24 hours if destroyed.

### Commander Aldric Ashburn
**Flameskull (CR 4)** - The commander who made the pact. His skull floats above the war room, issuing orders to his undead garrison. He retains fragments of sanity and can potentially be reasoned with.

### The Burning Garrison
- **Flame-Touched Wights (6):** Wights (CR 3) with fire damage on attacks
- **Flame-Touched Zombies (20):** Zombies (CR 1/4) wreathed in flames
- **Blazing Hounds (4):** Hell Hounds (CR 3)

### Environmental Hazards
- Stone surfaces deal 1 fire damage per round of contact
- Some areas have ambient heat (Constitution saves or exhaustion)
- The forge room deals 2d6 fire damage per round

### Total Encounter: CR 12-14 (Deadly for level 9 party)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Break the Pact (Quest)
The pact can only be broken by fulfilling or annulling its terms. Commander Ashburn promised "the fortress's eternal service." Options:
- Find the commander's descendants and have them formally release Ashkeep from service
- Convince Ashburn his duty is complete (the raiders are long dead)
- Destroy the original pact document (hidden in the elemental's flames)
- Perform a ritual requiring materials from the Plane of Fire

Breaking the pact releases all souls and banishes the elemental. [[House Thorne]] grants the fortress to the heroes.

### Option 2: Subjugate the Elemental (Combat/Magic)
Powerful magic can bind or banish the elemental permanently. This doesn't lift the curse but makes the fortress habitable. The undead must still be destroyed, and the stones remain warm.

**Requires:** 9th level spellcaster or artifact-level binding

### Option 3: Appease the Elemental (Bargain)
The elemental wants to return to its plane but cannot leave without "payment." It will accept:
- 100 souls (absolutely not acceptable to good parties)
- A gate to the Plane of Fire (the elemental goes home)
- A new pact (dangerous—the elemental is not trustworthy)

Creating a gate requires rare components and high-level magic but ends the haunting peacefully.

### Option 4: Consecration (Divine)
A high priest of [[The Church of the Three]] could consecrate the fortress, driving out the elemental and releasing the souls. This requires:
- A relic of significant power
- Three days of continuous ritual
- Defense against the elemental's counterattack during the ritual

[[House Thorne]] and the Church would share gratitude, granting the fortress and Church favor.

## Location

The Burned Hold guards Cinder Pass, a narrow route through the mountains 25 miles north of [[Stahlburg]]. The pass sees little traffic now—merchants avoid it out of superstition, and the main trade route uses Ostmark Pass instead.

The fortress occupies a natural chokepoint where the pass narrows between two peaks. Its walls span the entire gap, making it impossible to bypass.

## Physical Description

### Exterior
The fortress walls are blackened but structurally sound, the stones fused by supernatural heat. The main gate hangs partially open, twisted by fire. Guard towers still stand at intervals, their arrow slits glowing faintly with inner light.

A perpetual heat haze hangs over the fortress despite mountain cold. Snow melts within 100 feet of the walls. At night, the windows glow orange as if lit by flames within.

### Interior Layout
- **Gatehouse:** Collapsed mechanism, environmental hazards
- **Outer Ward:** Barracks, stables (burned), well (now a heat vent)
- **Inner Ward:** Great hall, armory, kitchens
- **Keep:** Commander's quarters, war room (Ashburn's location)
- **Great Forge:** Underground, the elemental's lair, heart of the curse

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Barracks | Fire-damaged | Major rebuild (500 gp) |
| Armory | Damaged, some intact | Restoration (300 gp) |
| Smithy | Corrupted | Cleansing, rebuild (400 gp) |
| War Room | Intact but haunted | Cleansing, repair (200 gp) |
| Training Area | Outer ward, damaged | Clearing, equipment (250 gp) |
| Stables | Destroyed | Complete rebuild (350 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 2,000+ gp

**Unique Feature:** If the forge is cleansed rather than destroyed, it retains supernatural properties—items crafted there gain +1 to fire resistance or fire damage.

## Secrets

1. **The Pact Document:** The original pact, written in Ashburn's blood on fire-resistant vellum, lies within the elemental's core. Destroying it (requiring someone to reach into the elemental) breaks the pact instantly.

2. **The Hidden Survivors:** Three soldiers escaped the burning by sealing themselves in the cistern. Their descendants live in [[Stahlburg]], unaware of their heritage. They could formally release Ashkeep from its oath.

3. **The Elemental's True Name:** Hidden in Ashburn's journals (in the war room) is the elemental's true name—Pyraxis. Speaking it gives momentary control, enough to command it through the gate or make it pause during combat.

## DM Notes

### Encounter Approach
This is a high-level dungeon requiring significant preparation. The elemental cannot be permanently defeated through combat alone—parties must research the pact and find a solution.

### Fire Resistance
Parties without fire resistance will struggle. The environment deals consistent fire damage. Potions of Fire Resistance should be available in [[Stahlburg]] at reasonable prices.

### Campaign Integration
Reclaiming the Burned Hold reopens Cinder Pass, changing trade dynamics in [[The Eastern March]]. [[House Thorne]] becomes strongly allied with the party. The supernatural forge could produce legendary weapons.

### Ashburn's Redemption
If the party treats Commander Ashburn with respect and helps him understand his duty is complete, his spirit can provide valuable tactical information about the fortress—and reveal the elemental's true name.
