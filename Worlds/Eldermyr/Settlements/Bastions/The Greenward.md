# The Greenward

## Overview

Deep within [[The King's Wood]], where the oldest oaks grow and sunlight filters through ancient canopy, lies a clearing known as the Greenward. For centuries, druids of the Old Ways gathered here to honor nature, perform seasonal rituals, and maintain the balance between civilization and wilderness.

When the Church of [[The Three]] rose to dominance, the druids were driven out. The Greenward was abandoned, its standing stones left to be swallowed by undergrowth. But sacred ground doesn't forget. The nature spirits that dwelled here grew resentful, then bitter, then twisted.

Now the Greenward is a place of dark fey and corrupted nature. A dryad named Thornweep, once a gentle guardian, has become a creature of vengeance. She and her blighted servants prey on any who enter the deep wood, seeing all mortals as enemies of nature.

## Current Threat

### Thornweep
**Dryad (CR 1)** merged with a corrupt treant spirit—effective CR 4. She can animate trees (2 per round), charm mortals, and is bound to a massive blighted oak at the grove's center. Destroying the oak destroys her—but also removes the grove's magical properties permanently.

### Blighted Creatures
- **Twig Blights (12):** CR 1/8 - Scouts and harassers throughout the surrounding forest
- **Vine Blights (4):** CR 1/2 - Guard the approaches to the grove
- **Needle Blights (6):** CR 1/4 - Ranged support within the grove
- **Awakened Trees (2):** CR 2 - Thornweep's bodyguards

### Corrupted Allies
- **Will-o'-Wisp (1):** CR 2 - Leads travelers into ambushes
- **Quickling (1):** CR 1 - Spy and assassin, serves Thornweep out of malice

### The Wood Itself
The forest around the Greenward actively impedes intruders:
- Paths shift and mislead
- Roots trip at crucial moments
- Animals spy for Thornweep
- The canopy blocks sunlight, limiting visibility

### Total Encounter: CR 7-8 (Hard for level 5 party; environmental challenges significant)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Cleanse the Corruption (Combat/Ritual)
Destroy Thornweep and her minions, then perform a purification ritual to restore the grove. This requires:
- Defeating the blighted creatures
- Finding a way to kill Thornweep without destroying her oak (separate her spirit first)
- Performing a ritual (Druid, Cleric, or Ranger with nature connection)

**Reward:** The grove becomes a sacred site again. Druids or nature-connected characters can claim it.

### Option 2: Redeem Thornweep (Quest)
The dryad wasn't always evil. Her corruption stems from a specific wound—a noble's son killed her sacred deer 50 years ago, and the Church blessed the deed. If the party can:
- Find descendants of that noble (House Marwyn, incidentally)
- Arrange genuine atonement (not just words—sacrifice or service)
- Heal Thornweep's wounded spirit

She becomes an ally, and the grove is restored with her as willing guardian.

### Option 3: Druid Circle Restoration (Faction)
The Old Ways druids still exist in the Northlands. If the party can convince a druid circle to reclaim the Greenward:
- Druids provide knowledge and ritual support
- Party provides protection during the cleansing
- Grove becomes shared between party and druid circle

This creates an ongoing relationship with Old Ways practitioners—valuable but potentially conflicting with [[The Church of the Three]].

### Option 4: Natural Succession (Patience)
A powerful enough nature spirit could simply overwhelm Thornweep. If the party can attract such a spirit (through deeds, offerings, or alliances):
- New spirit claims the grove
- Thornweep is driven out or destroyed
- Party inherits the grove as the spirit's "champions"

Finding and attracting such a spirit is an adventure in itself.

## Location

The Greenward lies 8 miles into [[The King's Wood]], accessed only by overgrown forest paths. The nearest settlement is the village of Woodsedge, 12 miles distant. [[Aldersgate]] is 30 miles to the north.

The grove occupies a natural hollow surrounded by ancient oaks. A stream runs through it, feeding a small pool. The standing stones of the old druid circle remain, though moss-covered and tilted.

## Physical Description

### The Grove
A clearing roughly 200 feet across, dominated by a massive oak at its center—Thornweep's tree, now twisted and dark. Standing stones form a broken circle around the oak. The ground is covered in thick moss and fallen leaves. Mushrooms grow in suspicious profusion.

The pool was once clear; now it's dark and still. Nothing reflects in its surface.

### Surrounding Forest
The old-growth forest around the Greenward is dense and hostile while Thornweep rules. Massive oaks block sunlight, their branches forming an almost solid canopy. Animal trails lead deliberately into traps.

### Living Structures
The druids once shaped living buildings from intertwined trees—some of these structures remain, dormant and waiting to be reawakened.

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Sacred Grove → Sanctuary | Present, corrupted | Purification ritual (special) |
| Druid Garden | Present, blighted | Cleansing, replanting (250 gp) |
| Stone Circle → Meditation Chamber | Present, damaged | Repair, reconsecrate (200 gp) |
| Forest → Menagerie | Natural habitat | Befriend creatures (time, not gold) |
| Living Tree → Greenhouse | Dormant | Awakening ritual (100 gp) |
| Oral Tradition → Library | Lost | Rebuild from druid contacts (ongoing) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 500-600 gp (plus ritual components)

**Unique Feature:** A purified Greenward provides the following benefits:
- Long rests fully restore all HP and Hit Dice
- Druidic spells cast here are at +1 DC
- The grove produces rare herbs worth 50 gp/month
- Animal messengers can be sent throughout [[The King's Wood]]

## Secrets

1. **The First Tree:** The central oak isn't just Thornweep's tree—it's a seedling of the First Tree, an entity older than the gods. If properly awakened (not cleansed, but *awakened*), it could grant extraordinary power over plant life across Eldermyr. The Church fears this, which is why they drove out the druids.

2. **The Buried Circle:** Beneath the standing stones lies an older circle, predating humans entirely. The fey built it. Excavating it would reveal passages to the Feywild—opportunities and dangers alike.

3. **Thornweep's Memory:** The dryad has lived for centuries. Her memories, if accessed peacefully, contain knowledge of lost magic, forgotten history, and secrets of noble houses. She witnessed events no living person remembers.

## DM Notes

### Nature vs. Civilization Theme
The Greenward embodies the tension between the Old Ways and modern Eldermyr. Parties who claim it must navigate:
- Church suspicion (druids are heretics to some)
- Druid expectations (if allied with Old Ways)
- Noble interference (the forest is "royal" land technically)
- Nature's demands (the grove has its own agenda)

### Thornweep Roleplay
If players attempt diplomacy, Thornweep is:
- Initially hostile, attacking on sight
- Willing to talk if overwhelmed or approached correctly (Sylvan language, druid status, offerings)
- Tragic, not evil—her anger comes from real wounds
- Capable of being moved by genuine remorse or sacrifice

### Combat Dynamics
The forest fights for Thornweep:
- Difficult terrain everywhere
- Cover favors the blights
- Thornweep can disappear into trees and reappear elsewhere
- Destroying the central oak is pyrrhic victory (grove loses magic)

### Campaign Integration
The Greenward connects to:
- Old Ways vs. Church of the Three conflict
- The spreading blight from [[The Ashen Fields]] (could reach here)
- Fey politics (the buried circle)
- Forest gnome and wood elf alliances
- Noble politics (House Marwyn's guilt)
