# The Iron Redoubt

## Overview

The Iron Redoubt—Járnvik in the dwarven tongue—was an outpost built by the dwarves of [[Hammerhall]] to protect a rich iron vein in the foothills of [[The Greycrowns]]. For two centuries, ore flowed from its mines to the great forges. Then, fifteen years ago, the miners broke through into a forgotten passage.

What emerged killed half the garrison in a single night.

The surviving dwarves sealed the lower mines and abandoned the outpost rather than risk whatever lurked below. The entrance was warded, the location marked as cursed in dwarven records. [[Hammerhall]] lost the iron vein but gained safety—or so they thought.

Six months ago, duergar raiders bypassed the seals from below. These grey dwarves, twisted by the Underdark, now occupy the outpost. They've enslaved the local wildlife, begun extracting iron, and are preparing to expand their territory. The surface dwarves don't yet know their old fortress has new occupants.

## Current Threat

### Commander Nargul Stoneblight
**Duergar (CR 1)** with class levels (Fighter 5)—effective CR 4. Nargul is ambitious, cruel, and sees the Iron Redoubt as the first step in establishing a duergar foothold on the surface.

### Duergar Raiders
- **Duergar Warriors (8):** CR 1 each - The raiding force
- **Duergar Mind Master (1):** CR 2 - Psychic torturer and interrogator
- **Duergar Stone Guard (2):** CR 2 each - Elite personal guards

### Enslaved Creatures
- **Giant Spiders (4):** CR 1 each - Guard the approaches
- **Rust Monsters (2):** CR 1/2 each - Used to process ore

### The Sealed Horror
Whatever killed the original garrison remains in the sealed lower mines. The duergar haven't opened those passages—yet. (DM choice: could be a umber hulk, a purple worm fragment, or something worse.)

### Total Encounter: CR 8-10 (Hard for level 6 party)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Clear the Duergar (Combat)
Assault the outpost and eliminate the duergar threat. Challenges:
- Duergar can turn invisible—ambush tactics
- Spider sentries alert the garrison
- Nargul has a teleportation escape if losing

Afterwards, [[Hammerhall]] will grant the outpost to capable defenders—dwarves prefer having allies hold it rather than leaving it empty.

### Option 2: Expose the Threat to Hammerhall (Quest)
The dwarves don't know about the duergar occupation. Bring proof to [[Master Thrain Stonehammer]] in Hammerhall:
- Dwarven forces assault the outpost
- Party participates in the battle
- Dwarves grant the outpost as reward and forward position

This approach brings dwarven allies but makes the party targets for duergar revenge.

### Option 3: Drive Off the Duergar, Seal the Depths (Combat/Quest)
The duergar tunnels lead to the Underdark. Permanently sealing them requires:
- Defeating the duergar
- Recovering the original dwarven sealing rituals from Hammerhall
- Completing the ritual while defending against Underdark reinforcements

Success makes the outpost secure. Hammerhall grants ownership and ongoing support.

### Option 4: Duergar Bargain (Risky Diplomacy)
Nargul might negotiate if sufficiently impressed. He wants:
- Trade access to surface iron markets
- No interference with his mining
- Information about dwarven defenses

This is morally dubious and creates major problems if discovered. However, it could create a complex ally—or a knife waiting for the party's back.

## Location

The Iron Redoubt sits in a narrow valley 20 miles northeast of [[Hammerhall]], where the plains meet [[The Greycrowns]]. The iron vein it guards runs through the eastern ridge. A mountain stream provides water, and pine forests cover the surrounding slopes.

A dwarven-built road connects to Hammerhall, though it's overgrown from fifteen years of disuse.

## Physical Description

### Exterior
Classic dwarven construction: squat, solid, built to last millennia. Grey stone walls 15 feet high surround a compound of three buildings. A single gate of iron-banded oak faces the valley approach. Watchtowers anchor each corner.

The duergar have strung webs across the approach (spider sentries) and posted hidden lookouts.

### Interior Layout
- **Main Hall:** Great hall, kitchen, common rooms—duergar quarters now
- **Barracks:** Dormitory, armory, guard room
- **Smithy:** Forge, workbenches, ore processing—actively in use
- **Mine Entrance:** Shaft leading down to iron vein and sealed passages
- **Commander's Tower:** Nargul's quarters, war room, treasury

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Smithy | Present, excellent | Cleaning, duergar removal (50 gp) |
| Armory | Present, stocked | Inventory check (none) |
| Barracks | Present | Cleaning (50 gp) |
| Storehouse | Present | Restocking (100 gp) |
| War Room | Present | Minor repairs (50 gp) |
| Workshop | Space in smithy | Expansion (200 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 400-500 gp (excellent dwarven construction requires minimal work)

**Unique Feature:** The dwarven smithy grants a +1 bonus to crafting checks for metal items. The iron mine, if worked, produces 100 gp/month in ore (requires workers).

## Secrets

1. **The Sealed Horror:** The lower passages contain an **Umber Hulk** that the original dwarves couldn't kill—only trap. It's been dormant but awakens if the seals are disturbed. Intelligent parties can use it against the duergar; foolish ones release a CR 5 problem.

2. **The Deep Vein:** The iron vein continues past the sealed area into a cavern of exceptional ore—enough to make Hammerhall incredibly wealthy. The duergar don't know about it; the original dwarves died before reporting it.

3. **Nargul's Orders:** The duergar commander carries orders from a deeper authority—a duergar city establishing surface footholds across the region. The Iron Redoubt is part of a larger invasion plan. His documents reveal other target locations.

## DM Notes

### Duergar Tactics
Duergar are intelligent and use their abilities well:
- Enlarge/Reduce for combat advantage
- Invisibility for ambushes and escapes
- Prepared fortifications and fallback positions
- The Mind Master interrogates any captives

### The Sealed Horror
The umber hulk is optional—exclude it for simpler play, include it for complication. It could be:
- An ally against the duergar (briefly, chaotically)
- A third faction everyone fights
- A trap the duergar spring on the party

### Campaign Integration
The Iron Redoubt connects to:
- Hammerhall and dwarven politics
- Underdark invasion subplot
- Iron supply for the Eastern March's forges
- Mountain exploration adventures

### Mining Operations
If players want to work the mine, it requires:
- 10 workers minimum (recruit from Hammerhall)
- 50 gp/month operating costs
- Monthly output: 100-150 gp in ore
- Risk of Underdark encounters if lower tunnels aren't sealed
