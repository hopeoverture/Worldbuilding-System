# The Sunken Lighthouse

## Overview

Beacon's Rest once guided ships safely past the treacherous Widow's Teeth—a line of jagged rocks where the coast curves sharply south of [[Porto Valdris]]. Fifty years ago, an earthquake dropped the peninsula into the sea. The lighthouse survived, its base now submerged in 30 feet of water while its upper levels remain above the waves.

The disaster created a unique environment: the flooded lower levels connect to sea caves, while the upper lighthouse still stands intact and accessible by boat. Unfortunately, a tribe of merrow—those corrupted merfolk who serve the dark powers of the deep—claimed the ruins. Their sea hag matriarch, Grandmother Brine, considers the lighthouse her throne and the surrounding waters her kingdom.

Ships still wreck on the Widow's Teeth. Now, instead of rescue, they find only death.

## Current Threat

### Grandmother Brine
**Sea Hag (CR 2)** with legendary actions and lair abilities—effective CR 4. Ancient and cunning, she commands the merrow through fear and dark bargains. She possesses a hag eye that lets her see through the eyes of any merrow in her service.

### The Merrow Tribe
- **Merrow (6):** CR 2 each - The main fighting force
- **Merrow Shallowpriest (1):** CR 4 - Serves as Grandmother's lieutenant

### Enslaved Victims
- **Drowned Zombies (8):** CR 1/4 - Former sailors, serve as laborers
- **Living Captives (3):** Recent shipwreck survivors awaiting sacrifice

### Environmental Hazards
- Lower levels flooded (underwater combat rules)
- Sea caves connect to open ocean (merrow reinforcement route)
- Widow's Teeth visible at low tide (navigation hazard)

### Total Encounter: CR 9-10 (Hard for level 6 party; requires underwater capability)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Clear the Lighthouse (Combat)
Assault the merrow tribe and destroy Grandmother Brine. Key challenges:
- Reaching the lighthouse requires a boat (merrow attack approaching vessels)
- Lower levels require water breathing or underwater combat capability
- Grandmother Brine can escape through sea caves if losing; must be cornered

[[House Valdren]] will grant the lighthouse to whoever restores it as a navigation aid.

### Option 2: Bargain with Grandmother Brine (Diplomacy)
The sea hag wants specific magical items and doesn't care about the lighthouse itself—she wants power. If offered:
- A hag eye focus (rare item from another hag)
- Seven fingerbones of seven different spellcasters
- A promise to deliver a specific enemy to her

She will abandon the lighthouse and take her merrow elsewhere. This leaves her as a future problem but avoids combat.

### Option 3: Merchant Prince Contract (Quest)
The [[Merchant Princes]] of Porto Valdris want the lighthouse restored. They offer:
- Payment for eliminating the merrow threat
- Full ownership of the lighthouse
- Funding for initial repairs (500 gp)

In exchange, the party must maintain the beacon and report on shipping movements—essentially becoming coastguard contractors.

### Option 4: Underwater Alliance (Diplomacy)
Rumors speak of uncorrupted merfolk who oppose the merrow. Finding and allying with them provides:
- Underwater combat support
- Knowledge of sea cave layout
- Potential ongoing alliance for coastal adventures

The merfolk want the lighthouse destroyed (bad memories); the party must negotiate keeping it.

## Location

The Sunken Lighthouse sits on what was once Point Beacon, now reduced to scattered rocks 8 miles south of [[Porto Valdris]]. The Widow's Teeth extend half a mile from the lighthouse, visible only at low tide.

A small cove on the landward side provides sheltered anchorage for a single vessel. The mainland coast, 200 yards away, offers a hidden beach where boats can be secured.

## Physical Description

### Exterior
The lighthouse rises 60 feet above the current waterline, its white-painted stone stained green with algae below the tideline. The beacon mechanism at the top is damaged but potentially repairable. A stone dock at the base is now underwater, accessible only to swimmers.

At low tide, the remnants of the keeper's cottage and outbuildings are visible as rubble-strewn foundations.

### Interior Layout
- **Submerged Levels (0-30 ft depth):** Flooded keeper's quarters, storage, kitchens—now merrow lair
- **Sea Caves:** Connect to deeper ocean; merrow entry/exit point
- **Ground Level (just above water):** Entry vestibule, equipment room
- **Second Level:** Living quarters (damaged, habitable)
- **Third Level:** Library/study (surprisingly intact)
- **Beacon Level:** Lighthouse mechanism (repairable), observation deck

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Observatory | Beacon level, damaged | Repair mechanism (400 gp) |
| Quarters → Pub | Second level, damaged | Renovation (200 gp) |
| Study → Scriptorium | Third level, intact | Furnishing (100 gp) |
| Submerged → Storehouse | Flooded | Seal and pump (500 gp) |
| Dock | Submerged | Raise or build new (300 gp) |
| Armory | Space available | Construction (200 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 1,500-1,700 gp

**Unique Feature:** If the submerged levels are sealed off rather than drained, they can serve as an underwater facility—perfect for housing aquatic allies or accessing the sea caves.

## Secrets

1. **The Old Beacon:** The original lighthouse beacon was magical, not just a flame. Its crystal core lies in Grandmother Brine's hoard. If restored, the beacon can reveal invisible vessels and see through magical fog within 5 miles.

2. **The Sea Cave Vault:** Before the earthquake, the lighthouse keeper hid contraband for smugglers in a cave only accessible at specific tides. The smugglers' cache—1,200 gp in old coins and several bottles of rare wine—remains undiscovered.

3. **The Merfolk Treaty:** Carved into a cave wall is an ancient treaty between the lighthouse keepers and local merfolk. The merfolk promised to guide ships safely; in exchange, the lighthouse never housed weapons of war. Breaking this covenant brought the earthquake (according to merfolk legend).

## DM Notes

### Underwater Combat
This dungeon requires preparation for underwater encounters:
- Water breathing (spell, potion, or magic item)
- Underwater combat rules (disadvantage for non-aquatic creatures with most weapons)
- The merrow have massive advantage in their element

### Tactical Approach
Smart parties might:
- Seal the sea caves first, preventing merrow escape
- Attack at low tide when more of the lighthouse is accessible
- Lure merrow to the surface using bait (a "stranded" ship)
- Use fire/lightning underwater (area denial)

### Campaign Integration
Restoring the lighthouse makes the party valuable to [[House Valdren]] and the Merchant Princes. The beacon's magical properties can serve as a plot device—revealing hidden threats or tracking mysterious ships.

### Grandmother Brine's Escape
If the hag escapes, she becomes a recurring villain with a personal grudge. She'll ally with other hags, create more merrow, and plot elaborate revenge involving the party's ships or coastal allies.
