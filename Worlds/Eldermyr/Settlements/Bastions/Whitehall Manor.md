# Whitehall Manor

## Overview

Whitehall Manor is a graceful estate of pale stone and climbing roses, situated on rolling hills between [[Aldersgate]] and [[Thornhall]]. The Marwyn family has held it for eight generations, known as patrons of the arts and minor players in court politics. To all appearances, Lord Cassian Marwyn is a reclusive scholar mourning his recently deceased father.

The truth is far darker. Lord Cassian was turned into a vampire spawn six months ago by a creature that stalks [[The Crown Lands]]. Unable to resist his new nature, he has been slowly corrupting the household staff into a cult that worships him as divine. The real Lord Cassian—the kind, bookish young noble—is trapped within, desperately trying to signal for help between his monster's demands.

The manor remains beautiful during the day, but at night, terrible things happen in the cellars.

## Current Threat

### Lord Cassian Marwyn
**Vampire Spawn (CR 5)** with levels in scholar/noble—effective CR 6. Cassian fights his nature but cannot resist feeding. He is bound to an unknown vampire master and cannot directly betray them.

### Corrupted Staff
- **Cult Fanatics (4):** CR 2 each - Household leaders turned zealots
- **Cultists (8):** CR 1/8 - Servants who've drunk Cassian's blood
- **Shadows (2):** CR 1/2 - Former servants who died and rose

### The Cellar Prisoners
Three captive villagers await feeding, kept alive for fresh blood.

### Hidden Threat
Cassian's vampire sire visits monthly during the new moon. If confronted during such a visit, add a **Vampire (CR 13)** to the encounter—far beyond a level 5 party.

### Total Encounter: CR 7-8 (Hard for level 5 party without vampire sire)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Destroy Cassian (Combat)
Kill the vampire spawn and his cultists. The manor becomes legally available when no Marwyn heir survives. A party could petition the Crown for ownership, or purchase it at auction (2,000 gp—cheap due to "unfortunate events").

**Note:** This solution is complete but loses potentially valuable information about the master vampire.

### Option 2: Cure Cassian (Quest)
Vampire spawn can theoretically be restored by killing their master. If the party can identify and destroy Cassian's sire:
- Cassian becomes human again
- He grants the party Whitehall in gratitude (he'll retire to a monastery)
- The party gains valuable intelligence about the vampire's activities

**Sire Identity:** The vampire is [[Lady Vesper Thorne]]—a revelation that would shake [[House Thorne]] to its core.

### Option 3: Expose the Cult (Investigation)
Gather evidence of the cult's activities and present it to [[The Church of the Three]]. Church templars assault the manor, destroying Cassian. The Church grants the party the estate as reward for exposing the evil.

This is the easiest path but loses Cassian's knowledge.

### Option 4: Redeem and Rule (Diplomacy/Magic)
If a cleric or paladin can temporarily suppress Cassian's vampiric urges (high-level magic), he might be convinced to:
- Reveal his sire's identity
- Help the party trap the vampire during the next new moon
- Cede the estate to the party while he seeks a permanent cure

This requires creative spellcasting and excellent roleplaying.

## Location

Whitehall Manor lies in the gentle countryside 20 miles east of [[Aldersgate]], near the road to [[Thornhall]]. The estate includes 200 acres of orchards, vineyards, and decorative gardens. The village of Whitehall (pop. 120) provides servants and farmers for the estate.

The location is pleasant and accessible—perfect for a party wanting a civilized base near the capital.

## Physical Description

### Exterior
The manor is built of white limestone with a red tile roof, surrounded by formal gardens. Two wings extend from a central block, creating a courtyard with a fountain. Stables, servant quarters, and a small chapel are separate buildings.

During the day, everything appears normal if slightly neglected. At night, no lights show and strange sounds echo across the grounds.

### Interior Layout
- **Ground Floor:** Grand foyer, ballroom, dining room, kitchens, library
- **Second Floor:** Master suite, guest rooms (8), sitting rooms
- **Third Floor:** Servant quarters, storage
- **Chapel:** Small but ornate, dedicated to [[The Three]]
- **Cellars:** Wine storage, root cellars—and Cassian's hidden prison

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Library | Present, excellent | None (Cassian's collection is valuable) |
| Scriptorium | Present | Minor repairs (50 gp) |
| Chapel/Sanctuary | Present, desecrated | Reconsecration (free with Church help) |
| Garden | Present, overgrown | Restoration (100 gp) |
| Ballroom → Theater | Present | Conversion (300 gp) |
| Guildhall | Space available | Construction (250 gp) |
| Stable | Present | Cleaning, restocking (100 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 500-800 gp

**Unique Feature:** The library contains extensive legal and historical records about [[The Crown Lands]], providing advantage on History checks about the region.

## Secrets

1. **Cassian's Diary:** Hidden behind a false book spine, Cassian's diary documents his transformation, his sire's identity, and his desperate attempts to resist. It also contains partial information about other vampire spawn being created throughout Eldermyr.

2. **The Marwyn Treasury:** Lord Marwyn senior didn't trust banks. The family fortune (3,000 gp) is hidden in a vault beneath the chapel, behind a door that only opens when specific prayers are spoken.

3. **Letters to the Sire:** Correspondence between Cassian and his sire reveals a network of vampire influence reaching into the nobility. These letters could be valuable blackmail—or could make the party powerful enemies.

## Image Prompts

### Art Style
**Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate architectural and environmental detail, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.**

### Exterior View
**Prompt:**
> An elegant white limestone manor house on gentle hills in golden afternoon light. Red tile roof, climbing roses on the walls, formal gardens with hedges and fountains. Two symmetrical wings create a welcoming courtyard. Perfectly respectable aristocratic estate, but with subtle wrongness—overgrown edges, closed shutters, no servants visible. Gothic horror hiding behind pastoral beauty. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, 8K quality.

### Interior - The Library at Night
**Prompt:**
> A grand library in a noble manor at night, lit only by a dying fire. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves of dark wood, leather-bound volumes, a massive desk covered in papers. Long shadows stretch across the room. A pale figure with hollow eyes sits by the fire, elegant but wrong—Lord Cassian caught between humanity and monster. Melancholy Gothic horror atmosphere. Hyper-realistic digital art, intricate detail, dramatic shadows, 8K quality.

## DM Notes

### The Horror Approach
This bastion works best as a slow-burn mystery. The party might visit for legitimate reasons (library research, noble invitation) before realizing something is wrong. Cassian's tragic nature should be apparent—he's a victim, not a monster.

### Vampire Sire Timing
Do NOT have the vampire sire present during the party's first visit unless they specifically time it for the new moon. The sire (CR 13) should be a future threat, not a party-wipe encounter.

### Campaign Integration
Discovering Lady Vesper Thorne is a vampire opens a major political conspiracy. [[House Thorne]] is the military backbone of Eldermyr—a vampire in their midst is catastrophic. The party gains powerful enemies but also potential allies among Thorne's enemies.

### Cassian's Fate
If cured, Cassian becomes an NPC ally with extensive knowledge of nobility, law, and vampire operations. If killed, his diary still provides critical intelligence but without his personal insights.
