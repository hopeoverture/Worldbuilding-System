# Wyrmbone Spire

## Overview

High in [[The Greycrowns]], where the air thins and snow falls year-round, a natural stone spire rises 200 feet above a mountain plateau. Ancient peoples carved chambers into the rock; later inhabitants expanded them. For the past century, however, Wyrmbone Spire has belonged to dragons.

The current occupant is Frostclaw, a young white dragon who claimed the lair after killing its previous occupant—her own mother. Frostclaw is ambitious, cruel, and paranoid. She commands a tribe of fanatically loyal kobolds who worship her as a goddess. From her lair, she raids the lowlands, collecting treasure and terrorizing the goliath tribes of [[The Greycrowns]].

The goliaths have offered great rewards to anyone who can slay or drive off the wyrm. [[House Thorne]] would pay handsomely for a stronghold controlling the mountain passes. And legends speak of treasure accumulated over centuries of dragon occupation.

## Current Threat

### Frostclaw
**Young White Dragon (CR 6)** with additional HP and a cunning nature—effective CR 7. Unlike typical white dragons, Frostclaw is intelligent and uses her lair to maximum advantage. She's killed adventuring parties before.

**Lair Actions:** Freezing fog, ice walls, collapsing snow from ceiling (per white dragon lair actions).

### The Frost Fang Tribe
- **Kobold Scale Sorcerer (1):** CR 1 - Frostclaw's high priest, magical support
- **Winged Kobolds (6):** CR 1/4 - Scouts and messengers
- **Kobold Dragonshields (8):** CR 1 - Elite guards armed with ice-treated weapons
- **Kobolds (30+):** CR 1/8 - Workers, trappers, meat shields

### Lair Defenses
- Trapped approaches (deadfalls, pit traps, alarm systems)
- Frozen sentries (kobolds in hidden positions)
- Narrow passages that favor small creatures
- A choke point where Frostclaw can use breath weapon effectively

### Total Encounter: CR 10-12 (Deadly for level 9 party; lair advantage significant)

## How to Earn This Bastion

### Option 1: Slay the Dragon (Combat)
The classic approach—kill Frostclaw and scatter her kobolds. Challenges:
- Reaching the spire requires mountain climbing or flight
- The kobolds set ambushes on the approach
- Frostclaw knows her lair perfectly and uses hit-and-run tactics
- She has an escape route if the battle turns

**Reward:** The lair, its treasure, and eternal gratitude from the goliaths. Dragon parts are valuable for crafting.

### Option 2: Challenge of Champions (Honor)
Goliath tradition allows for single combat challenges. If a party member can convince Frostclaw her honor demands accepting a duel:
- One-on-one combat with the dragon
- The winner claims the spire
- Frostclaw's pride might accept (DC 20 Persuasion with appropriate framing)

This is incredibly dangerous but potentially avoids a full encounter with the kobold army.

### Option 3: Drive Her Out (Cunning)
Frostclaw is young and paranoid about older dragons. If the party can:
- Fake evidence of an older dragon approaching
- Recruit a dragon ally to threaten her territory
- Use illusion magic to simulate a superior threat

She might abandon the lair rather than fight. This leaves her as a future enemy but avoids direct combat.

### Option 4: The Kobold Uprising (Intrigue)
Not all kobolds love their "goddess." The previous high priest, now demoted, would support a coup if he could survive it. The party could:
- Contact the disgraced priest secretly
- Arm a kobold faction
- Trigger an internal revolt during their assault

This reduces the threat level significantly and might gain kobold servants for the bastion.

## Location

Wyrmbone Spire stands at 12,000 feet elevation in the central [[Greycrowns]], accessible only by treacherous mountain paths or flight. The nearest settlement is a goliath camp 15 miles distant. [[Grimhold]] lies 50 miles to the east.

The spire guards a pass between two peaks, controlling a secondary route through the mountains.

## Physical Description

### Exterior
The spire is a natural stone formation carved by wind and ice into a dramatic finger of rock. Its surface is sheer except where the ancient builders carved ledges, stairs, and platforms. Ice coats everything. The main entrance is 80 feet up, accessible by a carved staircase or flight.

Bones of large creatures litter the plateau below—Frostclaw's dining area.

### Interior Layout
- **Lower Caves:** Natural caverns, kobold warrens, storage
- **Mid Levels:** Carved chambers, barracks, kitchens, the "temple" to Frostclaw
- **Upper Chambers:** Former dragon's sleeping area, trapped corridors
- **Summit Chamber:** Frostclaw's lair, treasure hoard, best defensive position
- **Secret Passages:** Multiple, known only to the kobold priest

## Potential Facilities

| Facility | Existing Condition | Renovation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Treasury | Present (hoard chamber) | Secure storage conversion (100 gp) |
| Summit → Observatory | Accessible | Weather protection, instruments (400 gp) |
| Lower Caves → Menagerie | Present | Conversion, fencing (350 gp) |
| Large Cavern → Training Area | Present | Clearing, equipment (200 gp) |
| Armory | Space available | Construction (250 gp) |
| Temple → Arcane Study | Present | Conversion, purification (300 gp) |

**Total Renovation Cost:** 1,400-1,600 gp

**Unique Feature:** The summit provides unparalleled views of [[The Greycrowns]]. An observatory here grants advantage on navigation checks and can spot movement within 20 miles on clear days. The cold environment naturally preserves anything stored here.

## Secrets

1. **The Ancient Builders:** The spire was carved by a pre-human civilization. Hidden chambers sealed before the dragons came contain artifacts and records of this lost people. Value: historical and potentially magical.

2. **Frostclaw's Egg:** Unknown to all but Frostclaw herself, she has laid an egg hidden in a secret ice chamber. She'd die to protect it. A party that discovers and threatens the egg has ultimate leverage—or a future dragon enemy if they destroy it.

3. **The Crystal Heart:** Deep in the spire's natural stone lies a massive crystal that radiates cold. It's why dragons favor this lair. Properly extracted, it could power magical items or serve as a component for legendary crafting. Improperly handled, it explodes in a 100-foot burst of freezing death.

## DM Notes

### Dragon Combat
Frostclaw is smart for a white dragon. She:
- Uses lair actions aggressively
- Retreats through tight passages to catch breath (literally)
- Focuses breath weapon on clustered enemies
- Sends kobolds to die while she repositions
- Flees if reduced to 25% HP (through secret exit)

### The Egg Complication
If the party discovers the egg, Frostclaw becomes even more dangerous—and potentially negotiable:
- Threaten the egg: She'll bargain (but never truly forgive)
- Destroy the egg: She fights to the death, enraged
- Protect the egg: Confuses her; possible strange alliance?

### Campaign Integration
Wyrmbone Spire offers:
- Strategic control of a mountain pass
- Alliance with goliath tribes
- Dragon-related crafting materials
- A base for Greycrown exploration
- Potential kobold servants (if coup path taken)

### Treasure Hoard
Frostclaw's hoard contains:
- 3,000 gp in coins
- 1,500 gp in gems
- 5 pieces of fine jewelry (200 gp each)
- 1 rare magic item (DM's choice)
- 2 uncommon magic items
- Dragon scales and teeth (crafting materials, 500 gp value)
