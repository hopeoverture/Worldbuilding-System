# Chernogrod

## Overview
Chernogrod is a city in mourning—for its dead, for its past glory, and perhaps for its future. Once the proud seat of a great house, it now huddles behind black stone walls, defiant against a realm that crushed it and a curse that creeps ever closer from [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]. Here, [[Lord Draven Karath]] nurses his hatred in the Black Keep, making bargains with powers that no sane man would acknowledge. The city's people endure because endurance is all they have left—and because something is growing in the darkness beneath their lord's fortress.

## Geography

### Location
Chernogrod sits on a rise of black granite overlooking the lower Chorna River, some thirty miles from [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]. The location was chosen centuries ago for its defensive position; the black stone that gives the city its name provides both building material and psychological weight. To the south, the Bitter Coast offers the only reliable trade route since the land routes became dangerous.

### Terrain
The city occupies a natural defensive position—a granite outcrop rising from the scarred farmland. The Chorna River (running increasingly gray as it passes the Fields upstream) provides water, though it's no longer safe to drink without boiling. The surrounding countryside is blighted—dead orchards, abandoned farms, fields that produce less each year.

### Climate
Temperate, but wrong. The seasons still turn, but spring brings no renewal near the curse. Mist rises from the Fields and drifts south; the sun seems perpetually dim; crops wither even with adequate rain. The locals say [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] are exhaling, and Chernogrod breathes the same air.

## Layout

### The Black Walls
Chernogrod's walls are built from the local black granite, giving the city its name. They're old, weathered, but sound—[[House Karath]] has maintained them even when they couldn't maintain hope. Three gates pierce the walls, though the northern gate has been sealed since the curse began spreading.

### The Districts
The city is smaller than it was—whole neighborhoods abandoned as population fell, reclaimed by nature or dismantled for materials. What remains clusters around the Black Keep and the southern waterfront.

**The Keep Quarter:** The area immediately around the Black Keep, home to what remains of the nobility and those who serve [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] directly.

**The Living City:** The central districts where most inhabitants cling to existence—markets, temples, workshops that still function.

**The Docks:** The southern waterfront, the city's lifeline to the outside world. Fishing boats and the occasional merchant vessel provide food and trade.

**The Abandoned Quarter:** The northern and eastern sections, too close to the curse's spread, now empty save for scavengers and worse.

## The Black Keep

### Structure
The fortress of [[House Karath]] is carved from the same black granite as the walls, rising in stark towers above the city. Unlike the refined palaces of other great houses, this is a fortress pure and simple—built for war, maintained through defeat, now humming with something darker.

### What's Changed
The lower levels have been sealed. Strange sounds echo at night. The servants whisper about lights in windows that should be dark. [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] spends hours in chambers no one else may enter. His sister [[Yelena Karath]] comes and goes through passages that don't appear on any map.

### The Catacombs
Beneath the Keep, ancient tunnels extend into the rock. The Karath family buried their dead here for centuries. Recently, [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] has been... renovating.

## Demographics

### Population Collapse
**Current Population:** ~35,000 (down from 60,000 before [[The Great War]], 400,000 in [[The Karath Reach]] overall)
**Trend:** Still declining—those who can leave, do

### Who Remains
- The loyal—those who share Karath hatred of the other houses
- The trapped—those too poor, too old, or too sick to flee
- The faithful—those who still believe [[House Karath]] will rise again
- The changed—those who have spent too much time near the Fields

### Social Classes
Class distinctions have collapsed. Everyone is poor; everyone is desperate; everyone is bound by shared trauma. The noble families either fled after the war or threw in their lot with [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s cause. The distinction that matters now is loyalty—to [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]], to the house, to the dream of vengeance.

## Government

### [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]]'s Rule
[[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] Karath rules absolutely. There is no council, no advisors with independent power, no check on his authority. He is the law. His word is final. Those who question him disappear—to prison, to exile, or to [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]].

### The Inner Circle
Only two people have [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s ear:
- **[[Yelena Karath]]** — His sister, the Lady of Whispers, who manages intelligence and dark works
- **Ser Mikhail Volkov** — Captain of the Guard, childhood friend, the only person [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] trusts with a weapon

### The Tribute
Theoretically, [[House Karath]] pays tribute to the crown and to the houses that defeated them. [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] stopped paying six months ago. No one has come to collect—yet.

## Economy

### Survival
The primary industry of Chernogrod is not dying. The surrounding farms produce less each year as the blight spreads. The fishing boats bring in what they can from the Bitter Coast. Salvage from abandoned villages provides materials. And increasingly, darker trades sustain those willing to deal with what lurks in the night.

### Trade
**Exports:** Little of value—some fish, some salvage, rumors
**Imports:** Grain (desperately needed), medicine, hope (not available)

The city survives on dwindling reserves and the grim determination of its people. How long this can continue is measured in months, not years.

### The Black Market
Things are traded in Chernogrod that can't be traded elsewhere—forbidden texts, cursed relics, the services of those who have... changed. The authorities don't interfere. In some cases, they're the ones trading.

## Religion

### [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] Strained
The Cathedral of Sorrows still stands, still holds services, still offers what comfort faith can provide. But the priests struggle to explain why [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] permitted such suffering, why the dead will not rest, why prayers seem to go unanswered.

### Rising Alternatives
Some have turned to the Old Ways—ancestor veneration, land spirits, traditions [[The Faith of the Three]] suppressed. Others whisper of a power that answers when [[The Faith of the Three]] are silent. The Ash Penitents have appeared—flagellants who believe the curse is divine punishment for the realm's sins.

### Father Petrov
The High Priest of the Cathedral, struggling to hold his flock's faith together while privately wondering if [[The Faith of the Three]] have abandoned [[The Karath Reach]] entirely.

## Notable Locations

### The Black Keep
[[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]]'s fortress, seat of [[House Karath]], and increasingly the heart of something dark. The upper levels function normally; the lower levels are sealed; the catacombs echo with sounds that shouldn't exist.

### The Cathedral of Sorrows
The largest temple in the city, its onion domes visible from the harbor. Packed with worshippers praying for deliverance. The priests do what they can. It's not enough.

### The Grudge Stone
A great black stone in the central square where wrongs are carved to never be forgotten. The stone is nearly full—generations of grievances inscribed in tight script. Recently, someone carved new names: every lord who voted for Karath's punishment after [[The Great War|the Great War]].

### The Northern Gate
Sealed and bricked up. On the other side, the abandoned quarter stretches toward the curse. Sometimes, at night, something knocks from the outside.

### The Docks of the Living
The southern waterfront, where fishing boats and occasional traders provide the city's lifeline. The dock-workers are pragmatic—they'll trade with anyone, ask no questions, and never sail north.

### The Mourning Ground
Where the Mourning Women gather to sing the laments, keeping alive the names of the dead. Recently, the songs have changed—less grief, more... anticipation.

## Key Figures

### [[Lord Draven Karath]]
*See [[Lord Draven Karath]]*
The broken lord, consumed by vengeance, making bargains no sane man would accept. He was a boy when his family was destroyed. He has had twenty years to nurse his hatred. Now he has power—power that feeds on the thirty thousand dead.

### [[Yelena Karath]]
*See [[Yelena Karath]]*
[[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s sister, deeper into the darkness than even he knows. She sees through [[Yelena Karath|the Watcher's Eye]], walks in dreams, and communes with something that shouldn't be named.

### Lady Mira Karath
[[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s wife, dead in childbirth—but her memory haunts the Keep. Some say [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] speaks to her portrait. Others say she speaks back.

### [[Aleksei Karath]]
[[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s son, twelve years old, increasingly frightened by what his father has become. His aunt [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] is "teaching" him things. He has nightmares about a figure in a crown of blackened iron.

### Ser Mikhail Volkov
Captain of the Guard, [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s only true friend. He knows his lord is descending into something terrible. He stays because he remembers the boy [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] was, and because someone has to protect young [[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]].

### Old Yeva
A hedge witch who remembers the Old Ways. [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] tolerates her because she heals the sick and comforts the dying. She fears what's stirring in the catacombs but can't bring herself to flee.

## Secrets

1. **The Catacombs are awake.** The Karath dead are stirring in their tombs. [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] visits them. They speak to him. They're angry.

2. **Lady Mira's portrait bleeds.** On certain nights, the portrait weeps blood. [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]] has made it part of his rituals. [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]] knows it's not his wife speaking through the canvas.

3. **The changed guard the walls.** Some of Chernogrod's soldiers have been... altered by exposure to the Fields. They don't eat. They don't sleep. They obey without question. Ser Mikhail is horrified but can't stop it.

4. **Lady Mira still lives.** She faked her death to escape [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s growing madness. She's in [[Porto Valdris]] under a false name, corresponding with [[Lord Varic Valdren]]. She'll betray everything if it saves her son.

5. **[[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]] can hear the dead.** The boy has inherited something—or been given it. When he sleeps, he visits [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]. The dead are teaching him. He doesn't understand what he's learning.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Lady's Escape:** Lady Mira (secretly alive) needs trusted agents to extract her son from Chernogrod before [[Yelena Karath|Yelena]]'s "lessons" consume him completely.

2. **The Watcher's Warning:** A figure in a grey cloak (a Grey Warden undercover) needs help gathering evidence of [[Lord Draven Karath|Draven]]'s dark dealings—evidence that could justify intervention.

3. **The Mourning Women:** Their songs have changed. They're singing something new—coordinates, perhaps, or instructions. Someone needs to find out what and why.

4. **The Old Ways:** Old Yeva knows rituals that might protect against the curse—but she needs materials from the heart of [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]].

5. **[[Aleksei Karath|Aleksei]]'s Dreams:** The boy reaches out in dreams to someone outside the city. He's terrified. He's powerful. He needs help before he becomes what his aunt is making.

### Exterior (Wide Shot)
**Prompt:**
Wide establishing shot of Chernogrod at dusk, the Black City that refuses to die though it has been dying for twenty-three years. A fortress-city of black granite rising from blighted, gray-brown farmland that stretches to a sickly horizon. The distinctive onion domes of the Cathedral of Sorrows gleam dully beneath iron-gray clouds—gold leaf tarnished, copper green with age—alongside the stark, angular towers of the Black Keep which looms over the city like a watchful predator. Massive black stone walls encircle the settlement, their construction brutal and unadorned, built from the same granite that gives the city its name. The northern gate is visibly bricked up with newer, paler stone—sealed against what creeps down from the Ashen Fields thirty miles away. The Chorna River runs gray and sluggish beside the city, its waters thick with ash carried downstream from the cursed lands. Entire districts of the city stand abandoned, visible as darker sections where roofs have collapsed and windows stare like empty eyes. Mist drifts from the north in slow, creeping tendrils, carrying the faint smell of grave earth and old death. Few lights burn in the windows that remain inhabited—candles and torches, not warmth. A fishing boat returns to the southern docks, the only movement in a scene of suspended despair. The atmosphere is of a city that has not died but remembers what living felt like, nursing its grievances and its hatred in equal measure.

### The Grudge Stone
**Prompt:**
Street-level view of the central square of Chernogrod, dominated by the Grudge Stone—a massive monolith of black granite standing fifteen feet tall, its entire surface carved with generations of grievances. The script is layered tight upon itself, newer carvings cutting through older ones, names and wrongs and oaths of vengeance inscribed in multiple hands and multiple eras. Fresh carvings are visible near the base—someone has recently added the names of every lord who voted for House Karath's punishment after the Great War. The surrounding buildings are constructed of the same black stone, their architecture distinctively eastern with onion domes and pointed arches, windows dark or covered with black cloth. A few gaunt citizens in dark mourning clothing move through the square, their faces hollow with hardship, their eyes burning with something between despair and determination. The Mourning Women gather at the stone's base—a dozen figures in heavy black veils, their voices raised in haunting lament that echoes off the stone walls. The Cathedral of Sorrows looms in the background, its bells silent though the hour has struck, the great bronze instruments having not rung in years. No merchants cry their wares. No children play. The only sound is the keening of the women and the distant cry of ravens. The atmosphere is oppressive, grief-laden, but shot through with defiant rage—this city has not forgotten what was done to it, and the stone remembers every wrong.

### The Black Keep at Night
**Prompt:**
The Black Keep of Chernogrod at midnight, seat of House Karath and lair of Lord Draven's dark workings. The fortress rises in stark angular towers of black granite against a starless sky, its architecture brutal and uncompromising—this is not a palace but a declaration of war made permanent in stone. Lights burn in only a few windows, and in the highest tower, something pulses with a faint red-purple glow that has no natural source. The lower levels are dark, their windows sealed and barred—the chambers where Lord Draven conducts rituals no sane man would acknowledge. Torches gutter along the walls, their flames bent by winds that blow from no discernible direction. Guards in black and purple patrol the battlements, but their movements are too regular, too mechanical—the Changed, those soldiers altered by exposure to the Ashen Fields, who no longer need to eat or sleep. The keep's shadow falls across the city below, darker than it should be, as if the building drinks in what little light exists. Somewhere within, something is being done that violates the natural order. The atmosphere of ancient power corrupted, of a noble house descending into something monstrous to reclaim what was taken from it.
