# Coldwater

## Overview
Coldwater clings to the last hospitable shelf before [[The Greycrowns]] rise into impassable heights—a frontier town where the lowland roads end and mountain trails begin. Here, merchants transfer goods to mule trains, miners provision their expeditions, and travelers hire guides before attempting [[The Iron Gate Pass]]. The icy stream that gives the town its name flows year-round from glacial melt, cold enough to stop the heart.

## Geography

### Location
Coldwater sits at 4,500 feet elevation where [[The Kingswater River]] becomes the Coldwater Stream—too rocky and rapid for boats, marking the practical end of river trade. The town occupies a natural shelf backed by cliffs, with the only wagon-passable road climbing toward [[The Iron Gate Pass]] twenty miles east. [[Thornholt]] lies sixty miles northwest through the foothills.

### Climate
Alpine climate with short, cool summers and long, brutal winters. Snow falls eight months of the year at this elevation, and the trade season runs only from late spring to early autumn. Winter residents are hardy folk who maintain the town while awaiting the spring thaw.

### Layout
The town stretches along a single main street—Trade Road—which is the final leg of the wagon route before it becomes mountain trail. Stone warehouses cluster at the western "Lowside" where wagons arrive; the eastern "Highside" holds outfitters and guide services. The Coldwater Stream runs through the center, crossed by three stone bridges.

**Districts/Quarters:**
1. Lowside — Warehouses, wagon yards, merchant offices
2. Highside — Outfitters, guides, mountain folk housing
3. Cliffside — Miners' quarter, carved partially into the rock

## Demographics

### Population
**Total Population:** 1,800 permanent; swells to 3,000+ during trade season

**Breakdown:**
- Permanent residents: 1,200
- Seasonal merchants and workers: 600+
- Miners and expeditioners (transient): Variable

### Races & Cultures
Primarily human with significant dwarf presence (15%) drawn by proximity to [[The Deep Delving]] and mountain mining. Occasional goliath traders from the higher peaks. The culture blends lowland practicality with mountain hardiness.

### Social Classes
Mountain traders and successful outfitters at the top; skilled guides and craftsmen in the middle; seasonal laborers and fortune-seeking miners at the bottom. Success measured by how well you survive winters.

## Government & Politics

### Current Leadership
**Title & Name:** Master Trader Katya Stoneheart
**In Power Since:** 12 years
**Reputation:** Fair dealer, iron will, survived six avalanches
**Current Priorities:** Keeping the pass open amid the succession crisis; managing increased military traffic

### Town Council/Advisors
1. Guide Master Bjorn — Represents the Mountain Guides Guild
2. Warehouse Master Pavel — Controls goods storage
3. Mine Factor Dagna Ironvein — Dwarf representative; mining interests
4. Father Aldric — Temple of the Mountain Father

### Political Factions
1. **Pass Keepers:** Want neutrality; profit from all sides
2. **Thorne Sympathizers:** Military traffic from Thornholt is profitable
3. **Free Traders:** Resent any noble interference in mountain commerce

### Outside Authority
Technically owes allegiance to [[House Thorne]] through proximity, but isolation makes this largely theoretical. The mountain folk govern themselves and pay lip service to whichever lord sends tax collectors.

## Economy

### Primary Industry
**Industry:** Mountain trade and supply
**Description:** Coldwater exists to transfer goods between wagon and mule train; every item bound for the eastern frontier passes through here
**Key Players:** Master Trader Stoneheart controls the Transfer Exchange
**Seasonal Patterns:** Frantic activity spring-autumn; quiet survival in winter

### Secondary Industries
1. Fur trade — Mountain trappers bring pelts here
2. Mining supplies — Outfitting prospectors and mining operations
3. Guide services — No one crosses the pass without local knowledge

### Trade & Commerce
- End of the wagon road; beginning of the trail network
- Exports: Furs, mountain herbs, iron ore, expedition guides
- Imports: Everything the mountains don't provide—grain, cloth, tools, luxuries
- Trade season runs five months; winter trade limited to emergency supplies

### Guilds & Organizations
| Guild/Organization | Focus | Influence |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Mountain Guides Guild | Safe passage services | High |
| Traders' Exchange | Goods transfer and storage | High |
| Prospectors' Union | Mining rights and support | Medium |
| Furriers' Lodge | Pelt trade | Medium |

### Wealth & Prices
**Overall Wealth:** Comfortable (good income, harsh conditions)
**Price Levels:** Expensive (everything must be hauled uphill)

## Culture & Religion

### Character
Coldwater feels like civilization's last outpost—sturdy stone buildings braced against the wind, people who measure words carefully, and a frontier pragmatism that respects competence over birth. Everyone here has stories of the mountains; the foolish ones are dead.

### Traditions
1. First Thaw Festival — Celebrating the opening of the trade season
2. The Counting — Autumn accounting of who will winter over
3. Mountain's Mercy — Leaving supplies at waypoints for lost travelers
4. The Cold Oath — Binding trade agreements sealed in glacial water

### Religion
The Mountain Father (aspect of the Old Faith) dominates—a stern deity of endurance and stone. The temple is carved into the cliff face. Secondary worship of the New Faith exists among lowland merchants, but locals find it too soft for mountain life.

## Defense & Security

### Town Watch/Guard
- 40 town watch (year-round)
- 40 militia (trade season reinforcement)
- Professional, practical, experienced in mountain combat
- Captain Yuri Coldborn commands

### Fortifications
- Stone walls on three sides; cliff face on the fourth
- Two gates: Western Gate (wagon road) and Eastern Gate (mountain trail)
- The cliff-carved Refuge can hold all residents during siege
- Natural defenses of terrain exceed any wall

### Threats
- Mountain predators (winter wolves, wyverns, occasional giants)
- Avalanche and rockslide
- Bandits preying on trade caravans
- Whatever stirs in [[The Deep Delving]]

## History

### Founding
Coldwater began 400 years ago as a waystation for dwarf traders from [[The Deep Delving]]. When that hold sealed itself, the humans who'd settled to trade with it remained, and the town grew into the mountain's gateway.

### Significant Events
1. The Sealing (200 years ago) — [[The Deep Delving]] closed; Coldwater nearly died
2. Discovery of the southern fur routes — Saved the town's economy
3. The White Winter (50 years ago) — Town cut off for 8 months; 40% died
4. Current crisis — Military movement through the pass strains resources

### Current Era
Coldwater finds itself strategically important as both Thorne and royal forces move troops through [[The Iron Gate Pass]]. Master Trader Stoneheart walks a careful line, providing services to all while favoring none—but pressure mounts to choose a side.
