# Corvana

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a city, create a complex urban center that serves as a major hub of power, commerce, culture, or religion. Cities should have distinct districts, layered social structures, competing factions, and rich history.

## Overview
Corvana is liquid gold made manifest—a city of white-washed walls, gilded domes, and terracotta roofs cascading down the slopes of Valdros Island to the finest natural harbor in Eldermyr. For three centuries, [[House Valdren]] has ruled from the Gilded Palace above the Golden Harbor, building a mercantile empire that rivals kingdoms. Every coin that flows through Eldermyr's western trade passes through Corvana's counting houses; every ship that sails [[The Trader's Sea]] knows her docks. In the succession crisis, Corvana has become House Valdren's impregnable stronghold—wealthy enough to fund armies, defended enough to resist any siege, and ambitious enough to reach for the crown itself.

## Geography

### Location
Corvana sprawls across the southeastern face of Valdros Island, the largest of [[The Valdren Isles]]. The city climbs from the harbor in terraced levels, each providing views across the Merchant's Basin to the other islands of the archipelago. Mount Valdros rises behind the city, its slopes covered in olive groves and noble estates. The Golden Harbor's deep water and natural breakwater make it the safest port in the Trader's Sea.

### Climate
Mediterranean warmth blesses Corvana year-round. Summers are hot and dry, cooled by sea breezes; winters are mild with occasional rains. The city rarely sees frost, and snow is legendary. Salt air permeates everything, and the westerly winds carry the smell of the open sea.

### Layout
Corvana is built in terraces following the hillside's contour. The harbor forms the base, with the Merchant Quarter above it, then residential districts, and finally the Gilded Palace crowning the heights. Winding streets switchback up the slope, connected by countless stairs. The main thoroughfare, the Golden Way, climbs from the harbor gate straight to the palace.

**City Map Overview:**
The Golden Harbor dominates the waterfront with its famous gilded lighthouse. Above it, the Merchant Quarter hosts the trading houses and exchanges. The Temple of Fortune occupies a promontory with views in all directions. Residential terraces climb the hillside, growing wealthier with elevation. The Gilded Palace and its gardens crown the summit.

## Culture & Society

### City Character
Corvana gleams with wealth and ambition. Everything is for sale; everyone has a price; all transactions are negotiable. The islanders are proud, shrewd, and convinced of their superiority to "dustwalkers" (mainlanders). Hospitality is extended to profitable guests; others find the city cold. Success is celebrated openly; failure is hidden or exiled.

### Social Customs
1. Business is personal—insult a deal, insult the family
2. Display wealth openly (hiding money is suspicious)
3. Seal agreements with shared wine, never water
4. Never discuss debts in public

### Traditions & Festivals

### Arts & Entertainment

- Guild apprenticeships

### Food & Drink
- Fresh seafood dominates (octopus, fish, shellfish)
- Olive oil in everything
- Famous wines from Wineisle
- Foreign delicacies available for price
- "Teeth Wine" from Shepherd's Teeth hills

## Defense & Military

### City Watch
- Harbor Watch (1,500; naval-trained)
- Palace Guard (500; elite)
- Professional and well-equipped
- Harbor security prioritized
- Commander: Captain of the Watch

### City Walls & Fortifications
- Sea walls protecting the harbor
- Clifftop natural defenses on landward side
- The Gilded Citadel above the palace

**Magical Defenses:** Harbor ward stones; details classified
**Naval Forces:** The Golden Fleet (40+ warships)
**Siege Equipment:** Ship-mounted; fortress artillery

### Defense Strategy
The islands are nearly impregnable. Any attacker must cross water under fire from the fleet. The harbor can be chained closed. Food stores can last months if grain supplies are secured. The greatest vulnerability is exactly that: grain must be imported.

### Threats
- Grain supply disruption (existential)
- Overextension in mainland war
- Banking families' disloyalty
- Pirate raids (manageable)
- Internal Valdren family conflict

## History

### Ancient History
The islands were fishing camps and pirate refuges before the Valdren purchase. Pre-human ruins dot the southern islets, their purpose unknown. The natural harbor attracted sailors since time immemorial.

### Founding
300 years ago, the Valdren family—then wealthy mainland merchants—purchased exclusive rights to the islands from a cash-strapped crown. Within a generation, they had transformed a backwater into the trading capital of the west.

### Major Historical Periods
**The Purchase Era (300-250 years ago):** Initial development and fortification
**The Banking Era (250-150 years ago):** Establishment of financial dominance
**The Golden Age (150-50 years ago):** Peak prosperity and influence
**The Ambitious Era (current):** Reach for the crown itself

### Significant Events
1. The Valdren Purchase (300 years ago)
2. The Failed Siege (180 years ago; crown's attempt to retake islands)
3. The Banking Charter (150 years ago; Goldport established)
4. The Pirate King's Raid (120 years ago; sacked Saltholm)
5. Death of King Aldric III (recent; succession crisis begins)
6. The Blockade begins (current)

### Current Era
House Valdren has thrown its wealth and power behind a claimant to the throne. The Golden Fleet blockades [[The Silvermere]], strangling [[Eldoria]]'s trade. Corvana thrums with war preparation—ships being built, marines being trained, gold being spent. The Marquis believes this is the Valdren moment; others worry about overreach.

- Piracy (licensed; deniable)
- Black market (managed competition with Exchange)
- Information trading (profitable and protected)
- Assassination (available but expensive)

### Law Enforcement Response
Crime is managed, not eliminated. Certain activities are tolerated; others are crushed. The Harbor Watch maintains order; the Valdren intelligence network handles the rest. Organized crime survives by being useful.

## Secrets

1. The Valdren fortune began with piracy—the "purchase" money came from a captured treasure fleet; the family maintains covert ties to pirates to this day
2. Lady Serena Valdren is secretly negotiating with [[Lord Castellan Maren Ashford]] behind her husband's back, believing the war will destroy the family
3. The Founder's Vault contains a pre-human artifact that the first Valdren retrieved from underwater ruins—an artifact that may be connected to whatever stirs in [[The Silvermere]]
4. Goldmaster Lucio is dying; his choice of successor will reshape island power
5. Captain Rennard Valdren has independent ambitions—if the Marquis's heirs fall, he's positioned to claim power

## Plot Hooks

1. The party is hired to break the blockade from the inside—find a way to get vital supplies to Eldoria
2. Lady Serena secretly contacts the party; she needs documents retrieved from the Founder's Vault without her husband knowing
3. A ship arrives from beyond the western horizon with cargo that terrifies Ambassador Silk—what is it, and why?
4. The Accountant offers the party a job: investigate who's skimming from the black market. The answer involves Valdren family
5. Something ancient stirs in the pre-human ruins beneath the southern isles; fishermen are disappearing
6. Goldmaster Lucio summons the party privately—he needs one last task before he dies, and it involves old debts
7. A Valdren ship captures a vessel carrying a passenger who claims to be the legitimate heir to Eldermyr's throne
8. The Privateer Network has gone rogue; someone must bring them to heel without revealing Valdren connections

## Rumors & Gossip

1. "The Marquis has made a deal with something in the sea caves for victory in the war." (Partially True—negotiations occurred; no deal yet)
2. "Lady Serena and Captain Rennard are lovers." (False—they despise each other)
3. "Goldmaster Lucio keeps a dragon's egg in his personal vault." (False—but he does have something unusual)
4. "The Golden Fleet lost three ships to something in the open sea last month." (True—covered up; cause unknown)

## Notes
Corvana is the counterweight to Eldoria—where the capital represents traditional royal power, Corvana represents mercantile ambition and wealth. The city should feel prosperous, proud, and slightly alien to mainlanders. Adventures here involve trade, intrigue, naval action, and the secrets that wealth can hide.
