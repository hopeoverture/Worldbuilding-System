# Crossford

## Overview
Where the King's Road meets the Northern Way and the Ash Road, Crossford has grown from a simple river crossing into the realm's busiest market town. Four great trade routes converge here, bringing merchants from every corner of Eldermyr. The seasonal fairs draw buyers and sellers from across the realm; the permanent markets never close. Now, with the Ash Road increasingly dangerous and political tensions rising, Crossford finds itself the uneasy meeting point for factions that would rather not meet at all.

## Geography

### Location
Crossford sits where the Kingswater River can be forded (now bridged), at the junction of three major roads:
- **The King's Road:** East-west, connecting [[Stahlburg]] to [[Porto Valdris]] through [[Aldersgate]]
- **The Northern Way:** North to Vindrheim and [[The Northlands|the Northlands]]
- **The Ash Road:** South to [[Chernogrod]] and [[The Karath Reach|the Karath Reach]] (increasingly abandoned)

### The Bridges
Three great bridges span the Kingswater here—the Stone Bridge (oldest), the King's Bridge (largest), and the New Bridge (newest, still called new after fifty years).

### Layout
The town spreads across both banks, connected by bridges. Markets dominate the central areas; warehouses line the waterfront; inns and taverns cluster near the road junctions.

## Districts

### Market Square
The vast central plaza where daily trading occurs. Permanent stalls line the edges; temporary markets fill the center. On fair days, ten thousand people pack the square.

### Bridge Quarter
Between the bridges, housing the most valuable real estate—prime locations for merchants and moneychangers.

### The Roadwards
Four districts extending along each major road, each taking on the character of the region it connects to.

### Riverside
Warehouses, loading docks, and the establishments serving river traffic.

## Economy

### Trade Hub
Everything passes through Crossford. Grain from [[The Crown Lands]], iron from the East, wine from the West, timber from [[The Northlands]], and—once—produce from the South. Merchants meet, deals are struck, goods change hands.

### The Great Fairs
Four times yearly, the Great Fairs draw crowds from across the realm. Each is themed:
- **Spring Fair:** Livestock and agricultural goods
- **Summer Fair:** Crafts and manufactures
- **Autumn Fair:** Harvest bounty and preserved goods
- **Winter Fair:** Luxury goods and entertainment

### Current Crisis
The Ash Road's decline has cut off southern trade. Refugees from [[The Karath Reach|the Karath Reach]] pass through, bringing tales of horror. Merchants are nervous; prices are volatile; the town's prosperity feels fragile.

## Notable Locations

### The Merchant's Hall
Where the Burgher Council meets and major deals are witnessed. A neutral ground where even enemies can negotiate.

### The Four Corners
A famous inn at the exact junction of the roads, claiming to serve travelers from all four directions equally. Its common room has hosted secret negotiations between all the major factions.

### The Stone Bridge
The oldest crossing, now reserved for pedestrians and ceremonial processions. Tradition says bargains struck on the bridge can never be broken.

### The Ash Gate
The southern gate, once the busiest entrance. Now it's quiet, its guards watching nervously for what might come up the Ash Road.

## Key Figures

### Lord Mayor Aldwin Croft
A wealthy grain merchant elected to manage the town's affairs. Desperately trying to maintain neutrality while factions pressure him to choose sides.

### Mistress Vera Cole
The Guildmaster of Merchants, wealthier than some nobles, with connections everywhere. She knows everyone's business and keeps everyone's secrets—for a price.

### Captain Blackwood
Commander of the town watch, a veteran who fought in [[The Great War]]. He's seen [[The Ashen Fields]]. He knows what's coming if no one stops it.

## Secrets

1. **The Ash Road Refugees.** They're not just fleeing poverty. Some have seen things in the southern lands—dead soldiers walking, crops dying overnight, mist that brings nightmares.

2. **The Secret Meeting.** Agents of all four factions have arranged a secret meeting in Crossford. Someone knows about it. Someone plans to ensure it fails.

3. **The Mayor's Debt.** Aldwin Croft owes [[House Valdren]] money he can't repay. His "neutrality" is increasingly a fiction.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Crossroads Conspiracy:** Agents of multiple houses converge on Crossford for secret negotiations. Someone hires the party to ensure the meeting happens—or to ensure it doesn't.

2. **The Southern Refugees:** A group of refugees from [[The Karath Reach]] knows something important about what's happening at [[The Ashen Fields]]. Multiple factions want to reach them first.

3. **The Broken Bridge:** Saboteurs have weakened the King's Bridge. If it falls, east-west trade collapses. Finding the saboteurs reveals a plot reaching far beyond Crossford.
