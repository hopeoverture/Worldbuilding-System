# Eldoria

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a city, create a complex urban center that serves as a major hub of power, commerce, culture, or religion. Cities should have distinct districts, layered social structures, competing factions, and rich history.

## Overview
Eldoria is the crown jewel of Eldermyr—a city of silver-domed towers and ancient stone walls rising from the southern shore of [[The Silvermere]]. For eight centuries it has been the seat of royal power, its harbor the busiest in the realm, its markets the richest, its temples the grandest. But the death of King Aldric III has left the throne empty, and now the Silver City tears itself apart. [[Lord Castellan Maren Ashford]] holds the palace in the name of a king yet to be chosen, while noble factions scheme in every shadow and [[House Valdren]]'s ships blockade the western lake. The city that once symbolized unity now embodies division.

## Geography

### Location
Eldoria occupies a commanding position on [[The Silvermere]]'s southern shore, where the lake narrows before draining into [[The Kingswater]]. The city rises on a series of gentle hills from the waterfront to the palace heights, offering views across the shimmering lake to the distant [[The Greycrowns|Greycrowns]]. Three approaches serve the city: [[The King's Road]] from east and west, the Kingswater for river traffic, and the lake itself for ships from the north.

### Climate
The Silvermere moderates Eldoria's climate, keeping summers cooler and winters milder than the surrounding countryside. Lake fog often shrouds the lower city in morning mist, while lake-effect snow dusts the upper districts in winter. The prevailing westerly winds carry the smell of water and fish into every quarter.

### Layout
Eldoria grew organically from its ancient core, with newer districts radiating outward in concentric rings. The Royal Mile runs from the Lake Gate straight uphill to the palace, dividing the city roughly in half. Major thoroughfares follow the contour of the hills, connected by steep lanes and stairs. The old walls enclose the original seven districts; newer growth sprawls beyond into the Outer Quarters.

**City Map Overview:**
The Royal Palace crowns the highest hill at the city's center. Below it, the Temple District clusters around the Grand Cathedral. The Noble Quarter occupies the eastern slopes with views of the lake. The Merchant's Ring encircles these upper districts. Below the old walls, the Common Quarters spread to north and south, with the Docks along the entire waterfront. The Warrens (slums) huddle in the low ground where the Kingswater exits the lake.

- Halfling population in the Docks (river traders)
- Scattered elves (rare; distrusted)
- Foreign merchants of various origins

### Social Classes
**Nobility/Elite:**
The great houses maintain townhouses in the Noble Quarter, maneuvering for position in the succession crisis. Their wealth insulates them from common suffering, but their children die in the fighting.

**Middle Class:**
Guild members and prosperous merchants struggle to maintain business during the blockade. Many have chosen sides; neutrality grows impossible.

**Common Folk:**
Workers face rising prices and falling wages. Many have lost family members to the war. Resentment builds against all factions.

**Underclass:**
The Warrens overflow with the displaced. Crime rises as desperation grows. The war has created an army of the hopeless.

**Social Mobility:** Frozen by crisis

## Government & Politics

### Government Type
**Type:** Regency (disputed)

**Official Structure:** The Lord Castellan rules as regent until a new monarch is crowned

**Reality of Power:** Multiple factions compete; the Castellan's authority is challenged daily

### Current Ruler
**Title & Name:** Lord Castellan Maren Ashford
**House/Dynasty:** House Ashford (stewards, not claimants)
**In Power Since:** Death of King Aldric III (recent)
**How They Rule:** By consensus and compromise; military force when necessary
**Public Perception:** Respected but seen as temporary
**Private Character:** Exhausted; desperately seeking solution

### Power Structure
**Inner Circle:** Commander of the Crown Guard, High Priest of the Cathedral, Guildmaster of Merchants

**Court/Council:** The Regent's Council (noble representatives; dysfunctional)

**Bureaucracy:** Crown servants continue working; increasingly paralyzed by competing orders

**Corruption Level:** Rising (everyone hedges bets)

### Political Factions
1. **Crown Loyalists:** Support the Castellan's regency; want legitimate succession; led by Lord Ashford
2. **Valdren Faction:** Support House Valdren's candidate; want mercantile interests prioritized; led by Ambassador Valdren
3. **Thorne Faction:** Support House Thorne's candidate; want military strength; led by Lady Thorne (resident noble)
4. **Reformists:** Want elected council instead of monarchy; led by Guildmaster Aldric Goldsmith
5. **Old Faith:** Want return to traditional ways; work in shadows; led by unknown

### Laws & Justice
- Traditional crown law still applies but enforcement is inconsistent
- The Watch is undermanned and poorly paid
- Noble privilege increasingly challenged
- Martial law in some districts after dark
- Justice depends heavily on faction connections

### Foreign Relations
- [[House Valdren]] — Hostile; naval blockade of western lake
- [[House Thorne]] — Tense; maintains embassy but threatens
- Northfolk — Neutral; continue trade
- Foreign kingdoms — Watching; some send "observers"

## Economy

### Economic Overview
Eldoria's economy depends on its position as the realm's administrative and trading heart. The succession crisis has disrupted everything: the Valdren blockade throttles western trade, uncertainty freezes investment, and refugees strain resources. The wealthy hoard; the poor starve; the middle desperately adapts.

### Primary Industries
1. **Government/Administration:** The crown bureaucracy employs thousands
2. **Trade:** Lake and river commerce (now disrupted)
3. **Fishing:** The Silvermere provides food; one stable sector

### Trade & Commerce
- **Exports:** Government services, finished goods, lake fish
- **Imports:** Grain from Eastern March, luxury goods from west (blockaded), timber from north
- **Major Routes:** King's Road, Kingswater, lake shipping (contested)
- **Current Status:** Severely disrupted; black market thriving

### Markets
**Grand Market:** The Silver Exchange (legitimate trade)
**Specialty Markets:** Fish Market (dawn), Craft Market (guild goods)
**Black Markets:** The Warrens deals; Dock-side smuggling

### Guilds & Merchant Houses
| Organization | Focus | Power Level | Leader |
|--------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Merchant's Guild | Trade regulation | High | Guildmaster Aldric Goldsmith |
| Fisher's Guild | Lake fishing | Medium | Master Edmund Nets |
| Craftsmen's League | Artisan trades | Medium | Multiple masters |
| First Bank | Finance | High | Director Marcus Coin |

### Currency & Banking
- Standard crown currency (gold, silver, copper)
- First Bank of Eldoria (main institution; connected to Goldport)
- Currency exchange at the Docks
- Credit increasingly difficult to obtain

### Cost of Living
**General Prices:** Expensive (rising due to shortages)
**By District:** Palace Heights (extravagant), Noble Quarter (expensive), Merchant's Ring (moderate-expensive), Commons (moderate), Warrens (cheap but everything scarce)

## Culture & Society

### City Character
Eldoria feels like a city holding its breath. The grandeur remains—silver domes catch the light, temple bells ring the hours, merchants hawk their wares—but tension underlies everything. Conversations stop when strangers approach. Faction colors mark friend from foe. The wealthy pretend normalcy while the poor wonder where their next meal will come. Hope and fear battle in every heart.

### Social Customs
1. Greeting by bowing depth indicates perceived status
2. Faction colors must be worn in the Noble Quarter
3. Speaking ill of the late king is taboo
4. Hospitality to strangers (once sacred) is now rare

### Traditions & Festivals
1. **Coronation Day:** Anniversary of current king's crowning (suspended)
2. **Silver Festival:** Midsummer celebration of the lake (subdued)
3. **Harvest Thanks:** Autumn festival (food shortages make it bitter)
4. **Saint Aldric's Day:** Religious holiday (still observed)
5. **Year's End:** New year celebration (cancelled due to crisis)

### Religion
**Dominant Faith:** The New Faith (Church of the Divine Light)
**Major Temples:** Grand Cathedral, Shrine of Saint Aldric
**Minority Religions:** Old Ways (underground), foreign gods (Docks)
**Religious Tensions:** New Faith dominant; Old Ways persecuted
**Influence on Government:** High Priest sits on Regent's Council

### Arts & Entertainment
- The Royal Theater (closed; building used for refugee housing)
- The Silver Arena (gladiatorial games; still running)
- Multiple taverns with musicians
- Gambling dens (illegal but tolerated)
- Cultural life diminished by crisis

### Education & Learning
- Royal Academy (administrative training; still functioning)
- Temple schools (religious education)
- Guild apprenticeships (practical training)
- Crown Archives (restricted access)

### Food & Drink
- Lake fish is the staple protein
- Grain increasingly scarce and expensive
- "Silver Wine" (local vintage) still available
- Street food culture struggling
- The wealthy still feast; the poor go hungry

## Defense & Military

### City Watch
- 800 watchmen (undermanned; should be 1,200)
- Quality declining (best recruits join faction militias)
- Controlled by the Castellan
- Corruption increasing
- Captain Helena Stern commands

### City Walls & Fortifications
- Ancient stone walls (30 feet high, 15 feet thick)
- Seven gates (three facing lake, four landward)
- Wall towers every 200 yards
- Outer Quarters unprotected
- Walls in good repair; garrison stretched thin

### Military Forces
**Standing Army:** 3,000 Crown Guard (loyal to Castellan)
**Elite Units:** Palace Guard (200; personal protection)
**Magical Defenses:** Ward stones at gates (ancient; effectiveness uncertain)
**Naval Forces:** Royal Lake Patrol (12 ships; contested by Valdren fleet)
**Siege Equipment:** Stored in palace; unused for generations

### Defense Strategy
The city relies on its walls and the lake for defense. In a siege, the lake provides supply routes—unless blockaded. The current Valdren blockade demonstrates the vulnerability. Food reserves would last perhaps two months under full siege.

### Threats
- House Valdren naval blockade (current)
- House Thorne army (potential)
- Refugee unrest (growing)
- Criminal organizations (opportunistic)
- Internal faction violence (escalating)

## History

### Ancient History
Before Eldoria, a pre-human settlement occupied the heights—foundation stones of unknown origin still support the palace. The Silvermere's silver shimmer attracted human settlers who built fishing villages on the shore.

### Founding
King Aldric I chose this site for his capital 800 years ago, recognizing its defensive position and access to lake trade. The original fortress grew into a palace; the fishing village became a city. Aldric declared Eldoria "the eternal seat of the crown."

### Major Historical Periods
**The Founding Era (800-600 years ago):** Construction of palace, walls, and cathedral
**The Golden Age (600-200 years ago):** Peak prosperity; city reaches current size
**The Modern Era (200-present):** Stability and gradual decline of crown authority
**The Crisis (current):** Succession dispute threatens everything

### Significant Events
1. Founding by Aldric I (800 years ago)
2. Great Fire (500 years ago; half the city rebuilt)
3. The Plague Year (300 years ago; population halved)
4. Completion of Grand Cathedral (250 years ago)
5. Failed Valdren Trade War (100 years ago)
6. Death of King Aldric III (recent; current crisis begins)

### Current Era
The death of King Aldric III without clear heir has plunged Eldoria into chaos. Lord Castellan Ashford maintains order in the city, but his authority doesn't extend beyond the walls. The Valdren blockade strangles trade. Refugees pour in from the countryside. Food grows scarce. Violence increases. Something must break soon—either a new king will be crowned, or the city will tear itself apart.

## Criminal Underworld

### Major Criminal Organizations
1. **The Warrens Guild:** Operates from the Sinking House; traditional thieves; Rat King's domain
2. **Dock Runners:** Smuggling operation; breaks the blockade for profit; leader unknown
3. **The Faction Shadows:** Political assassins; available to any paying faction

### Criminal Activities
- Smuggling booms due to blockade (essential goods fetch premium)
- Protection rackets expand as Watch shrinks
- Assassination market thrives
- Refugee exploitation (labor trafficking)
- Hoarding and black market food sales

### Law Enforcement Response
The Watch is overwhelmed. They maintain presence in wealthy districts but have largely abandoned the Warrens. Faction militias provide "security" in their territories. Justice is increasingly privatized or purchased.

## Secrets

1. The Castellan has been contacted by an entity within the Silvermere claiming to know where the true heir is hidden—but the price for this information may be too high
2. Father Aldric the Elder knows that King Aldric III had a secret, legitimized child but fears what will happen if this becomes public
3. The Drowned Tower is awakening; whatever the pre-human people sealed there is responding to the realm's instability
4. The Rat King is actually Lady Thorne's younger sibling, using criminal networks to support their house's claim
5. A cache of ancient weapons lies beneath the palace, sealed since the founding—weapons that could turn the war

## Plot Hooks

1. The party witnesses a assassination attempt on the Castellan; investigation reveals faction involvement
2. Refugees in Tent City report something hunting them at night—something that came from the lake
3. The Merchant's Guild hires the party to break the blockade through unconventional means
4. An old map surfaces showing tunnels connecting the palace to the Drowned Tower
5. Father Aldric summons the party privately; he needs the secret heir found before others kill them
6. The Rat King offers alliance—criminal resources for help with a faction problem
7. Sanctuary Isle's High Priestess sends word: she's dying, and her choice of successor will determine the religious endorsement
8. Something massive has been seen moving in the Silvermere depths; fishermen refuse to leave harbor

## Rumors & Gossip

1. "The Silver Drake rose from the lake when the king died—it's looking for the true heir." (Partially True—something stirred)
2. "The Castellan plans to declare himself king on Midwinter's Night." (False—he's desperately trying to avoid power)
3. "House Valdren has agents in the palace itself." (True—at least three servants report to them)
4. "There's a secret passage from the Cathedral to the palace." (True—known only to High Priest and Castellan)
5. "The refugees include spies from both factions identifying targets." (True—both sides have planted agents)

**Prompt:**
Wide establishing shot of Eldoria at golden hour, the Silver City that has been the crown jewel of Eldermyr for eight hundred years, now a city holding its breath. The ancient stone walls encircle the original seven districts, their battlements manned by Crown Guard watching for threats from within and without. Silver-domed towers catch the dying sunlight, each one a guild hall or noble residence, while the Grand Cathedral's triple spires pierce the sky like fingers reaching toward the divine. The Royal Palace crowns the highest hill, its famous silver dome—said to be visible from twenty miles away—reflecting the sunset in brilliant oranges and golds, an empty throne room beneath it. The city cascades down the hillside in layers: the Noble Quarter with its private gardens, the Temple District with its sacred heights, the Merchant's Ring bustling with commerce even now, the Common Quarters crowded with working folk, and the Docks where the fishing boats cluster together like frightened sheep. In the harbor, dozens of ships sit at anchor—fishing vessels, merchant galleys, and in the distance, the ominous line of Valdren warships maintaining the blockade that slowly strangles the city's trade. Across the Silvermere, the Greycrown mountains rise in misty silhouette, their peaks still snow-capped. Smoke rises from a thousand chimneys. Refugees camp outside the walls in Tent City. The clouds gathering above seem to mirror the storm building in the realm's politics.

### The Royal Mile at Dusk
**Prompt:**
Street-level view of the Royal Mile in Eldoria at dusk, the main thoroughfare that runs straight uphill from the Lake Gate to the Royal Palace—the path every monarch has walked on the way to coronation for eight centuries. Tall stone buildings with overhanging upper floors line both sides of the cobblestone street, their facades showing the wealth of the Merchant's Ring: carved stone balconies, leaded glass windows, copper awnings turned green with age. Guild signs hang from iron brackets—the crossed hammers of smiths, the golden coin of bankers, the bolt of cloth from weavers. But now, faction banners also hang from upper windows: the purple and black of Valdren, the silver thorns of Thorne, each declaring allegiance in a city where neutrality is becoming impossible. At the center of a small square, a fountain surrounds a bronze statue of King Aldric I, the Founder, one hand raised in blessing—now pigeons roost on his crown and graffiti marks the pedestal with faction slogans. Citizens hurry past: merchants closing their shops early, Crown Guard patrolling in pairs with hands on sword pommels, a noble's sedan chair being carried past commoners who don't step aside as quickly as they once did. The cobblestones are worn smooth by centuries of traffic, wet from recent rain, reflecting the torch-light that's beginning to appear in windows. At the top of the hill, the Royal Palace looms against the darkening sky, its silver dome catching the last light. To the right, the Grand Cathedral's stained glass windows glow with candle-light from vespers. The atmosphere is tension made visible: watchful eyes, hurried movements, the feeling that something is about to break.

### The Docks Under Blockade
**Prompt:**
The Docks of Eldoria at dawn, the lakefront district that once made the city wealthy now struggling under the Valdren blockade. Weathered stone wharves extend into the Silvermere, their wooden additions creaking with age, fishing boats tied three-deep because the merchant ships have stopped coming. The Fish Market is still active—dawn is when the catch comes in—with fishwives calling prices and porters hauling baskets of silvery lake fish, but the volume is a fraction of what it was. Warehouse doors stand closed and padlocked, their contents dwindling. On the water, fishing boats cluster close to shore while in the distance, visible through the morning mist, the dark shapes of Valdren warships patrol in lazy arcs, enforcing the blockade that's slowly starving the city. The architecture of the Docks is rougher than the upper city: functional stone buildings with slate roofs, taverns with hand-painted signs showing drowned sailors and mermaids, rope-makers' shops and net-mending yards. The workers here are hard people with callused hands and suspicious eyes—they've dealt with the recession in trade by supplementing with smuggling, and everyone knows but no one speaks of it. A group of refugees from the countryside huddles near a warehouse, hoping for work unloading the few ships that make it through. The sky is gray, the lake is gray, the stone is gray—only the fresh fish provide color. The atmosphere of a vital artery being slowly choked, of a city's lifeline under siege.

## Notes
Eldoria is the central location of the Eldermyr setting—the stage upon which the succession crisis plays out. Every faction has interests here; every major NPC has connections to the city. Adventures can range from political intrigue in the palace to criminal dealings in the Warrens to supernatural mysteries in the lake. The city should feel like it's barely holding together, with the potential for dramatic change at any moment.
