# Fernglow Warren

## Overview

Fernglow Warren is a network of underground chambers and tunnels beneath [[The King's Wood]]'s Deep Wood, home to approximately 2,000 [[Gnomes|Forest Gnomes]] who have lived there since before the forest became royal property. The Crown doesn't know they exist. The Royal Foresters suspect something lives in the Deep Wood but have never found proof. The gnomes prefer it that way.

The Warren is named for the bioluminescent ferns that light its passages—a unique species that grows nowhere else, cultivated by gnome gardeners for countless generations. These glowing plants create an ethereal atmosphere of soft green light throughout the underground complex.

## Location

The Warren lies beneath the Deep Wood section of [[The King's Wood]], roughly 8 miles from the Old Palace ruins. Entrances are disguised as fallen logs, animal burrows, mushroom rings, and natural sinkholes. You can only find them if the gnomes want you to—and they rarely want anyone to.

## Description

### The Upper Warrens
Near the surface, the Warren consists of interconnected burrows and chambers where most gnomes live. These spaces are cozy rather than cramped, with rounded walls, soft mossy floors, and the gentle glow of fernglow plants. Each family maintains their own cluster of chambers, connected to neighbors by winding passages.

### The Great Hall
The central gathering space is the Great Hall, a natural cavern enhanced by centuries of gnome craft. Here the Warren Council meets, festivals are celebrated, and important decisions are made. The ceiling is covered in fernglow ferns arranged to mirror the night sky.

### The Deep Roots
Below the living areas, the Deep Roots extend into older tunnels that the gnomes didn't dig. These passages connect to something ancient—the same network that touches the Old Palace ruins. The gnomes sealed their end generations ago and don't go there.

### The Gardens
Scattered throughout the Warren are mushroom gardens, root cellars, and cultivation chambers where gnomes grow food without needing surface farms. These gardens produce enough to sustain the community year-round.

## Population

The Warren's 2,000 gnomes are organized into extended family groups called "roots," each tracing lineage back to the original settlers. Population is carefully managed to match the Warren's carrying capacity—gnomes are long-lived enough that slow growth is sustainable.

## Government

### The Warren Council
The Warren is governed by a council of elders, one from each major root, led by the Elder of Elders. Decisions are made by consensus after extensive discussion—gnomes find voting crude and divisive.

### Elder of Elders
**Elder Willowmist Fernglow**, the current leader, is 387 years old and has guided the Warren for sixty years. Her family cultivated the original fernglow ferns; her name honors that heritage. She is wise, cautious, and increasingly worried about events in the wider world.

## Relations with Outsiders

### The King's Wood Foresters
The gnomes observe the Royal Foresters constantly but are never seen in return. They find the humans amusing—so loud, so obvious, so convinced they know the forest. Occasionally a gnome will help a lost forester find their way, appearing as a helpful woodland creature.

### The Old Palace Thing
The gnomes know something lives near the Old Palace. They've known for generations. They don't discuss it with outsiders, don't investigate it, and don't go anywhere near it. Whatever it is has never bothered them, and they intend to keep it that way.

### The Spirit-Speakers
The gnomes have occasional contact with [[The Spirit-Speakers]] of the Northlands, who recognize them as fellow keepers of old ways. These meetings are rare and secret.

## Current Crisis

The forest animals are frightened. Birds that have never left the King's Wood are migrating south. Deer won't enter certain areas. Squirrels bring warnings to their gnome friends—something is wrong.

Elder Willowmist has done something unprecedented: sent a message to the surface world. Whatever is stirring near the Old Palace is becoming active. The gnomes can't investigate safely. They need outside help—but they can't reveal themselves to the Crown.

## Secrets

1. **The Deep Connection:** The Deep Roots connect to tunnels that run beneath all of [[The Crown Lands]]. The gnomes sealed their end, but creatures could potentially travel from [[The Ashen Fields]] to the King's Wood underground.

2. **The Watching Network:** Gnomes throughout the King's Wood maintain a communication network using trained animals. They know everything that happens in the forest—including what [[Lord Varic Valdren]] discusses during his hunting trips.

3. **The Old Palace Truth:** The gnomes' ancestors witnessed what was sealed in the Old Palace. The knowledge has been passed down, Elder to Elder. Willowmist knows—and it terrifies her that it's waking.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Gnomes' Message:** Elder Willowmist has sent an unprecedented request for outside help. Receiving it marks the party as trusted—and obligated.

2. **The Deep Roots:** Something is moving in the sealed tunnels. The gnomes need someone to investigate without revealing the Warren's existence.

3. **Forest Intelligence:** The gnomes offer information about events in [[The Crown Lands]] in exchange for help with their crisis. Their knowledge is remarkably detailed.
