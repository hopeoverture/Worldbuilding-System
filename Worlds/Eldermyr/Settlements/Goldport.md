# Goldport

## Overview
Goldport is where the money lives. Built on Banker's Isle, the third-largest of [[The Valdren Isles]], this fortified town houses the vaults and counting houses that finance half the kingdom's trade. [[House Valdren]] established the banking enclave two centuries ago, and its reputation for security and neutrality has made it the safest place in Eldermyr to store wealth. Every noble house, merchant guild, and shrewd investor keeps accounts here—and that makes Goldport perhaps the most powerful place in the kingdom that owns no armies.

## Geography

### Location
Goldport occupies Banker's Isle, a steep-sided island of volcanic rock five miles southeast of [[Corvana]]. The island's sheer cliffs and single harbor make it naturally defensible. The town climbs the terraced slopes in tiers, with the great vaults carved into the bedrock at the summit. Regular ferry service connects to Corvana; otherwise, approach is by chartered vessel only.

### Climate
Mediterranean maritime with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Sea breezes moderate the heat. The island receives little rainfall but maintains cisterns for water supply. Fog sometimes blankets the lower harbor in mornings.

### Layout
The town rises in four terraces from harbor to summit. The Harbor Tier handles shipping and visitors; the Merchant Tier holds businesses and residences; the Banking Tier contains the great counting houses; and the Vault Tier at the top holds the fortified storage facilities carved into living rock.

**Districts/Quarters:**
1. Harbor Tier — Docks, customs, traveler services
2. Merchant Tier — Residences, shops, minor banking
3. Banking Tier — Major counting houses, exchanges
4. Vault Tier — Secure storage, restricted access

## Demographics

### Population
**Total Population:** 4,200 permanent; daily visitors from Corvana swell numbers

**Breakdown:**
- Permanent residents: 3,500
- Banking staff and guards: 700
- Growth trend: Stable (limited by island space)

### Races & Cultures
Primarily human with Valdren mercantile culture dominant. Significant dwarf presence (20%) in vault security and gemcutting. Halfling accountants are prized. The population values discretion, precision, and absolute trustworthiness.

### Social Classes
The Banking Council sits at the apex; senior bankers and vault keepers hold high status; clerks and functionaries form the middle; servants and laborers (mostly brought from Corvana daily) at the bottom. Wealth alone doesn't grant status—reputation for integrity matters more.

## Government & Politics

### Current Leadership
**Title & Name:** High Banker Vittorio Castellan
**In Power Since:** 18 years
**Reputation:** Incorruptible, secretive, knows everyone's accounts
**Current Priorities:** Maintaining neutrality as factions seek to leverage the vaults

### Town Council/Advisors
1. Vault Master Thrain Ironlock — Dwarf; controls physical security
2. Exchange Mistress Lucia Goldweigh — Currency and gem trading
3. Ledger Master Pip Quickfingers — Halfling; chief accountant
4. Captain of the Guard Adriano Stone — Military security

### Political Factions
1. **Strict Neutralists:** Serve all clients equally regardless of politics
2. **Valdren Loyalists:** Subtly favor House Valdren's interests
3. **Pragmatists:** Will adjust policies to survive the succession crisis

### Outside Authority
Goldport is a possession of [[House Valdren]], but the Banking Council maintains operational independence. The Valdren Compact (signed at the port's founding) guarantees that accounts remain confidential even from House Valdren itself. This neutrality is Goldport's greatest asset.

## Economy

### Primary Industry
**Industry:** Banking and finance
**Description:** Goldport banks hold deposits, issue letters of credit, and finance ventures across the kingdom
**Key Players:** The Five Great Banks control most deposits
**Seasonal Patterns:** Steady year-round; peaks during trade season settlements

### Secondary Industries
1. Currency exchange — Handling coins and trade goods from across the realm
2. Gemcutting — Dwarf artisans process raw gems for secure storage
3. Secure storage — Vaults hold treasures, documents, and secrets

### Trade & Commerce

### Guilds & Organizations
| Guild/Organization | Focus | Influence |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Five Great Banks | Deposits and credit | Very High |

| Exchange Masters | Currency trading | High |
| Gem Cutters Circle | Gem processing | Medium |

### Wealth & Prices
**Overall Wealth:** Wealthy (enormous capital flows through)
**Price Levels:** Expensive (island premium on everything)

## Culture & Religion

### Character
Goldport exudes quiet wealth and absolute discretion. The streets are immaculately clean, the buildings solid and unpretentious, the people well-dressed but not flashy. Nobody discusses clients' business. Trust is the only currency that truly matters here, and those who break it disappear—professionally or literally.

### Traditions
1. The Counting Day — Annual public audit of reserve holdings
2. Vault Blessing — New vaults consecrated with specific rites
3. The Oath of Confidence — Binding vow all employees take
4. Silent Week — Period where no new accounts can open (used for internal audits)

### Religion
The Lady of Fortune (aspect of the New Faith) is primary, but Goldport's true religion is discretion. A temple to the Lady occupies the Merchant Tier; dwarves maintain a shrine to their ancestors near the vaults. All faiths are tolerated if they don't disturb business.

## Defense & Security

### Town Watch/Guard
- 150 town watch (general order)
- 150 vault guards (elite, bank-employed)
- The best-paid guards in the kingdom; incorruptible by design
- Captain Adriano Stone commands; reports to both Council and Valdren

### Fortifications
- Sheer cliffs on three sides; one fortified harbor approach
- Massive sea wall protects the harbor
- Each banking tier has lockable gates
- The Vault Tier is essentially a fortress within a fortress
- Underwater defenses (chains, sea-fire projectors) at harbor entrance

### Military Forces
- No standing army; relies on Valdren naval protection
- Can seal the entire island in minutes if threatened
- Every banker is trained in emergency vault lockdown procedures
- [[House Valdren]]'s fleet considers Goldport protection a sacred duty

### Threats
- Pirates (rare, given Valdren naval power)
- Thieves (many try, none succeed—publicly)
- Political pressure from factions wanting account information
- Economic warfare (runs on banks, currency manipulation)

## History

### Founding
House Valdren established Goldport 200 years ago when they needed a secure location for their trade profits. The island's natural defenses and isolation made it perfect. The founding Banking Compact established the principles of neutrality and confidentiality that persist today.

### Significant Events
1. The Banking Compact (200 years ago) — Established Goldport's neutrality
2. The Iron Vault (150 years ago) — Dwarf engineers created the impregnable summit vaults
3. The Copper Panic (80 years ago) — Survived a kingdom-wide economic crisis
4. Current crisis — All factions want Goldport's favor

### Current Era
The succession crisis has made Goldport's neutrality both invaluable and dangerous. Every faction has accounts here; every faction wants to know about their rivals' finances. High Banker Castellan maintains strict confidentiality, but pressure mounts. Some whisper that whoever controls Goldport's ledgers could control the outcome of the succession itself.

## Secrets

1. High Banker Castellan has already been approached by all four succession factions; he's documented their bribes without accepting them—leverage for later
2. The Iron Vaults contain sealed documents that could delegitimize multiple noble houses' claims to their lands
3. "The Ledger" is actually three people working together—one in each major faction
4. One of the Five Great Banks is secretly insolvent; Castellan is quietly managing a controlled dissolution

## Plot Hooks

1. Someone has been making deposits in the name of [[King Aldric the Just]]—who has been dead for two years
2. A vault has been breached from below; something tunneled up through solid rock
3. The Ledger offers the party valuable information in exchange for a "small favor" in [[Corvana]]
4. Two noble houses' letters of credit both claim the same collateral—war could result if the truth emerges

## Rumors & Gossip

2. Castellan can be bribed if the price is high enough (False—his integrity is absolute)
3. Dwarf tunnelers have found something ancient beneath the vaults (True—they're keeping it quiet)
4. One of the Great Banks is about to collapse (True—but which one?)
