# Greenhollow

## Overview
Greenhollow nestles in a sheltered valley between the rolling hills of [[The Shepherd's Teeth]], where generations of shepherds have tended their flocks on the surrounding grasslands. The village serves as the region's gathering point—where shepherds bring wool to market, share news from distant pastures, and seek shelter during harsh weather. The hollow's natural protection from winds makes it the most pleasant settlement for miles.

## Geography

### Location
Greenhollow occupies a bowl-shaped valley in the central [[Shepherd's Teeth]], sheltered from the prevailing winds by gentle hills on three sides. The village sits fifteen miles from [[The King's Road]] and forty miles from [[Millford]]. Shepherds chose this location for its natural spring, wind protection, and central position among the grazing lands.

### Climate
Moderate upland climate with cool summers and snowy winters. The hollow's sheltered position spares it from the worst winds that scour the hilltops. Spring comes late but brings abundant grass; autumn lingers pleasantly before winter's grip.

### Layout
The village clusters around Shepherd's Well, a natural spring that never runs dry. Twenty-odd cottages with thatched roofs radiate outward along winding paths. The Meeting Hall stands at the village center, largest building in the Hollow. Stone sheep pens line the village edges for market days.

## Demographics

### Population
**Total Population:** 180 permanent; swells during shearing and market seasons

**Breakdown:**
- Permanent residents: 150
- Seasonal workers: 30 (shearing season)
- Extended families: Most households are related by blood or marriage

### Races & Cultures
Entirely human; old hill stock who've shepherded here for centuries. Insular but hospitable to travelers. Their folk traditions blend Old Faith practices with practical superstitions about weather and wool.

### Social Structure
Elder families who control the largest flocks hold the most influence. The village blacksmith and the innkeeper enjoy respected positions. Newcomers are rare and treated with friendly curiosity rather than suspicion—anyone willing to work hard earns acceptance within a season.

## Government & Law

### Leadership
**Type:** Village Elder (elected by household heads)

**Current Leader:** Elder Rowan Meadowbrook

**How Chosen:** Elected every five years by household heads; Rowan has served three terms

### Decision Making
Major decisions go before the village moot, held monthly in the Meeting Hall. The Elder mediates disputes, but the community decides together. Serious crimes (rare) are referred to the lord's justice in [[Millford]], but most matters settle through compensation and community pressure.

### Outside Authority
Greenhollow owes allegiance to [[House Thorne]] through the regional authority based in [[Millford]]. A tax collector visits twice yearly. The village enjoys practical autonomy—no noble troubles themselves with sheep farmers unless wool shipments falter.

## Economy

### Primary Industry
**Industry:** Sheep herding

**Details:**
- Produces fine hill wool prized for durability
- Lambing in spring, shearing in summer, culling in autumn
- Flocks owned by individual families, grazing rights held in common
- "Greenhollow wool" commands premium prices at [[Millford]] markets

### Secondary Activities
- Cheese making from sheep's milk
- Herb gathering from the hillsides (medicinal and culinary)
- Wool spinning and basic weaving

### Trade
- Exports: Wool (primary), cheese, lamb, hill herbs
- Imports: Metal goods, grain, cloth, tools
- Traders visit monthly in good seasons; winter isolation common
- Nearest market: [[Millford]] (40 miles)

### Wealth Level
**Level:** Comfortable

**Evidence:** Well-maintained cottages, no hunger even in hard winters, children look healthy, village fund maintains emergency stores

## Culture & Religion

### Daily Life
Shepherds rise before dawn to check their flocks, spending most daylight hours on the hills. Women and elders manage the village—gardens, cheese-making, spinning. Evenings gather at the Shepherd's Rest tavern for news and song. In winter, the whole village turns to wool crafts, storytelling, and waiting for spring.

### Traditions
1. The Shearing Festival — Three days of celebration after summer shearing
2. The Counting — Autumn ritual tallying each family's surviving flock
3. Wool-Gifting — Newlyweds receive wool from every household

### Religion
The Old Faith predominates, focused on the Shepherd (pastoral aspect) and the Hearthkeeper. A standing stone circle on the hill above the village predates human settlement—locals leave offerings there, though they've forgotten why. Father Clement maintains a small New Faith shrine but draws few worshippers.

### Superstitions
- Never count someone else's sheep (brings ill luck to the flock)
- The standing stones must be circled clockwise at equinoxes (disaster follows otherwise)

## Defense & Security

### Threats
- Wolves (winter, when game is scarce)
- Hill bandits (occasional, usually desperate travelers)
- The Feywild (the [[Standing Stones of Maren]] open unpredictably; things wander through)
- The Risen ([[House Thorne]] territory; corpses sometimes walk the eastern hills)

### Defenses
- No walls; the hollow itself provides concealment
- Warning horns kept at shepherd posts
- The Meeting Hall has stone foundations and can shelter all villagers
- Ancient wards around the standing stones (no one knows who placed them)

### Militia
- All adult shepherds can fight; crooks and slings are traditional weapons
- Hunting bows for wolves; a few spears kept in the Meeting Hall
- Elder Meadowbrook commands in emergencies; served as a soldier in youth
- Survived two wolf winters and one bandit raid in living memory

## History

### Founding
Greenhollow was settled 400 years ago by shepherds seeking grazing grounds away from the expanding lowland farms. The natural spring and sheltered position made it ideal. The standing stones were already ancient when the first settlers arrived.

### Significant Events
1. The Long Winter (90 years ago) — Lost half the flocks; village nearly abandoned
2. The Stone-Night (40 years ago) — Something came through the standing stones; three shepherds vanished
3. Current stability — Twenty good years of wool trade prosperity

### Current Situation
The village prospers but worries grow. The succession crisis has disrupted wool trade to [[Eldoria]]; rumors of walking dead in the eastern hills frighten shepherds; and the standing stones have begun humming on moonless nights—something they haven't done in forty years.

## Notable Figures

**Role:** Village Elder

4. Something dug its way out of the Old Sheepfold last night; the shepherds found a hole but no creature

## Rumors & Gossip

2. Old Tomas was taken by fairies as a child and returned decades later (True—explains his knowledge)
3. Shepherd Mira is meeting a secret lover in the hills (False—far worse)
