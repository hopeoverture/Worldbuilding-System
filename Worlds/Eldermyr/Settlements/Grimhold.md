# Grimhold

## Overview
Grimhold guards the Greycrown Gap, the northern passage between the Eastern March and the Northlands. For centuries, it has watched for threats from the cold north—raiders, monsters, and worse. Now, with something stirring in the mountains and rumors of dead things walking the high passes, Grimhold's garrison finds itself facing the kind of threat the fortress was built to contain.

## Geography

### Location
Grimhold occupies a commanding position where the Greycrown Mountains narrow to a single passable gap. The fortress straddles the gap itself, its walls built into the mountain on both sides. Nothing passes without Grimhold's knowledge and permission.

### The Gap
A natural chokepoint, perhaps two hundred yards wide at the fortress, with sheer cliffs rising on both sides. The pass continues north for miles, gradually widening into the Northland valleys.

### Climate
Harsh highland weather—long winters, heavy snow, biting wind. The garrison is made of hardy folk; weaklings don't last.

## Fortifications

### The Gap Wall
The primary defense—a massive wall spanning the gap, 60 feet high, 30 feet thick, with towers every hundred yards. Gates on both sides allow controlled passage.

### The Twin Keeps
Two fortress towers, one built into each mountainside, connected by the wall. Each can hold independently if the other falls.

### The Deep Stores
Carved into the mountain, vast chambers hold supplies for a two-year siege. Fed by underground springs; provisioned by careful planning.

## Garrison

### Military Strength
- **Total:** 2,000 professional soldiers
- **Infantry:** 1,200 heavy infantry, gap defense specialists
- **Archers:** 400 crossbowmen, trained for mountain warfare
- **Rangers:** 200 scouts, monitoring the passes
- **Reserve:** 200 support troops

### Command
**Lord Commander Aldric Stone-Fist** — A grizzled veteran who lost his hand to frostbite, replaced with a stone prosthetic (carved by Grimhild herself). He's served at Grimhold for thirty years and knows every approach, every weakness, every sound the wind makes.

## Notable Locations

### The Watchtower
The highest point, rising above the wall. Beacon fires can signal Stahlburg within hours.

### The Hall of Shields
Where fallen defenders' shields line the walls, dating back centuries. A new section has been added recently—more shields than usual.

### The Deep Temple
A shrine to the Chronicler, appropriate for those who guard the boundary between the living and whatever lurks in the mountain darkness.

### The Northern Gate
Facing the Northlands, this gate opens for trade, diplomacy, and—rarely—war.

## Current Situation

### Something in the Mountains
Patrols report strange sightings in the high passes—figures that move wrong, tracks that shouldn't exist, sounds at night that freeze the blood. The northern clans send warnings: don't go into the mountains at night.

### Reinforcement Requests
Lord Commander Stone-Fist has asked Stahlburg for reinforcements. With the succession crisis consuming Lady Margret's attention, the response has been delayed.

## Secrets

1. **The Old Passages.** Tunnels predate the fortress, leading deep into the mountains. The garrison has sealed most of them. Most.

2. **The Northern Bargain.** The Northland clans have offered alliance against what stirs in the heights. The price is significant. Stone-Fist hasn't responded yet.

3. **Something came through.** A month ago, something passed the Gap at night. The guards who saw it refuse to describe it. Two have since died in their sleep.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Mountain Dark:** Something is killing patrols in the high passes. Grimhold needs scouts brave enough—or foolish enough—to find out what.

2. **The Northern Alliance:** The clans want to talk. Someone must journey north to negotiate—and survive what lurks between here and there.

3. **The Old Tunnels:** A sealed passage has opened. What came out? What waits within?

## Image Prompts

### Exterior
**Prompt:**
> Wide shot of Grimhold, a fortress spanning a mountain gap. Massive walls 60 feet high connect two keeps built into sheer cliff faces. The Greycrown Gap stretches beyond, a narrow pass between snow-capped peaks. Watch fires burn in tower windows. Soldiers patrol the walls, cloaks snapping in the wind. Snow lies on every surface. The fortress is gray stone, weathered and ancient, built for war and ready for it. The atmosphere is grim, watchful, cold.
