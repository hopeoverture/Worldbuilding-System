# Hammerhall

## Overview
Hammerhall is where steel is born. Nestled at the base of Iron Falls where the Stahlfluss drops two hundred feet, the town exists for one purpose: to forge the finest weapons and armor in Eldermyr. The [[Forgemasters Guild]] calls this home, and [[Grimhild the Smith]]—the legendary Guildmaster—works in her private forge on something she won't discuss. Day and night, the hammers ring; day and night, the forges glow. Everything in Hammerhall serves the craft.

## Geography

### Location
Hammerhall occupies a narrow valley where Iron Falls thunders down from the highland plateau. The falls power scores of waterwheels, which drive the great hammers that shape Eldermyr's steel. Iron ore flows down from the mountains; finished weapons flow out to arm the realm.

### The Falls
Iron Falls is spectacular—two hundred feet of crashing water that never freezes even in the harshest winter (the forges' heat rises up the valley). The spray catches rainbow light. The roar is constant. Visitors must shout to be heard in the upper town.

### Layout
The town arranges itself by function:
- **Upper Town:** Administrative buildings, [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]]'s forge, the Guild Hall
- **The Works:** The great forges, powered by the falls
- **Lower Town:** Worker housing, markets, taverns
- **The Mines Road:** Leading up to the ore deposits

## [[The Forgemasters Guild]]

### Guild Dominance
Unlike other towns, Hammerhall isn't ruled by nobles or appointed officials. [[The Forgemasters Guild]] owns the forges, employs most of the population, and administers the town through its council of Master Smiths. What's good for the Guild is good for Hammerhall.

### Ranks Present
- **Guildmaster:** [[Grimhild the Smith]] (legendary)
- **Master Smiths:** Seven masters, each overseeing different production
- **Journeymen:** Hundreds of skilled workers
- **Apprentices:** Eager young forge-workers learning the trade

### Production
Hammerhall produces:
- Weapons for [[House Thorne]]'s armies
- Armor for nobles across the realm
- Tools for mines, farms, and construction
- Specialty items on commission

## Notable Locations

### [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]]'s Forge
The Guildmaster's private workshop, separate from the main works. What happens inside is her business alone. Recently, she's been receiving unusual shipments—materials that don't look like normal ore.

### The Guild Hall
Administrative center and meeting place for the masters. The walls display examples of legendary work—weapons forged by past Guildmasters, some dating back centuries.

### The Great Works
Twelve massive forges powered by the falls, operating in shifts around the clock. The heat is intense; the noise is overwhelming; the output is extraordinary.

### The Anvil
The town's main tavern, named for its most famous feature—an anvil that legendary smiths supposedly worked on, now enshrined in the common room.

### The Testing Ground
Where weapons are proven against armor, targets, and each other. Quality control is absolute; a flawed weapon never leaves Hammerhall.

## Key Figures

### [[Grimhild the Smith]]
*See [[Grimhild the Smith]]*
The legendary Guildmaster, forging something unprecedented in her private workshop.

### Master Aldric Ironborn
The most senior Master Smith after [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]], effectively the town's administrator. Practical, competent, loyal to the Guild above all.

### Forge-Mother Hilde
Runs the town's shrine to the Warden. The smiths are devout in their way—they pray before beginning major work and thank [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] when a masterpiece emerges.

### Journeyman Karl
A talented young smith, perhaps [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]]'s eventual successor. He's noticed the strange materials arriving at her forge and wonders what she's making.

## Secrets

1. **[[Grimhild's Commission]].** She's forging something meant to kill an immortal. She needs materials from beyond the Ostmark Pass to complete it.

2. **The Old Techniques.** Some Guild secrets border on magic—methods for making steel that shouldn't be possible with mortal craft. [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] doesn't know.

3. **War Profiteering.** The succession crisis is good for business. Some Guild members quietly hope it continues.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Secret Material:** [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] needs something from beyond the Pass. [[Ser Konrad Thorne]] can arrange passage—but what's she really making?

2. **The Saboteur:** Someone is introducing flaws into weapons destined for [[House Thorne]]. Finding the saboteur reveals a conspiracy reaching to [[Aldersgate]].

3. **The Old Forge:** Beneath the town, a sealed chamber contains a forge from before the Guild existed. Something down there still burns.

### The Great Works at Night
**Prompt:**
> Interior of the Great Works in Hammerhall at night, twelve massive forges operating in full production. Molten metal glows orange-white in crucibles, casting dancing shadows across soot-blackened walls. Smiths in leather aprons and protective masks work in teams, their faces illuminated by the forge light. The great water-powered hammers strike in rhythmic thunder. Cascades of sparks shower across the workshop floor. Half-finished weapons and armor hang from racks—swords, breastplates, the tools of war. Through high windows, the spray of Iron Falls catches the firelight. The heat is visible as wavering air. Journeymen rush between stations while Master Smiths oversee their work. The atmosphere of industry and craft pushed to its limits—where Eldermyr's finest steel is born in fire and sweat.
