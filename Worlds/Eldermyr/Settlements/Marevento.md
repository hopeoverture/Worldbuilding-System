# Marevento

## Overview
Marevento builds the ships that make [[The Western Shore|the Western Shore]] wealthy. Every vessel in the Valdren Fleet, every merchant ship that crosses the Trader's Sea, began life in Marevento's yards. The town's craftsmen are artists in wood and rope, and the Shipwright's Guild guards its secrets jealously. When the succession crisis threatens trade, Marevento feels it first—fewer orders, idle workers, and nervous glances toward the ships of foreign powers.

## Geography

### Location
South of [[Porto Valdris]] along [[The Western Shore|the coast]], Marevento occupies a natural harbor perfect for shipbuilding—deep water, calm anchorage, and easy access to timber from the coastal hills.

### The Yards
Seven great shipyards line the waterfront, each capable of building vessels from fishing boats to war galleys. The sound of hammers never stops.

## Economy

### Primary Industry
**Shipbuilding:** Marevento builds everything that floats. The Shipwright's Guild employs a third of the town directly and supplies work to half the rest.

### Trade
The town exports ships and ship-related goods. It imports timber, iron, and specialists. Everything serves the yards.

## Notable Locations

### The Great Yards
Where the Valdren Fleet's warships are built. Currently, three new galleys are under construction—but for whom, exactly, remains politically sensitive.

### The Ropewalk
A quarter-mile covered walkway where the realm's strongest ropes are twisted. The Ropemakers' Guild is subordinate to the Shipwrights but just as proud.

### The Admiral's Rest
A tavern frequented by naval officers and wealthy captains. [[Captain Alonzo the Bold]] keeps rooms here when not at sea.

## Key Figures

### Guildmaster [[Captain Alonzo the Bold|Alonzo Marinetti]]
Master of the Shipwright's Guild, effectively the town's ruler. A practical man caught between Valdren pressure for more warships and the knowledge that arming one side means making enemies of the others.

### [[Captain Alonzo the Bold]]
Admiral of the Valdren Fleet, hero of a dozen sea battles, and Marevento's most famous son. His loyalty to [[House Valdren]] is absolute—but his concern for his hometown sometimes conflicts.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Foreign Order:** A foreign power has secretly ordered ships from Marevento. [[House Valdren|The Valdrens]] don't know—yet. What happens when they find out?

2. **The Saboteur:** Ships launched from Marevento have been failing—subtle weaknesses that only show at sea. Someone is sabotaging the yards.

### Exterior (Wide Shot)
**Prompt:**
> Wide establishing shot of Marevento, the Shipwright's Town, stretching along a natural deep-water harbor on the Western Shore. Seven great shipyards line the waterfront, their dry docks and slipways holding vessels in various stages of construction—skeletal ribs of ships awaiting planking, galleys being fitted with masts, a nearly-complete warship gleaming with fresh paint. Wooden cranes and scaffolding rise above the yards. The town climbs gently from the harbor, timber and stone buildings with red-tiled roofs in the Mediterranean style. Smoke rises from forges and pitch-boilers. The famous Ropewalk stretches along the western edge—a quarter-mile covered structure. Mediterranean blue waters, late afternoon golden light catching brass fittings on ships, the constant activity of a town devoted to building the kingdom's fleet.

### The Great Yards at Dawn
**Prompt:**
> Interior view of Marevento's Great Yards at dawn as work begins on a new Valdren warship. The massive skeleton of a war galley rises from the construction cradle, its keel sixty feet long, ribs curving upward like the bones of a great beast. Shipwrights in leather aprons climb scaffolding, carrying tools and planking. The smell of fresh-cut timber and hot pitch fills the air. Master craftsmen inspect joints with critical eyes while apprentices haul materials. In the background, the harbor is visible through the yard's open front, finished ships riding at anchor awaiting delivery. The Shipwright's Guild banner hangs from a crane. Golden dawn light streams through the structure, catching sawdust motes in the air. The atmosphere of skilled labor and marine tradition—this is where the Golden Fleet is born.
