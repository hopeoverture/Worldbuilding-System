# Millford

## Overview
Millford is the commercial heart of [[The Warden's March]]—a prosperous market town where the grain harvested from endless fields is milled, stored, and shipped to feed the kingdom. Positioned where [[The King's Road]] crosses the Millstream River, the town's seventeen watermills turn day and night during harvest season. Every farmer for fifty miles brings grain here; every merchant heading to [[Eldoria]] passes through its markets.

## Geography

### Location
Millford sits at the ford of the Millstream, roughly halfway between [[Eldoria]] and [[Thornholt]]. The King's Road crosses here, making the town a natural stopping point. The river provides power for the mills and transport for grain barges heading downstream.

### Climate
Continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. Harvest season brings dust clouds; spring brings flooding risk at the ford. The open plains channel winds that whistle through the streets.

### Layout
The town centers on Market Square, with the Millstream dividing it into Eastbank (commercial) and Westbank (residential). The King's Road runs through the center; Mill Row lines the river with its seventeen watermills.

**Districts/Quarters:**
1. Market Square — Central commerce
2. Mill Row — Processing district along river
3. Westbank — Residential and craftsmen
4. Eastbank — Warehouses and merchants

## Demographics

### Population
**Total Population:** 3,500 permanent; swells to 6,000+ during harvest

**Breakdown:**
- Permanent residents: 3,000
- Mill workers: 500 seasonal
- Growth: Stable (tied to agriculture)

### Races & Cultures
| Species | Percentage | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| [[Humans]] | 70% | Eastern March stock; hardworking farmers |
| [[Halflings]] | 25% | Agricultural community; multi-generational |
| Other | 5% | Traveling merchants, laborers |

**Halfling Presence:** Millford is one of the largest [[Halflings|halfling]] communities in [[The Crown Lands]], with approximately 900 halflings living in and around the town. They've been here for centuries, their burrow-homes dug into the riverbanks on the Westbank side, their families running the best bakeries and breweries in town. Rosie Goodbarrel—matriarch of the oldest halfling family—is unofficial leader of the community, and her word carries as much weight as Mayor Wheelwright's among her people. Halflings here want nothing to do with the succession crisis; they just want to farm their fields, bake their bread, and be left alone. The grain wagons heading south to feed armies fill them with quiet dread.

### Social Classes
Prosperous merchants and mill owners at top; skilled workers in middle; seasonal laborers at bottom. Social mobility tied to grain trade success.

## History

Millford began as a simple river ford 300 years ago. The first mill attracted farmers; more mills followed. When the King's Road was paved, the town boomed. House Thorne formalized control 200 years ago.

### Significant Events

2. King's Road paving (brought prosperity)
3. Great Fire (80 years ago; rebuilt better)
4. Current crisis (grain becomes political weapon)

### Current Era
Millford finds itself at the center of Eldermyr's food supply crisis. Lord Thorne controls grain shipments from here, using food as leverage. The townspeople are uncomfortable with politics but have no choice.

### Halfling Elder
**Name:** Rosie Goodbarrel
**Role:** Matriarch of Millford's [[Halflings|halfling]] community
**Description:** The unofficial leader of the town's 900 halflings, Rosie runs a bakery that's been in her family for six generations. Her burrow-home on Westbank has become the meeting place for halflings worried about the succession crisis. She has no political power, but she knows everything that happens in Millford through her extended network of kin—and she's fiercely protective of her people.
**Influence:** None official; immense among halflings; respected by humans who know her

## Secrets

1. Mayor Wheelwright has been skimming grain shipments, building a personal reserve against uncertain times
2. Flour Marten works for [[House Valdren]], ensuring some grain reaches the western factions
3. The Great Granary has structural weaknesses; a fire would destroy the March's reserves

## Plot Hooks

1. A grain shipment has gone missing; both Thorne agents and smugglers are suspects
2. Ankhegs have been spotted in the fields near town; someone needs to clear them before harvest
3. Flour Marten offers the party good money to escort a "special shipment" past Thorne checkpoints
4. The granary is being sabotaged; someone wants the kingdom to starve

5. **The Halfling Underground:** Rosie Goodbarrel has been quietly helping refugees from the south pass through Millford—families fleeing the coming war. Now one of her "guests" is being hunted by Thorne soldiers. She needs help getting them to safety without exposing the network she's built.

6. **Burrow Secrets:** The halfling warrens on Westbank extend deeper than anyone realizes—and they connect to old tunnels that predate the town. Something has been moving in those tunnels. Rosie needs discreet help investigating before whatever it is threatens her people.
