# Port Corsair

## Overview
Port Corsair is where [[House Valdren]]'s legendary [[Golden Fleet]] sleeps—and where it wakes when war demands. The naval base occupies Sword Isle, the most defensible of [[The Valdren Isles]], with a natural deep-water harbor protected by fortress cliffs on three sides. Every warship, marine, and naval officer in Valdren service passes through here. The town exists to support the fleet: building ships, training sailors, and projecting power across Eldermyr's waters.

## Geography

### Location
Sword Isle lies at the western edge of [[The Valdren Isles]], positioned to intercept any naval approach to the archipelago. The island's distinctive shape—narrow and elongated like a blade—gives it its name. [[Corvana]] lies twelve miles northeast. The harbor can shelter the entire Golden Fleet in foul weather and launch it within hours.

### Climate
Maritime Mediterranean with stronger winds than the inner islands. Storm season brings heavy weather that tests ships and sailors alike. The exposed position means Port Corsair feels every shift in wind and wave.

### Layout
The town wraps around the crescent harbor in functional zones: dockyards to the east, barracks and training grounds to the west, support services in between. The Admiral's Fortress crowns the headland overlooking the harbor entrance. Everything is built for war—no decorative architecture, no wasted space.

**Districts/Quarters:**
1. Dockyards — Shipbuilding, repair, fitting
2. Anchor Town — Sailor housing, taverns, services
3. Marine Quarters — Barracks, training grounds, armories
4. The Fortress — Command center and harbor defenses

## Demographics

### Population
**Total Population:** 3,800 permanent; swells when fleet is in port

**Breakdown:**
- Civilian support staff: 1,500
- Naval personnel (permanent): 1,300
- Shipyard workers: 1,000
- Fleet crews (variable): 2,000-4,000 when ships are present

### Races & Cultures
Human-dominant with Valdren maritime culture. More diverse than other Valdren settlements due to naval recruitment from across the kingdom. Former pirates, coastal villagers, and second sons of noble houses serve together. The fleet creates its own culture of loyalty and competence.

### Social Classes
Naval rank determines everything. Admiral Stormwind commands absolute authority; ship captains form the elite; skilled sailors and marines hold respect; landlubber support workers rank below even common deckhands. The hierarchy is rigid but meritocratic—ability determines promotion.

## Government & Politics

### Current Leadership
**Title & Name:** Admiral Cira Stormwind
**In Power Since:** 8 years (appointed by Lord Valdren)
**Reputation:** Brilliant tactician, harsh disciplinarian, absolutely loyal to Valdren
**Current Priorities:** Fleet readiness; navigating the succession without committing to a losing side

### Town Council/Advisors
1. Commodore Vasco Blacktide — Second in command; fleet operations
2. Shipmaster Elena Keelwright — Controls the dockyards
3. Marine Commander Bruno Ironshore — Ground forces and harbor defense
4. Quartermaster General Pietro Stores — Logistics and supply

### Political Factions
1. **Valdren Loyalists:** Most personnel; serve the House without question
2. **Crown Traditionalists:** Some officers favor restoring royal authority over the fleet
3. **Professional Sailors:** Care only about naval matters; politics is for admirals

### Outside Authority
Port Corsair answers directly to [[House Valdren]] through Admiral Stormwind. Unlike [[Goldport]]'s independence, the naval base is firmly under noble control. The Lord of Valdren (currently Lady Serena) can order the fleet to any action, and it will obey.

## Economy

## Culture & Religion

### Character
Port Corsair runs on discipline and pride. The Golden Fleet is the kingdom's finest naval force, and everyone here knows it. Sailors walk with swagger; officers demand perfection; even dockworkers take pride in their contribution to Valdren naval supremacy. It's loud, rough, and absolutely professional.

### Traditions
1. Fleet Week — Annual celebration when all ships return for inspection
2. The Admiral's Toast — Before every voyage, crews toast their commander
3. Burning the Hulk — Retired ships are ceremonially burned at sea
4. First Blood — New sailors earn their place through ritual hazing

### Religion
The Storm Lord (god of sea and weather) dominates. The chapel at the harbor mouth is where sailors pray before departing and give thanks upon return. Superstitions abound—no sailing on certain days, specific rituals for launching ships, offerings to appease the deep.

## Defense & Security

### Town Watch/Guard
- 200 naval marines (primary security)
- 600 fleet sailors (available for defense)
- Marines handle both military and civil security

- The Admiral's Fortress commands the harbor entrance
- Sea chains can close the harbor mouth
- Ballistae and catapult emplacements cover all approaches

- Marine detachments: 500+ combat-ready troops
- Harbor defense batteries: can sink any approaching enemy
- Fire-ships maintained in reserve for desperate measures

### Threats
- Enemy fleets (currently theoretical; no naval rival exists)

- Storms (the real enemy; claim ships every year)
- Internal tensions (if succession forces the fleet to choose sides)

## History

### Founding
Port Corsair was established 180 years ago when [[House Valdren]] decided their growing merchant wealth needed military protection. The natural harbor on Sword Isle was perfect for a naval base. Within two generations, the Golden Fleet had no rival on Eldermyr's waters.

### Significant Events
1. Founding of the Golden Fleet (180 years ago)
2. The Pirate Crushing (120 years ago) — Eliminated organized piracy in Valdren waters
3. Battle of Red Reef (60 years ago) — Defeated a coalition of rival merchant cities
4. Current crisis — The fleet waits to see which way the succession falls

### Current Era
Admiral Stormwind keeps the fleet ready and officially neutral in the succession crisis. [[House Valdren]] hasn't committed the Golden Fleet to any faction, making it a prize everyone courts. The Admiral knows that whoever the fleet supports will likely win—and that choosing wrongly could destroy the fleet and House Valdren with it.

## Secrets

1. The "special stores" in the armory contain alchemical weapons captured from the pirate wars—some too dangerous to use, too valuable to destroy
2. Commodore Blacktide has been approached by Crown loyalists; he hasn't reported the contact
3. Admiral Stormwind has private orders from Lady Valdren to support a specific succession candidate—but only when the time is right
4. Big Rosa still has contacts in the pirate communities; she could arrange "accidents" at sea for the right price

## Plot Hooks

1. A ship returned from patrol with its entire crew dead at their posts—no wounds, no explanation
2. Someone is sabotaging ships in the dockyard; marine commanders suspect Crown agents
3. Big Rosa needs a crew for a "salvage operation" that's definitely not piracy
4. The Admiral needs discreet investigators to determine if Commodore Blacktide is a traitor—or being framed

## Rumors & Gossip

1. The Admiral knows which candidate the fleet will support and has sealed orders (True)
2. Something lives in the deep harbor—sailors won't swim there after dark (True—but harmless; just very large)
3. Commodore Blacktide is planning a mutiny (False—he's being tested by the Admiral herself)
4. The pirates are regrouping in the outer islands (True—someone has been funding them)
