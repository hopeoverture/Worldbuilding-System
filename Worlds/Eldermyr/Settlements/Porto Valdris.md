# Porto Valdris

## Overview
Porto Valdris is a city built on gold—not mined, but earned through centuries of trade across the Trader's Sea. Its white marble facades, terraced hillsides, and gilded domes proclaim wealth that would shame the treasuries of lesser kingdoms. Here, merchant princes negotiate deals that shape nations, and the Valdren family has parlayed commercial success into political dominance. Now, with a Valdren as regent and a Valdren boy as heir, the Golden City stands poised to become the true power behind the throne—if it can keep its many debts from coming due.

## Geography

### Location
Porto Valdris occupies a crescent-shaped natural harbor on the western coast, protected from storms by the Shepherd's Teeth headland to the north. The city rises in terraces from the waterfront to the high ground where the Palazzo Valdris commands views of both the harbor and the Trader's Sea beyond. The Valdris River provides fresh water and a route to the interior.

### Climate
Mediterranean—mild wet winters, long dry summers, and sea breezes that moderate the heat. The city rarely sees frost, and flowers bloom year-round in the famous Valdren Gardens.

### Layout
The city follows its natural contours, rising in levels from the bustling waterfront to the exclusive heights. Winding streets connect sun-drenched plazas; fountains splash in every square; and the architecture displays the wealth accumulated over generations.

**The Waterfront:** Docks, warehouses, shipyards, and the establishments serving sailors—rough but profitable.

**The Merchant Quarter:** The commercial heart, home to the Exchange, banking houses, and the great trading companies.

**The Garden Terraces:** Middle and upper-class residences climbing the hillsides, each level more exclusive than the last.

**Palazzo Hill:** The heights where House Valdren and the greatest merchant families maintain their palatial estates.

## Economy

### Commercial Dominance
Porto Valdris controls roughly 60% of Eldermyr's foreign trade. The Merchant's Exchange sets commodity prices for the entire realm. Every major trading house maintains an office here; every significant deal passes through the city's counting houses.

### The Valdren Bank
The largest financial institution in Eldermyr, it extends credit to great houses, finances trade expeditions, and holds debts that give the Valdrens leverage over half the realm's nobility.

### Trade Routes
**Lo Stretto d'Oro (The Golden Strait):** The narrow passage between the mainland and the offshore islands, controlled by Valdren fortifications. Every ship entering or leaving the Trader's Sea pays toll here.

**The Coastal Run:** Sea routes connecting Porto Valdris to other ports along both coasts.

**The River Road:** The Valdris River provides water access deep into the Crown Lands.

### Primary Industries
1. **Trade & Shipping:** The city's lifeblood—import, export, and everything between
2. **Banking & Finance:** Credit, investment, money-changing, and debt collection
3. **Shipbuilding:** The Marevento yards are nearby, but Porto Valdris maintains significant capacity
4. **Wine & Luxury Goods:** The surrounding hills produce the realm's finest wines

## Government & Politics

### The Valdren Way
Officially, Porto Valdris is ruled by House Valdren under royal authority. In practice, the city is governed by an oligarchy of wealthy merchant families who sit on the Merchant's Council. The Valdrens are first among equals—their vote counts triple, but they must still maintain alliances.

### The Merchant's Council
Fifteen seats representing the greatest trading houses. Decisions require majority vote. The Valdrens hold three votes; their closest allies another four; the remainder split among factions that shift with the winds of profit.

### Current Politics
With Varic in Aldersgate as Regent, his wife Lady Serana manages the city. The Merchant's Council is fractured between those who support Valdren ambitions and those who fear overreach. Foreign interests probe for weakness.

## Defense & Security

### City Watch
**Size:** 2,000 officers in distinctive blue cloaks
**Quality:** Professional, well-paid, generally honest—corruption is bad for business
**Leadership:** Watch-Commander Marco del Ponte, a former naval officer

### Fortifications
The city walls are maintained but not impressive by Stahlburg standards. The true defense lies in the naval fortress at the Golden Strait—any attacker must first break the chain that closes the harbor.

### Naval Forces
**The Valdren Fleet:** 40 war galleys, 20 fast patrol ships, and the great carrack *Gold of the Sea*—the largest vessel in the realm. The fleet can blockade any coast, escort any convoy, and sink any rival.

### The Golden Chain
A massive chain can be raised across the harbor entrance, closing Porto Valdris to hostile ships. It has been raised only three times in history; twice the attackers withdrew rather than challenge it.

## Notable Locations

### Palazzo Valdris
The seat of House Valdren, a white marble palace covering the highest ground. Its gilded domes are visible from the harbor. The Grand Hall can host a thousand guests; the private vaults hold treasures beyond counting—and debts that could crush lesser houses.

### The Merchant's Exchange
Where commodity prices are set and fortunes made or lost in hours. The great trading floor buzzes with activity from dawn to dusk. The chime of the Exchange Bell opens and closes trading.

### The Cathedral of the Open Hands
The largest temple in the city, dedicated to the Shepherd aspect. Its charity feeds thousands of the poor—and its popularity gives the Faith leverage even the Valdrens must respect.

### The Golden Chain Fortress
Guarding the harbor entrance, this fortification can close the entire port. Its garrison answers to House Valdren alone, not the city watch.

### The Sunken Palace
Visible beneath the waves on clear days—ruins predating the current city. Divers claim to see treasures in the depths. The Faith quietly discourages exploration, claiming the ruins are cursed.

## Key Figures

### Lady Serana Valdris
Lord Varic's wife, managing the city while he plays regent in Aldersgate. Brilliant, beautiful, and utterly devoted to her family's interests. She's aware of dark currents beneath the city's prosperity—foreign debts, growing resentment, the hollow nature of Valdren wealth.

### Marco Fortunato
The wealthiest merchant who isn't a noble. His trading empire rivals the Valdrens in some sectors. Officially loyal, privately resentful of the nobility's privileges. He sits on the Merchant's Council with three votes worth of allies.

### Captain Alonzo the Bold
Admiral of the Valdren Fleet, a naval legend who once defeated a pirate armada single-handedly. Old now, but his tactical genius remains sharp. Fiercely loyal to House Valdren—they made him what he is.

### Sister Carissa
The beloved healer of the Cathedral, known for miracles that the Faith officially neither confirms nor denies. The common folk adore her. She speaks uncomfortable truths about the gap between rich and poor.

### The Spider
A criminal figure who controls much of the harbor's smuggling and vice. No one knows their true identity. They maintain order among criminals—for a price.

## Secrets

1. **The Valdren Debt.** House Valdren owes the Sun Courts more gold than exists in their vaults. They've been paying interest with trade concessions. If the truth emerged, creditors would demand immediate payment—crashing the entire economy.

2. **The Sunken Palace contains something dangerous.** The ruins predate the Three. Something sleeps there that the Faith has been keeping quiet for centuries. Recent disturbances suggest it may be waking.

3. **Foreign agents everywhere.** Every major foreign power has spies in Porto Valdris. Some are on the Merchant's Council. Some are in House Valdren's own household.

4. **The succession threatens everything.** If House Thorne wins, they'll punish Valdren overreach. If the Faith gains control, they'll demand debt forgiveness for temples. If the Karaths somehow rise, they'll burn the city that funded their defeat.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Sinking Fortunes:** A major trading house is about to collapse, threatening to take dozens of smaller businesses with it. Someone's manipulating the situation—but who, and why?

2. **The Sunken Palace Stirs:** Fishermen are disappearing near the ruins. The Faith wants discreet investigators who won't ask uncomfortable questions about what's down there.

3. **The Spider's Web:** Someone's trying to unify the city's criminal elements. The Spider is either behind it or fighting against it. Either way, bodies are floating in the harbor.

4. **Foreign Interest:** A diplomatic mission from the Sun Courts arrives with generous gifts—and impossible demands. They know about the debt. They want something more than gold.

5. **Lady Serana's Problem:** The Lady of Porto Valdris needs trustworthy agents for a task too sensitive for the family's usual operatives. Her husband must never know.
