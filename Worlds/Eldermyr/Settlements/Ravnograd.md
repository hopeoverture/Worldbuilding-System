# Ravnograd

## Overview
Ravnograd was once the second-largest town in [[The Karath Reach]], a prosperous trade hub where goods from the south met merchants from the rest of the realm. Now it is a ghost of itself—half the buildings stand empty, the market square sees few traders, and those who remain do so because they have nowhere else to go. The curse spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]] has not yet reached Ravnograd, but its effects have—failed harvests, dying livestock, and a pervasive sense of doom.

## Geography

### Location
Ravnograd sits at the junction of the Ash Road (the main route from [[The Crown Lands]] to [[The Karath Reach]]) and the coastal road to [[The Bitter Coast]]. This position once made it wealthy; now it merely means the town watches both roads fall into disuse.

### Terrain
Flat farmland surrounds the town—or did. Now the fields lie fallow, the farmers fled or dead. The soil still looks normal, but nothing will grow well anymore.

### Climate
The same wrong weather that afflicts all of [[The Karath Reach]]. Winters too cold, summers too dry, a perpetual gray cast to the sky even on clear days.

## Current State

### The Decline
Before [[The Great War]], Ravnograd had 25,000 people. After the war, 15,000. Now, barely 8,000 cling to existence. Every year, more families pack what they can carry and flee north. Those who remain are the old, the stubborn, and those too poor to leave.

### Empty Quarters
Whole districts stand abandoned. The eastern quarter, closest to [[The Ashen Fields]], was evacuated five years ago when the curse began spreading faster. Now it's home to scavengers, ghosts, and things that might be either.

### The Waiting
Everyone in Ravnograd knows the curse is coming. They don't know when—the spread is unpredictable—but they know. Some stay to be close to their ancestors' graves. Some stay because [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] has promised salvation. Some just stay because leaving feels like surrender.

## Government

### Vestigial Authority
Mayor Borislav nominally governs Ravnograd, but his authority is hollow. The town council no longer meets. The guard is down to a hundred men who are more concerned with preventing looting than maintaining order. Real authority comes from [[Chernogrod]]—from [[Lord Draven Karath]] and his agents.

### Karath Influence
[[House Karath]] agents are present in Ravnograd, watching, recruiting, and occasionally making people disappear. [[Lord Draven Karath|Lord Draven]] considers Ravnograd's population a resource—angry, desperate people who might serve his purposes.

## Economy

### Collapse
The economy has effectively collapsed. The trade that once sustained the town has dried up—few merchants risk the Ash Road anymore. What remains:
- Fishing along [[The Bitter Coast]]
- Salvage from abandoned buildings and farms
- Black market trade with [[Chernogrod]]
- Whatever can be grown in the still-viable fields

### Prices
Everything costs more here than it should. Food is imported at high prices. Medicine is scarce. Hope is unavailable at any cost.

## Culture

### The Grieving
Ravnograd's culture has become one of perpetual mourning. The old songs are dirges now. The festivals are memorials. The temple bells ring for the dead more often than for the living.

### Karath Pride
Despite everything—or because of it—the people of Ravnograd maintain a fierce pride in their Karath heritage. They remember when this was prosperous land. They remember whose war destroyed it. They nurse their grudges alongside their grief.

## Notable Locations

### The Empty Market
The great market square that once bustled with trade now sees only a handful of vendors selling what little there is. Weeds grow between the cobblestones.

### The Temple of Sorrows
The local temple to [[The Faith of the Three]] has become a temple of mourning. The priests perform more funerals than any other service.

### The Eastern Gate
Sealed and guarded, the gate facing [[The Ashen Fields]]. No one opens it. Sometimes, at night, things knock on the other side.

### Mayor Borislav's House
The largest building still occupied, where the mayor pretends to govern while waiting for orders from [[Chernogrod]].
