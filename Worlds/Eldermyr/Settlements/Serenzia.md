# Serenzia

## Overview
Serenzia is where the Western Shore goes to be beautiful. Terraced vineyards produce the realm's finest wines; artists and poets gather in sun-drenched plazas; and the Sereni Academy trains the next generation of diplomats, scholars, and artists. Unlike the commercial bustle of Porto Valdris, Serenzia cultivates refinement. The current crisis has brought an edge to the town's pleasant atmosphere—too many nobles with too much time and too many opinions.

## Geography

### Location
Inland from the coast, Serenzia occupies hillsides covered in vineyards. The town spreads across multiple hills, connected by shaded paths and terraces. No walls confine it—Serenzia trusts in its pleasant uselessness for protection.

### The Vineyards
The surrounding hills are striped with grape terraces. The Serenzia vintage is legendary—bottles sell for more than a common laborer earns in a month.

## Economy

### Primary Industry
**Wine Production:** The great families own the vineyards and produce wines that grace noble tables across the realm. The Wine Merchants' Guild handles distribution.

### Secondary Industries
- **Art:** Painters, sculptors, poets, and musicians find patronage here
- **Education:** The Sereni Academy trains future leaders in rhetoric, philosophy, and diplomacy
- **Luxury Goods:** Fine textiles, jewelry, and crafts

## Notable Locations

### The Sereni Academy
The realm's finest educational institution, where noble children learn the arts of civilization. Graduates become diplomats, advisors, and the occasional spy.

### The Theatre of Masks
A famous performance venue where plays, operas, and concerts draw audiences from across the region. Political satire walks a dangerous line.

### The Vintage Hall
Headquarters of the Wine Merchants' Guild, with cellars holding bottles worth kingdoms.

### The Artists' Quarter
Where painters, sculptors, and poets live, work, and argue about beauty. Patrons come to commission works; models come to be immortalized.

## Key Figures

### Lord Patrician Marco Sereni
The town's nominal ruler, more interested in his wine collection than politics. His neutrality is carefully maintained—everyone buys Serenzia wine.

### Maestro Lorenzo Bellini
The Academy's headmaster, educator of future leaders. He knows secrets about every great house's children—the ones who passed through his halls.

### Lady Viola Amoroso
The realm's most famous poet, whose verses circulate in manuscript. Her political poems are veiled but pointed; everyone tries to guess who she's criticizing now.

## Current Situation

### The Nervous Peace
Serenzia's neutrality is strained. Representatives of all factions have "summer homes" here, using the cultural excuse to meet and scheme. The town pretends not to notice.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Poisoned Vintage:** Someone has poisoned a shipment of Serenzia's finest wine—bound for a noble wedding. Hundreds could die. Who did it, and can it be stopped?

2. **The Academy Secrets:** A student has discovered something in the Academy archives—secrets about the great houses' children. Now they're dead, and the secrets are missing.

3. **Lady Viola's Truth:** The poet's latest work names names. Before it can be published, she's vanished. Finding her reveals a conspiracy.
