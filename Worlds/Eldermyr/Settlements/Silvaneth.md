# Silvaneth

## Overview

Silvaneth is the largest wood elf settlement in [[Myrkvid]], a living city grown from the ancient trees themselves over countless centuries. Unlike human settlements that impose structure upon the land, Silvaneth exists in harmony with the forest—buildings are grown rather than built, paths follow the natural flow of the wood, and the boundary between settlement and wilderness is deliberately unclear.

To outsiders who stumble upon Silvaneth, it appears as if the forest itself has arranged itself into homes and halls. Trees bend to form doorways, roots rise to create stairs, and living branches weave into roofs that bloom with the seasons. The wood elves say they did not build Silvaneth—they asked the forest, and the forest agreed.

## Location

Silvaneth lies deep within [[Myrkvid]], roughly 40 miles from the forest's southern edge. No road leads there; the paths shift with the forest's will, and only those the elves wish to find the way will find it. The settlement spreads across several square miles, though "spread" suggests a density that doesn't apply—Silvaneth is more a loose network of groves and glades than a concentrated town.

## Description

### The Approach
Those permitted to approach Silvaneth find the forest gradually becoming more... intentional. Trees grow in patterns that suggest architecture. Paths appear where none existed. Animal sounds take on the quality of deliberate signals. By the time visitors realize they've entered the settlement, they've been within its boundaries for miles.

### The Heart Grove
The center of Silvaneth is the Heart Grove, where the oldest trees stand—specimens thousands of years old whose roots interweave beneath the entire settlement. The Silvarch's Hall grows from the largest of these ancients, a living palace of wood and leaf that serves as the community's gathering place.

### The Dwelling Trees
Wood elf homes are living things, shaped over generations into comfortable dwellings. Each family tends their dwelling tree, encouraging growth in useful directions, pruning where necessary, and decorating with woven vines and flowering plants.

### The Moon Pools
Sacred pools reflect the moon's light even on cloudy nights. The elves gather here for ceremonies, divinations, and the rare occasions when outsiders are permitted audience with the Silvarch.

## Population

Silvaneth's approximately 8,000 wood elves represent most of Myrkvid's elven population. Unlike human settlements, the population has remained stable for centuries—the elves regulate their numbers to match what the forest can sustainably support.

## Government

### The Silvarch
Silvaneth is led by the Silvarch, currently **Silvarch Aelindra Starweave**, a wood elf of nearly 600 years who has held the position for two centuries. The Silvarch speaks for the forest as much as for the people, interpreting the land's will and guiding the community in harmony with nature.

### The Circle of Seasons
Four elders, each representing a season, advise the Silvarch and handle the practical governance of the settlement. Disputes, trade agreements, and relations with outsiders fall to the Circle.

## Relations with Others

### The Northfolk
The wood elves maintain cautious but generally positive relations with [[The Northlands]]' human population. Both peoples respect the forest and the Old Ways; neither threatens the other. Trade occurs at the forest's edge, where wood elf crafts exchange for metal goods the elves cannot make themselves.

### The Crown
Officially, Silvaneth doesn't exist. [[The Crown Lands]] government considers Myrkvid uninhabited wilderness. The elves prefer this—they have no interest in human politics, taxes, or laws.

### The Spirit-Speakers
[[The Spirit-Speakers]] and the wood elves share spiritual kinship. Both honor the land, the ancestors, and the cycles of nature. Spirit-Speakers are among the few humans permitted to enter Silvaneth.

## Secrets

1. **The Deep Wood's Secret:** The elves know what lives in Myrkvid's deepest reaches—ancient fey entities that predate the forest itself. They maintain careful treaties that humans know nothing about.

2. **The Sickness:** Something is wrong in the southern reaches of Myrkvid. Trees are dying in ways they shouldn't. The elves suspect the curse from [[The Ashen Fields]] is spreading through underground waterways.

3. **The Watching:** Silvaneth's scouts monitor all approaches to the forest. The elves know far more about events in Eldermyr than humans suspect—they simply choose not to intervene.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Forest's Warning:** Silvarch Aelindra sends word through [[Elder Faelar Moonwhisper]]—the elves have seen something in the deep wood that concerns them enough to seek outside help.

2. **Lost in Myrkvid:** Someone important has vanished in the forest. Finding them requires navigating to Silvaneth and convincing the elves to help.

3. **The Spreading Blight:** The curse from [[The Ashen Fields]] is reaching Myrkvid's roots. The elves need allies to investigate and, if possible, stop it at the source.
