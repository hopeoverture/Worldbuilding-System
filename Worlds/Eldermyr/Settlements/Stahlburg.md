# Stahlburg

## Overview
Stahlburg is less a city than a weapon given stone form. Carved into the face of a granite mountain at the edge of the Ostmark Range, this fortress-city has never fallen to siege or storm. For five hundred years, [[House Thorne]] has ruled from these iron-gray walls, forging soldiers as the lower city forges steel. Now, with [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] plotting for the throne and her sons commanding armies that could shatter any force in the realm, Stahlburg stands ready to decide whether the next king will be crowned—or made.

## Geography

### Location
Stahlburg occupies a commanding position where the highland moors rise toward the Ostmark Range. The lower city sprawls across a narrow valley between two granite outcrops, while the fortress proper—the Iron Keep—is carved directly into the larger mountain face. The Stahlfluss River provides water and power for the forges that never stop burning.

### Terrain
The approach to Stahlburg forces any army through three narrow passes, each overlooked by watchtowers. The valley floor has been carefully cleared of cover, creating killing grounds visible from every wall. Behind the city, the mountains rise impassable for miles.

### Climate
Highland continental—harsh winters with heavy snow, short intense summers, and a perpetual wind that carries the smell of forge smoke and mountain stone. The locals say you can smell Stahlburg's iron from ten miles away.

## Layout

### The Lower City
The civilian settlement fills the valley floor, organized around the Stahlfluss and its many mill-races. Streets follow the terrain in practical lines—no grand avenues, but efficient routes between forges, barracks, and markets. Everything serves the military purpose.

**Forge Quarter:** The heart of the city's industry, where the Stahlfluss powers dozens of water-wheels driving hammers and bellows. Smoke and sparks rise day and night.

**Soldier's Town:** Housing for garrison families, training grounds, and the establishments that serve military men—taverns, armories, temples to the Warden.

**The Gateworks:** The heavily fortified lower district where the great valley gates stand. Three successive gates, each with its own killing ground.

### The Iron Keep
Carved into the mountain itself, the fortress rises in seven levels connected by defensible stairs and passages. The lowest level holds the great forges; the highest, the Wardeness's chambers. Each level can be sealed and defended independently.

## Fortifications

### Valley Defenses
- Three successive gates with murder holes, portcullises, and overlapping fields of fire
- Walls 40 feet high, 20 feet thick, faced with iron plates
- Twelve towers commanding every approach
- The valley floor channeled to flood on command

### The Iron Keep
- Carved from living granite—walls cannot be undermined
- Seven defensible levels, each a fortress unto itself
- The Iron Stair—a single narrow approach to the upper levels
- Secret passages known only to the Thorne family
- Water from mountain springs; food stores for two years

### Siege Capability
Stahlburg has never fallen. Historical sieges have lasted up to three years before attackers withdrew. The combination of natural defenses, iron-faced walls, and the sheer determination of Marcher folk makes the fortress effectively impregnable to medieval siege techniques.

## Demographics

### Species Distribution
| Species | Percentage | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| [[Humans]] | 82% | Marcher stock; practical and martial |
| [[Orcs]] | 10% | Mercenary families; three generations established |
| [[Dwarves]] | 6% | Smiths and engineers from [[Hammerhall]] |
| Other | 2% | Travelers, traders |

### The Orc Quarter (Grünholm)
Three generations ago, [[House Thorne]] made a controversial bargain: [[Orcs|orc]] warriors would defend [[Ostmark Pass]] in exchange for land, pay, and legitimacy. Today, the Grünholm district on the city's eastern edge houses some 4,500 orcs—soldiers, their families, and a growing community of craftsmen and laborers. Warchief Grokmar Ironjaw commands the Ostmark Mercenary Company from here, coordinating with [[Ser Viktor Thorne]] on pass defense. The district is self-governing under Thorne oversight, with its own markets, shrines to the orcish war-god, and fighting pits where disputes are settled. Humans view Grünholm with suspicion; the orcs view humans as employers who might discard them if the political winds shift.

### Dwarven Enclaves
Skilled [[Dwarves|dwarven]] smiths and engineers from [[Hammerhall]] maintain permanent residences in Stahlburg, working the Great Forge and consulting on fortification engineering. They cluster near the Forge Quarter, maintaining their own customs while serving Thorne interests.

## Garrison

| Siege Engineers | 200 | Expert | Defense and offense |
| Iron Guard | 500 | Legendary | [[Lady Margret Thorne]]'s personal guard |
| Reserves/Training | 1,000 | Variable | Garrison support |

## Districts & Locations

### The Hall of the Fallen
A vast memorial chamber carved into the mountain, its walls inscribed with the names of every Marcher who died defending the realm. Torches burn eternally. New names are added in red, fading to gold over generations. [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] visits daily to read the most recent—her husband and eldest son among them.

### The War College
Where [[The Eastern March|the March]] trains its officers. Students learn tactics, logistics, siege craft, and the warrior philosophy that makes Marcher soldiers feared throughout the realm. Graduation requires surviving a winter campaign in the deep mountains.

### The Great Forge
The largest smithy in Eldermyr, where the [[Forgemasters Guild]] produces weapons that never break. [[Grimhild the Smith]] works here in her private forge, creating masterworks and training the next generation.

### The Warden's Shrine
A temple to the Warden aspect of [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]], where soldiers pray before battle and give thanks after. The altar is made from melted-down weapons of defeated enemies. The current High Warden, Father Aldric Iron, blesses every sword forged in the city.

### The Iron Stair
The only approach to the upper levels of the Keep. Narrow, steep, and designed so that three soldiers can hold it against an army. At its base, the Iron Gate has never been forced.

### The Widow's Walk
The highest terrace of the Keep, where [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]] stands each evening looking east toward the lands beyond the Pass—and south toward [[The Crown Lands|the Crown Lands]] she believes owe her a throne.

## Key Figures

### [[Lady Margret Thorne]]
*See [[Lady Margret Thorne]]*
[[Lady Margret Thorne]] of [[The Eastern March]]. Dying slowly but burning bright, she rules from the Keep with an iron will and an iron grudge.

### The Thorne Brothers
- **[[Ser Aldric Thorne]]** — The honorable heir, beloved by soldiers, troubled by politics
- **[[Ser Konrad Thorne]]** — The practical one, keeping the forges running and the army supplied
- **[[Ser Viktor Thorne]]** — The ambitious one, guarding the Pass while plotting something

### [[Grimhild the Smith]]
*See [[Grimhild the Smith]]*
The legendary Guildmaster, forging something unprecedented in her private workshop.

### Father Aldric Iron
High Warden of Stahlburg, he preaches that the Warden aspect of [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] demands righteous war against those who would let the realm fall to chaos. His sermons increasingly sound like calls for [[House Thorne]] to claim what blood has earned.

### Captain Ironhand
A legend in his own time. Veteran of fifty battles, missing his left hand (replaced with an iron prosthetic forged by [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] herself), he trains the next generation with brutal efficiency and genuine care.

## Economy

### Primary Industry
Iron and steel production drives everything. The Stahlfluss powers the forges; the mountains provide ore; [[The Forgemasters Guild|the Forgemasters Guild]] transforms raw metal into the finest weapons and armor in the realm. Every major house depends on Stahlburg steel.

### Trade
**Exports:** Weapons, armor, trained soldiers (mercenary companies), raw iron
**Imports:** Grain ([[The Eastern March|the March]] cannot feed itself), luxury goods (rare), skilled craftsmen

### The Iron Tax
Every weapon sold carries a surcharge that funds [[The Eastern March]]'s defenses. In times of war, this "Iron Tax" can triple, making [[House Thorne]] wealthy—and making their customers resentful.

## Secrets

1. **[[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]]'s Timeline.** The Wardeness has perhaps a year to live. Her urgency to see a Thorne on the throne is personal—she wants to die knowing her sacrifices meant something.

2. **The Deep Forge.** Beneath the Great Forge, sealed chambers contain weapons and armor from before the realm unified. Some of it is magical. All of it is forbidden to use without the Wardeness's express command.

3. **[[Ser Viktor Thorne|Viktor]]'s Correspondence.** [[Ser Viktor Thorne|Ser Viktor]] has been corresponding with [[House Valdren]]—and with someone beyond the Ostmark Pass. His mother doesn't know. Yet.

4. **The Old Passages.** The mountain is riddled with tunnels predating [[House Thorne]]. Some connect to the surface miles away. Others lead... deeper.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Dying Wardeness:** [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]]'s illness is accelerating. She needs someone to investigate whether it's natural—or whether someone is hastening her end.

2. **The Deep Forge:** Something stirs in the sealed chambers. [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] heard sounds. She needs trustworthy investigators who can keep secrets.

3. **[[Ser Viktor Thorne|Viktor]]'s Secret:** Someone knows about [[Ser Viktor Thorne|Viktor]]'s correspondence. They're blackmailing him—or trying to recruit him for something worse.

4. **Beyond the Pass:** [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] needs materials from the foreign lands for her masterwork. The party could make the journey—if [[Ser Viktor Thorne|Viktor]] permits passage.

5. **The War College Challenge:** A foreign dignitary has challenged [[The Eastern March|the March]] to produce champions for a trial by combat. The stakes are higher than anyone admits.
