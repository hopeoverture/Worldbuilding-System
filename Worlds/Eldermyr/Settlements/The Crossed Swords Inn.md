# The Crossed Swords Inn

## Overview
The Crossed Swords is [[Eldoria]]'s most famous adventurer's tavern—a neutral ground where sellswords, mercenaries, and fortune-seekers gather to drink, brag, and find work. Run by [[Old Marta]], a retired adventurer with a sharp tongue and sharper memory, it's one of the few places in the city where faction colors are checked at the door. The food is honest, the ale is strong, and the only currency that matters is proven capability.

## Classification

### Type
**Establishment Type:** Inn and Tavern

**Quality:** Modest (deliberately so—Old Marta says fancy attracts trouble)

### Location
**Settlement:** [[Eldoria]]

**District:** The Common Quarters

**Street/Address:** Sword Lane, near the eastern market

### Reputation
**Known For:** Neutral ground, adventurer clientele, Old Marta's judgment of character

**Local Perception:** Honest establishment; dangerous clientele; safe if you mind your manners

## Exterior

### Building
**Architecture:** Three-story timber and stone, built for durability rather than beauty

**Condition:** Well-maintained; Old Marta keeps things working

**Stories:** Three (common room, kitchen, and storage below; guest rooms on two upper floors)

### Signage
**Sign Description:** Two crossed swords over a wooden shield, the blades notched from actual combat—Old Marta's own weapons from her adventuring days

**Sign Meaning:** "Warriors welcome; trouble isn't"

### Entrance
**Description:** Heavy oak door, iron-banded, with a viewing slot at eye level

**First Impression:** The door opens to warmth, noise, and the smell of cooking meat—a promise of shelter for those who've earned it

## Interior Layout

### Common Room
**Size:** Large (60 capacity comfortably, 80 packed tight)

**Seating Capacity:** 15 tables of various sizes, plus bar seating for 10

**Description:**
The common room is a monument to practical hospitality. Smoke-darkened beams support a ceiling festooned with trophies from Marta's adventuring days—a demon's horns, a troll's jawbone, the tattered banner of a defeated mercenary company. The stone floor is worn smooth by decades of boots, scattered with sawdust that's changed daily. A massive fireplace dominates one wall, large enough to roast a whole pig and frequently doing so. The air is thick with the smell of cooking food, spilled ale, and the particular musk of people who work dangerous jobs.

**Notable Features:**
- Marta's trophy wall behind the bar
- The "Job Board" near the door where contracts are posted
- The "Troublemaker's Corner" where problem customers are seated where everyone can watch them

### Bar/Counter

**What's Displayed:** Marta's trophy collection, including a desiccated beholder eye that may or may not be real

### Kitchen & Storage

**Storage:** Dry goods, ale barrels, emergency weapons cache

## Proprietor

### Description
*See: [[Old Marta]]*

**Name:** Marta Blackblade

**Race/Species:** Human

**Age:** 63

**Appearance:**
Old Marta is built like a barrel—short, broad, and seemingly impossible to tip over. Her grey hair is cropped short and practical, her face a map of scars and laugh lines in equal measure. She moves with the deliberate care of someone whose joints ache but whose reflexes haven't forgotten old training. Her eyes are sharp blue and miss nothing that happens in her establishment.

### Personality
**Demeanor:** Gruff, practical, and unsentimental—with a heart of gold she'd deny having

**With Customers:** Direct to the point of rudeness; those she likes get the same treatment, just with smaller insults

**With Trouble:** Cold and efficient; she's removed plenty of bodies in her time

### Background
Marta adventured for thirty years, retired wealthy enough to buy the Crossed Swords, and has run it for twenty more. She's buried friends, made enemies, and collected stories. Every regular has heard at least one tale of her exploits; none has heard them all.

### Secrets
- She maintains a network of retired adventurers throughout [[Eldoria]] who trade information
- The cellar has a hidden room where she's hidden political refugees—for the right price or the right cause
- She knows where several legendary artifacts ended up after jobs went wrong

### Daily Routine
**Morning:** Up before dawn; supervises breakfast prep; reviews accounts

**Peak Hours:** Behind the bar or circulating; keeps order by presence alone

## History

### Founding
The Crossed Swords was built sixty years ago as a coaching inn. Marta bought it twenty years ago with the proceeds of her last adventure and transformed it into its current incarnation.

### Previous Owners
| Owner | Era | Notable Events |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| Thomas Holden | 60-20 years ago | Built as coaching inn |
| Old Marta | 20 years ago-present | Transformed into adventurer's hub |

### Notable Events
1. **The Night of Twenty Swords:** A mercenary company tried to force Marta to spy for them; she and her regulars fought them off. The trophy wall gained several additions.
2. **The Treaty of the Crossed Swords:** Two rival adventuring companies settled a blood feud here under Marta's arbitration. The tradition of neutral ground began.

### Current Era
The succession crisis has been good for business—more adventurers seeking work, more factions hiring them, more need for neutral meeting ground. Marta worries that the neutrality won't survive if things get worse.

## Secrets

1. The cellar contains a hidden room accessible through a barrel trap door—Marta has hidden refugees, criminals, and nobles there over the years
2. Old Marta knows [[Lady Whisper]]'s real name from forty years ago, but they have an understanding
3. The "decorative" weapons on the walls are all functional and positioned for quick access—Marta has repelled three robbery attempts this way

## Plot Hooks

1. A posting on the Job Board leads to a legitimate adventure that turns political
2. Someone breaks the neutrality rule in a spectacular way—Marta needs help handling it
3. A figure from Marta's past arrives with a debt to collect or a secret to reveal
4. The hidden room is needed for someone important, but powerful people want them found

### Common Room Interior
**Prompt:**
The common room of the Crossed Swords Inn on a busy evening, where adventurers gather between jobs and fortunes are made over tankards of ale. A low-ceilinged room of smoke-darkened oak beams and time-worn stone, the great fireplace blazing at the far end with flames dancing on logs thick as a man's arm—the warmth reaching every corner while regulars guard the closest seats. Tables of different sizes and ages scattered across the sawdust-covered floor, scarred by countless knives and ale rings, some carved with initials and crude symbols, each one telling stories of celebrations and sorrows past. The bar runs along one wall, oak planks worn smooth by decades of elbows, the back wall a trophy collection that doubles as a warning—the horns of a demon, the jawbone of a troll, tattered banners of defeated enemies, weapons that have drawn blood. Behind the bar, a broad, grey-haired woman (Old Marta) wipes a glass while watching everything with sharp eyes that miss nothing. A half-orc bouncer stands by the door, massive and patient. The patrons are a mix of rough-looking adventurers, scarred mercenaries, and merchants seeking protection—some hunched over private conversations, others laughing loudly at war stories, a group in one corner examining a contract by candlelight. Weapons hang at hips and across backs; this is a room where everyone is armed and everyone knows it. Near the door, a board covered with posted notices—the famous Job Board where fortunes begin. Candles and oil lamps cast warm, uneven light, leaving shadows in the corners where deals are made. The atmosphere is warmth, danger, and rough camaraderie—a sanctuary for those who work with steel. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on aged wood and adventurer's equipment, dramatic atmosphere of dangerous fellowship, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy adventurer's tavern common room illustration.

## Notes
The Crossed Swords serves as the classic adventurer's hub—a place for players to find quests, hear rumors, meet contacts, and establish themselves in [[Eldoria]]. Its neutrality makes it valuable in the factional conflict; breaking that neutrality would be a significant story event.
