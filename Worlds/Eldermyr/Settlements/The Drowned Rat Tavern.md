# The Drowned Rat Tavern

## Overview
The Drowned Rat is the kind of establishment respectable citizens pretend doesn't exist—a dockside dive where smugglers drink with sailors, where contraband changes hands under the table, and where the Valdren blockade is more suggestion than law. Run by [[Saltbeard Pete]], a former smuggler himself, it's the beating heart of [[Eldoria]]'s maritime underworld. The ale is cheap, the clientele is dangerous, and the city Watch knows better than to come alone.

## Classification

### Type
**Establishment Type:** Tavern (no lodging by official policy—though arrangements can be made)

**Quality:** Poor (intentionally so—keeps the wrong people out)

### Location
**Settlement:** [[Eldoria]]

**District:** The Docks

**Street/Address:** Anchor Street, where it dead-ends at the old sea wall

### Reputation
**Known For:** Smuggler connections, black market contacts, no questions asked

**Local Perception:** Dangerous but useful; the Watch raids it occasionally for show, never finds anything

## Exterior

### Building
**Architecture:** Ancient stone warehouse converted to tavern; leaning noticeably toward the water

**Condition:** Deliberately decrepit-looking; actually sound enough to survive a century more

**Stories:** Two (common room and back rooms below; private rooms above)

### Signage
**Sign Description:** A carved wooden rat, waterlogged and grey, hanging from a rusty hook

**Sign Meaning:** "This is exactly what it looks like"

### Entrance
**Description:** Heavy door with no windows; opens outward (harder to kick in)

**First Impression:** The smell hits you first—salt, fish, sweat, and the particular musk of people who don't explain their business

## Interior Layout

### Common Room
**Size:** Medium (40 capacity, always feels crowded)

**Seating Capacity:** 10 tables, mostly small; a long bar with no stools (standing only)

**Description:**
The Drowned Rat's common room is as inviting as its clientele—rough plank floors stained by decades of spilled drinks and worse, walls dark with smoke and mold, rafters festooned with old fishing nets and mysteriously unidentifiable hanging objects. The bar is a massive piece of ship timber, scarred by knives and burns, behind which Pete presides like a captain on his quarterdeck. Candles provide the only light—enough to see your drink, not enough to see faces clearly. The back wall has three doors, each leading somewhere customers aren't supposed to discuss.

**Notable Features:**
- The "Admiral's Corner"—a private booth with its own entrance to the back alley
- A trapdoor behind the bar that Pete claims leads to the cellar (it doesn't)
- Nets on the ceiling that have concealed more than fish

### Bar/Counter
**Description:** Ship timber salvaged from a wreck; carved with countless sailor's marks

**What's Displayed:** Bottles of various quality, a stuffed rat of unusual size, a rusted harpoon

### Kitchen & Storage
**Kitchen Quality:** Barely functional; serves cold food and fish stew

**Cellar:** Has one—it connects to tunnels that reach the waterline

**Storage:** Multiple hidden compartments for goods that shouldn't exist

### Private Rooms
| Room | Capacity | Cost | Features |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| Admiral's Corner | 4 | 1 gp | Private entrance, conversation-proof |
| The Hold | 8 | 2 gp | Underground room for larger deals |

### Guest Rooms
| Room Type | Count | Cost/Night | Amenities |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Hammock space | 6 spots | 2 sp | A hammock; nothing else |
| "The Captain's Cabin" | 1 | 5 sp | Actual bed; door that locks |

### Other Areas
**Stables:** None (but boat moorings out back)

**Courtyard:** A dock extending into the harbor, for private arrivals

**Other:** Tunnel access to the smuggler's network beneath the Docks

## Atmosphere

### Ambiance
**Lighting:** Candles only; deliberately dim

**Sounds:** Low conversation, the creak of ships, the slap of water against stone

**Smells:** Salt, fish, wet wood, spilled ale, and things better not identified

**Temperature:** Cold and damp; the sea never lets you forget where you are

### Typical Crowd
**Busy Hours:** After midnight; when honest sailors are asleep

**Slow Hours:** Daylight (the Rat barely wakes before sunset)

**Typical Patrons:** Smugglers, sailors between ships, fences, information brokers, people who need to disappear

### Entertainment
| Entertainment | Frequency | Performer/Type |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Gambling | Constant | Cards, dice, and stranger games |
| Shanties | Occasional | Drunk sailors |
| Fights | Too frequent | Amateur violence |

### House Rules
- No Watch welcome (they'll get out alive if they leave immediately)
- What happens here doesn't get discussed
- Pete's word is final
- Pay your debts or swim home

## Proprietor

### Description
*See: [[Saltbeard Pete]]*

**Name:** Piotr "Saltbeard Pete" Markov

**Race/Species:** Human

**Age:** 58

**Appearance:**
Pete looks exactly like what he is—a former smuggler gone to seed. His beard is grey and stiff with salt despite not having been to sea in a decade. His face is weathered leather, his eyes permanently squinting from too many years watching horizons. He's missing two fingers on his left hand (he tells a different story each time someone asks) and walks with a rolling gait that never adapted to solid ground.

### Personality
**Demeanor:** Rough, cynical, and surprisingly fair in his crooked way

**With Customers:** Doesn't talk much; remembers everything

**With Trouble:** Has a sawed-off crossbow under the bar and knows how to use it

### Background
Pete smuggled for twenty years before the revenue cutters got too close one too many times. He bought the Drowned Rat with his accumulated savings and now facilitates rather than participates. He knows everyone in the maritime underworld and has never betrayed a customer—bad for business.

### Secrets
- He knows every smuggler route around the Valdren blockade
- The [[Dock Runners]] organization pays him for information and protection
- He's been passing intelligence to multiple factions, playing them against each other for profit

### Daily Routine
**Morning:** Sleeps (if he's not passed out behind the bar)

**Peak Hours:** Behind the bar from sunset to dawn, watching everything

**Closing:** Doesn't really close; just gets quieter near dawn

| Old Bones | Cook | Skeletal old man | Makes the fish stew that's kept people alive for decades |

### Notable Staff Member
**Name:** Fishbone Jenny

**Role:** Server and information gatherer

**Description:** A thin, nervous-looking woman whose hands move too fast for honest work. She hears everything, remembers most of it, and sells it to Pete.

**Secret:** She reports to [[Lady Whisper]] as well as Pete; neither knows about the other

## Business Operations

### Ownership
**Owner:** [[Saltbeard Pete]], outright

### Revenue

### Competitors
**Main Rivals:** None in this niche—the Drowned Rat has no real competition

**Competitive Advantage:** Location, connections, Pete's neutrality

### Legal Issues
Constant but never serious—the Watch knows better than to look too hard

### Protection
**Security:** Scar the bouncer; Pete's crossbow; the understanding that harming the Rat is bad for business

**Criminal Ties:** Deep and extensive; the Rat is neutral ground for the underworld

## History

### Founding
The building has been a tavern for over a century, changing hands and names many times. Pete bought it fifteen years ago with the intention of going straight; the straight life didn't suit him.

### Previous Owners
| Owner | Era | Notable Events |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| Various | Ancient | Changed hands regularly |
| "Honest" Joen | 15-30 years ago | Genuinely tried to run it straight; failed |
| Pete | 15 years ago-present | Made it what it is today |

### Notable Events
1. **The Night the Watch Tried:** A raid that went badly wrong; three watchmen drowned in the harbor; nobody saw anything
2. **The Blockade Celebration:** When the blockade was announced, the Rat had its busiest night in years

### Current Era
The blockade has been excellent for business. Smuggling is more profitable than ever, and the Drowned Rat has become the hub of a thriving black market economy. Pete has never been busier—or more valuable to multiple factions.

## Secrets

1. The tunnels beneath the Rat connect to a network that runs throughout the Docks—used for smuggling, hiding people, and things worse
2. Pete is paid by both [[House Valdren]] (to report on blockade runners) and the Dock Runners (to facilitate them); he gives each what they want to hear
3. The "Admiral's Corner" has hidden passages to both the tunnels and the roof—it's an escape room as much as a meeting room

## Plot Hooks

1. A contact at the Rat has information about the hidden heir—but they need extraction before they'll talk
2. Something in the tunnels has started killing smugglers; the survivors won't go back
3. A faction wants to shut down the Rat's neutrality; Pete needs help maintaining it
4. A shipment that was supposed to come through has gone missing—and it contained something important

### Common Room Interior
**Prompt:**
The common room of the Drowned Rat Tavern in the dark hours after midnight, where the city's maritime underworld conducts its business in shadows and whispers. A low, cramped space in what was once a warehouse, the walls stained dark with smoke and sea-damp, the ceiling hung with old fishing nets that might conceal anything. Rough plank floors scarred by decades of spilled drinks, blood, and things better not identified. The bar is a massive timber salvaged from a wrecked ship, carved with countless sailors' marks and burns, behind which a weathered man with a grey salt-stiff beard presides like a captain who never left his ship. The only light comes from tallow candles stuck in bottles, their flames guttering in the draft from the sea—enough to see your drink, not enough to see faces clearly. The patrons are rough-looking sailors, men and women who don't explain their business, their conversations kept deliberately low. Shadowy booths along the walls, one with its own curtained entrance. A door to the back that's always watched. The smell of salt, fish, sweat, cheap ale, and the particular musk of people who move goods that shouldn't be moved. Through a gap in the shuttered windows, the gleam of harbor water and the dark shapes of ships at anchor. The atmosphere is danger and opportunity in equal measure—a place where questions aren't asked and answers are sold. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, dim candlelight with deep shadows, rich textures on weathered wood and rough-hewn stone, dramatic atmosphere of maritime underworld, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition. Fantasy smuggler's tavern interior illustration.

## Notes
The Drowned Rat serves as the players' entry point to [[Eldoria]]'s criminal underworld and smuggling network. It's the opposite of the Crossed Swords—where that inn maintains honest neutrality, the Rat maintains criminal neutrality. It's ideal for shady contacts, black market needs, and information about what's really happening beneath the surface.
