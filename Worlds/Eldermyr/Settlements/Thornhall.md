# Thornhall

## Overview
Thornhall is where faith becomes stone. Three great spires rise above the holy city—one for each aspect of [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]—their bells calling the faithful to prayer five times daily. Pilgrims from across the realm journey here to receive blessings, seek healing, or find forgiveness. The Great Cathedral dominates the skyline, and the Synod's word in matters spiritual is law. But beneath the sacred calm, something stirs. [[High Confessor Maren]] receives visions he believes divine. [[The Grey Wardens]] whisper of crisis. And deep in the sealed catacombs, something ancient is waking.

## Geography

### Location
Thornhall sits on sacred ground in the heart of [[The Crown Lands]], two days' ride from [[Aldersgate]]. Legend says [[The Faith of the Three]] first manifested here in the Age of Myth, leaving their mark upon the land. The city grew around that holy site, and the Great Cathedral now stands where divine feet supposedly touched mortal earth.

### Sacred Geography
The city is built on three hills—one for each aspect of [[The Faith of the Three]]. The Warden's Hill rises highest in the east, crowned by the Great Cathedral. The Shepherd's Hill in the west holds the Sanctuary of Mercy. The Chronicler's Hill to [[The Northlands]] houses the Grey Bastion, headquarters of [[The Grey Wardens]].

### Climate
The same temperate weather as [[The Crown Lands|the Crown Lands]], but pilgrims swear the air feels purer here, the light more golden. Skeptics note the city's excellent drainage and the sweet herbs planted everywhere by temple gardeners.

## Layout

### [[The Faith of the Three|The Three]] Hills

## [[The Faith of the Three]]

### Religious Hierarchy
Thornhall is the seat of [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s central authority:

**The High Confessor:** [[High Confessor Maren]], the supreme religious authority
**The Synod:** Twelve High Priests representing different aspects and regions
**[[The Faith of the Three|The Three]] Orders:**
- The Warden's Judges (justice and law)
- The Shepherd's Healers (mercy and care)
- The Chronicler's Wardens (death and memory)

### The Synod
The governing council of [[The Faith of the Three]] meets in Thornhall. Twelve seats represent [[The Faith of the Three]] aspects and the realm's major regions. The High Confessor presides but theoretically cannot overrule a unified Synod. In practice, [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]'s visions have given him unprecedented influence.

### Daily Worship
The cathedral bells ring five times daily, calling the faithful:
- Dawn (the Warden's Hour)
- Mid-morning (the Shepherd's Hour)
- Noon ([[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]'s Hour)
- Evening (the Chronicler's Hour)
- Midnight (the Silent Hour, bells ring but no service—remembrance of the dead)

## Notable Locations

### The Great Cathedral of [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]
The largest religious structure in Eldermyr. Three spires rise from a central structure—the Warden's Spire (tallest), the Shepherd's Spire (widest), and the Chronicler's Spire (darkest). The interior can hold ten thousand worshippers. The altar sits where [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] supposedly manifested.

### The Sanctuary of Mercy
The realm's greatest hospital, run by the Shepherd's order. Healing happens here that borders on the miraculous—or perhaps is miraculous. Sister Elspeth's counterpart here, Mother Agatha, has healed wounds that should have been fatal.

### The Grey Bastion
Headquarters of the [[Grey Wardens]], the order that ensures the dead rest peacefully. [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]] commands from here, though he spends most of his time at [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]. The Bastion houses the order's archives, training facilities, and the entrance to the sealed catacombs.

### The Sacred Archives
Where [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s records are kept—histories, doctrines, theological texts, and... other things. Certain sections are restricted. Certain sections are sealed. Certain sections don't officially exist.

### The Sealed Catacombs
Beneath Chronicler's Hill, ancient tunnels predate [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]. They were sealed centuries ago when monks discovered something that shouldn't exist. Recently, sounds have been heard from below.

### The Palace of Grace
The High Confessor's residence. [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]] spends long hours in his private chapel, communing with what he believes are [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]. His attendants note he barely sleeps anymore. The golden ring in his eyes grows more visible.

## Key Figures

### [[High Confessor Maren]]
*See [[High Confessor Maren]]*
The supreme religious authority, receiving visions he believes divine. He believes the succession crisis can only be resolved through Faith's guidance—his guidance. Something is wrong with his eyes.

### [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]]
*See [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane]]*
Based in the Grey Bastion when not at [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]]. He knows something terrible is happening to the dead. He suspects something is also happening to the High Confessor.

### Mother Agatha
High Healer of the Sanctuary, elderly and beloved. She's seen miracles. She's also seen horrors. She quietly gathers evidence that [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]'s visions are not what he thinks they are.

### Archpriest Corvan
Leader of the Warden's Judges, [[The Faith of the Three]]'s legal arm. A hard man who believes in strict interpretation of religious law. He supports [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]'s claim to guide the succession—[[The Faith of the Three]] should rule.

### Brother Corvus
[[The Grey Wardens]]' archivist. Brilliant, obsessive, and concerning. He knows things about the sealed catacombs that he shouldn't. His loyalty is to knowledge, not to any faction.

### Sister Helena
A young priestess who tends the Memorial of Names. She's been hearing whispers from the catacombs. She's told no one. She's not sure they'd believe her.

## Economy

### Pilgrim Economy
Thornhall runs on faith—literally. Pilgrims bring offerings, purchase religious goods, pay for healing and blessings, and support an entire economy of devotion. The city produces little of material value but controls something more important: spiritual legitimacy.

### Religious Crafts
- Sacred candles blessed by priests
- Icons and reliquaries
- Ceremonial vestments
- Copies of holy texts
- Pilgrim tokens and souvenirs

### Healing Trade
The Sanctuary of Mercy heals those who can pay and those who cannot—but those who can pay contribute significantly to Faith coffers. Healing that would cost a fortune elsewhere is provided for "appropriate donations."

## Defense

### [[The Grey Wardens]]
The primary military force in Thornhall is [[The Grey Wardens|the Grey Wardens]]—approximately 300 warriors sworn to the Chronicler. They're monster hunters, not soldiers, but they're very good at what they do.

### The Temple Guard
Perhaps 1,200 guards protect the city's temples and maintain order. They're adequate peacekeepers but would struggle against a real military force. [[The Faith of the Three|The Faith]] relies on its sacred status for protection.

### Sacred Defense
No army would attack Thornhall. The political cost would be catastrophic—the entire realm would unite against anyone who desecrated the holy city. This is [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s true defense: not walls, but belief.

## Secrets

1. **The Catacombs contain something ancient.** Predating [[The Faith of the Three]], predating the realm—something was buried here and [[The Faith of the Three]] built their holiest city on top to keep it contained. Recent disturbances suggest containment is failing.

2. **[[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]'s visions are corrupted.** Something is speaking to the High Confessor, but it's not [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]. The golden ring in his eyes is a sign of influence from... elsewhere. A faction within the Synod suspects but can't prove it.

3. **The Great Cathedral contains a weapon.** A relic in the deepest vault could end the rising dead—but using it would reveal that [[The Faith of the Three]] has lied about the nature of [[The Faith of the Three]] for centuries.

4. **[[The Grey Wardens]] are divided.** [[Grandmaster Aldric Greymane|Greymane]] pushes for action; Brother Corvus argues for more knowledge; others want to petition the Synod. While they debate, the dead continue to rise.

5. **A second High Confessor waits.** Archpriest Corvan believes [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]] is compromised. He's quietly building support for a challenge. If [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]] is removed, Corvan would claim the title—and he's just as dangerous, only differently.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Voice Below:** Sister Helena seeks help understanding the whispers from the catacombs. What she's hearing might be a warning—or an invitation.

2. **The Hidden Relic:** Mother Agatha knows about the weapon in the vault. She needs allies to reach it—allies outside [[The Faith of the Three|the Faith]]'s compromised hierarchy.

3. **The High Confessor's Madness:** Someone must prove that [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]'s visions are false. The evidence is in his private chapel—but getting there requires infiltrating the most sacred ground in the realm.

4. **The Grey Archive:** Brother Corvus has documents about what's sealed below. He'll share them—for a price. The price is helping him open a door that should stay closed.

5. **The Schism:** Archpriest Corvan recruits outsiders to gather evidence against [[High Confessor Maren|Maren]]. But Corvan's own agenda may be as dangerous as the High Confessor's corruption.
