# Thornholt

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a stronghold, create a fortified military structure designed for defense, control, or projection of power. Focus on tactical details, defensive features, garrison composition, and strategic importance.

## Overview
Thornholt is the iron heart of the Eastern March—a fortress-town where military discipline governs every aspect of life. Built atop the artificial Warden's Tor, the citadel of [[House Thorne]] commands the most productive farmland in Eldermyr and guards the approaches to [[The Iron Gate Pass]]. For generations, the Thornes have ruled from these walls, breeding the finest war horses, training the deadliest soldiers, and feeding the kingdom from their fields. In the succession crisis, Thornholt has become a power unto itself—whoever holds the grain holds the realm.

## Classification

### Stronghold Type
**Type:** Fortress-Town (citadel with walled settlement)

**Primary Purpose:** Defense / Regional Control / Military Hub

**Age:** Original fortress 400 years; continuous expansion since

**Condition:** Well-Maintained (military precision)

## Geography

### Location
Thornholt rises from [[The Warden's March]], centered on the Warden's Tor—an artificial hill raised by generations of labor to elevate the citadel above the surrounding plains. From the tower tops, watchmen can see the [[The Ostmark Range|Ostmark Range]] to the east, the forests of [[The Thornwood]] to the north, and endless grain fields in every other direction. [[The King's Road]] passes through the town, making it the gateway between the capital and the eastern frontier.

### Approaches
- **Primary:** The King's Road from west (Eldoria) and east (toward Iron Gate)
- **Secondary:** The Warden's Way military road to the north
- **Difficulty:** Easy approach across open plains—but under observation for miles
- **Defense:** No cover for attackers; garrison can see enemies long before arrival

### Climate & Environment
Continental climate with cold winters and hot summers. The open plains channel winds that whistle through the streets. Snow blankets the town in winter; summer heat bakes the training yards. The fortress's elevation exposes it to weather but provides unmatched visibility.

## Fortifications

### Outer Defenses
- Cleared kill zone for 500 yards around town walls
- Watch posts on major roads (5-mile intervals)
- Ditches and stakes on non-road approaches
- The Warden's Tor adds 200 feet of elevation to the citadel

### Walls
**Town Walls:**
- **Construction:** Stone and timber hybrid
- **Height:** 25 feet
- **Thickness:** 8 feet

### Towers
- **Number:** 24 (town), 8 (citadel)
- **Types:** Square towers on town walls; round towers on citadel
- **Height:** 40-80 feet
- **Armament:** Ballistae on citadel towers; crossbow positions throughout

### Gates
**Main Gate (Town):**
- The King's Gate: massive iron-bound doors, twin towers, portcullis, murder holes
- Two guardrooms, always manned by 20 soldiers
- Inspects all traffic on King's Road

**Citadel Gate:**
- Single narrow entrance up the Tor
- Three successive gates with killing grounds between
- Drawbridge over final gap

**Secondary Entrances:**

## Strategic Role

### Purpose
Thornholt exists to defend Eldermyr's eastern border and control its agricultural heartland. The fortress guards the approaches to the Iron Gate Pass, serves as the mustering point for eastern armies, and ensures the grain harvest flows to the realm. Lord Thorne's control of this chokepoint makes him kingmaker in the succession crisis.

### Tactical Value
**Defensive Value:** Critical (cannot be bypassed)
**Offensive Value:** High (cavalry projection)
**Control Value:** Critical (grain production)

### Supply & Logistics
- Surrounded by the most productive farmland in Eldermyr
- Grain stores for 6+ months even under siege
- Horsemeat available as emergency rations
- Water from deep wells; independent of external supply
- Vulnerability: None significant (self-sufficient)

### Communication
- Signal tower network across the March
- Rider messengers (fast cavalry)
- Mirror signals to Watch Line forts
- Response time: Regional forces can muster in 48 hours

## Command & Control

### Controlling Power
**Faction/Nation:** House Thorne / Eldermyr (nominal)
**Direct Superior:** Theoretically the Crown; currently autonomous
**Autonomy Level:** Very High (acts independently)
**Political Importance:** Critical (grain leverage)

### Chain of Command
- Lord Thorne commands absolutely
- Reports to Crown (ignored during crisis)
- Captain Brennan is heir and successor
- The March Council advises but doesn't command

### Laws & Discipline
- Military law applies to soldiers
- Civil law for townspeople (but harsh)
- Punishments: flogging, imprisonment, execution for serious crimes
- Prisoners used for labor; dungeons rarely empty
- Justice is swift and certain

## History

### Construction
The original fortress was built 400 years ago when the Thornes were granted the Eastern March to defend. Each generation expanded the defenses, raised the Tor higher, and strengthened the walls. The current citadel represents four centuries of military engineering—a fortress that has never fallen.

### Battles & Sieges
1. **The Battle of Three Farms (120 years ago):**
   - Rival noble houses attempted to seize the March
   - Lord Aldric I crushed them in the fields
   - Established Thorne dominance permanently

2. **The Ankheg Summer (80 years ago):**
   - Massive creature emergence threatened the March
   - Garrison fought desperate defense
   - Established the monster-watch protocols

3. **The Harvest Rebellion (45 years ago):**
   - Peasant uprising against excessive levies
   - Crushed by cavalry; reforms followed
   - Current Lord Aldric's first command

### Famous Defenders/Commanders
- Lord Aldric I (established Thorne power)
- Lady Elena the Shield (defended against three sieges)
- General Stern (survived Ankheg Summer)
- Current Lord Aldric (respected commander)

### Current Situation
Thornholt sits at the center of the succession crisis, not through fighting but through leverage. Lord Thorne has not committed his forces to either faction, instead using grain shipments as bargaining chips. Both sides court him desperately. Meanwhile, [[Risen Soldier]] incursions from [[The Karath Reach]] test the southern border, and something stirs beyond the Iron Gate.

## Threats & Concerns

### External Threats
- [[Risen Soldier]] incursions from the south
- Pressure from both succession factions
- Unknown activity beyond the Iron Gate
- Ankheg emergence cycles

### Internal Threats
- Some officers favor different factions
- Morale strain from prolonged neutrality
- Grain withholding creates enemy sympathizers
- Lady Thorne's independent dealings

### Weaknesses
1. Lord Thorne's health is declining (kept secret)
2. The southern border is overextended
3. Captain Brennan may act rashly if father dies

## Secrets

1. Lord Thorne has a secret agreement with Commander Stone at the Iron Gate—if something breaks through, Thornholt's cavalry will ride to reinforce, regardless of politics
2. The Thorne family vault contains evidence that their claim to the March was based on forged documents 400 years ago—exposure would delegitimize their rule
3. Lady Mira Thorne has been promised that her second son will marry the claimant's daughter—from BOTH factions; her scheming could destroy the family

## Plot Hooks

1. Lord Thorne secretly hires the party to investigate the Risen incursions—he suspects someone is directing them, not just random attacks
2. A messenger arrives from the Iron Gate with word that something has been spotted beyond—Lord Thorne needs scouts who aren't his own soldiers
3. Someone has stolen documents from the family vault; the party must recover them before the forgery is exposed
4. Lady Thorne contacts the party privately—she needs leverage against her husband's stubbornness
5. The ankheg emergence is early this year; the party must help clear tunnels before the harvest is destroyed

## Tactical Notes

### Defensive Advantages
- Elevated position (Warden's Tor)
- Clear sight lines in all directions
- Elite garrison with high morale
- Self-sufficient for extended siege

### Defensive Disadvantages
- Prominence makes it a target
- Cavalry less effective in siege defense
- Town walls weaker than citadel
- Cannot protect all surrounding farmland

### Siege Duration
Could hold indefinitely with access to fields; 6+ months even fully besieged

### Capture Methods
Direct assault nearly impossible. Would require overwhelming force, starvation (difficult given farmland), treachery (bribery/infiltration), or eliminating Lord Thorne.

## Notes
Thornholt is the military heart of Eldermyr—not the largest or wealthiest settlement, but the most martial. Adventures here involve military themes: duty, honor, strategy, and the cost of war. Lord Thorne's careful neutrality creates opportunities for intrigue, while the external threats (Risen, ankhegs, Iron Gate mysteries) provide action.
