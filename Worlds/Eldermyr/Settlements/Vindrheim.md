# Vindrheim

## Overview
Vindrheim is the largest settlement in [[The Northlands]], serving as the primary trading hub where goods from the ancient forests meet merchants from the south. Built where the Vindra River meets the Northern Way road, the town is a gathering place for trappers, loggers, and those who still follow [[The Spirit-Speakers|the Old Ways]]. While nominally loyal to the crown, Vindrheim has always governed itself through a council of elders, and the succession crisis in the south concerns them less than the changing of the seasons.

## Geography

### Location
Vindrheim sits at the confluence of the Vindra River and the Northern Way, the main road connecting [[The Northlands]] to [[Aldersgate]] and the rest of the realm. The town is built on both banks of the river, connected by an ancient stone bridge that predates the current settlement.

### Terrain
Dense pine forest surrounds the town on three sides, with the river providing the main avenue of travel. The land is flat but rises into forested hills to the north. Winter comes early here and stays late.

### Climate
Cold and harsh. Winters last six months, with deep snow and bitter winds. Summers are brief but beautiful, with long days and mild temperatures. The locals have adapted to this cycle completely.

## Layout

### The Old Town
The original settlement on the west bank, containing the Council Hall, the oldest homes, and the shrine to the Old Ways where [[The Spirit-Speakers|Spirit-Speakers]] still commune with ancestors.

### The Market Quarter
The east bank, dominated by the great Market Square where traders gather. Warehouses line the waterfront, storing goods waiting for transport south.

### The Forestgate
The northern edge of town, where loggers and trappers enter with their goods. Simple lodging houses and taverns cater to these workers.

## Demographics

### Population
**Total:** ~8,000 (swells to 12,000 during summer trade season)
**Density:** Moderate (spread along the riverbanks)

### Peoples
| Group | Percentage | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Northfolk | 80% | Original inhabitants |
| Southern merchants | 15% | Seasonal or permanent traders |
| Others | 5% | Travelers, outcasts |

## Government

### The Council of Elders
Vindrheim is ruled by a council of seven elders, each representing a different aspect of town life: trade, fishing, logging, hunting, crafts, spiritual matters, and defense. Decisions require consensus. The current head elder is Thora Windwhisper, a [[The Spirit-Speakers|Spirit-Speaker]] who has led the council for twenty years.

### Relationship with the Crown
Vindrheim acknowledges the crown's authority and pays taxes, but royal officials rarely visit. The town governs itself and prefers it that way.

## Economy

### Trade Hub
Everything from [[The Northlands]] passes through Vindrheim—furs, timber, amber, herbs, and more exotic goods from deeper in the forests. Southern merchants bring metal goods, cloth, weapons, and luxuries.

### Industries
- **Fur trade:** The primary source of wealth
- **Timber:** The forests provide endless wood
- **Fishing:** The Vindra is rich with fish
- **Brewing:** Northern mead is famous throughout the realm

## Culture

### The Old Ways
[[The Faith of the Three]] has a presence here—there's a small temple to the Shepherd—but many Northfolk still follow the Old Ways. [[The Spirit-Speakers]] are respected community leaders. Ancestor shrines dot the town. The two traditions coexist uneasily.

### Traditions
- **Midwinter Gathering:** When the days are shortest, the whole town gathers for a week of feasting, storytelling, and remembrance
- **First Thaw:** Celebration when the river ice breaks, marking the return of trade season
- **The Silent Night:** One night each year when no one speaks, honoring the dead

## Notable Locations

### The Council Hall
A great wooden longhouse where the elders meet. Ancient carvings on its walls depict the founding of the town and the spirits of the land.

### The Stone Bridge
Older than the town itself, this bridge is said to have been built by giants. It has never needed repair.

### The Spirit Grove
Just outside town, a sacred grove where [[The Spirit-Speakers]] perform their rituals. Outsiders are not welcome.

### The Frozen Tankard
The largest tavern in town, famous for its mead and as a gathering place for traders and adventurers.
