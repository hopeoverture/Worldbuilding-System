# Volkovka

## Overview
Volkovka is what survives. Once a prosperous fishing village on the Bitter Coast, it has swelled with refugees from the blighted inland, becoming the Karath Reach's last functional settlement outside Chernogrod. The fishing is still good—the curse hasn't reached the sea yet—and the harbor remains open when all other trade routes have failed. Here, the displaced gather, waiting for the world to make sense again.

## Geography

### Location
On the rocky Bitter Coast, Volkovka huddles around a natural harbor sheltered from the worst storms. Behind it, the blighted farmland stretches north toward Chernogrod and the Ashen Fields beyond.

### The Bitter Coast
A harsh shoreline of rocks and small coves. The fishing is good, but the weather is treacherous. Locals say the sea is the only thing in the Karath Reach that hasn't turned against them—yet.

## Demographics

### Population Surge
The town has more than doubled as refugees from abandoned villages seek shelter. The original families resent the newcomers; the newcomers are too desperate to care.

### Who Lives Here
- **The Old Families:** Fishing folk who've worked these waters for generations
- **The Displaced:** Farmers, villagers, and tradespeople whose homes the curse consumed
- **The Smugglers:** Those who profit from Chernogrod's isolation
- **The Changed:** Those who fled the Ashen Fields too late to be unchanged

## Economy

### Fishing
The primary—nearly only—legitimate industry. Fishing boats go out daily, bringing back whatever the sea provides. It's not enough to feed everyone, but it's something.

### Smuggling
Volkovka is the only accessible harbor on the Bitter Coast. Things that can't enter Chernogrod officially come through here. The authorities look the other way because the authorities get their cut.

### Salvage
Scavengers strip abandoned villages for anything of value. It's grim work, but someone profits.

## Notable Locations

### The Survivor's Hall
Once the village meeting house, now a combination refugee shelter, tavern, and emergency governance center. Elder Yuri holds court here.

### The Harbor
Perhaps twenty fishing boats and whatever other vessels happen to be in port. The docks are crowded with people hoping to leave.

### The Shrine of Lost Souls
Where the Mourning Women gather to sing for the villages that no longer exist. The list grows longer each month.

### The Smuggler's Cove
A hidden inlet where unofficial goods change hands. Everyone knows it exists; no one admits to knowing where.

## Key Figures

### Elder Yuri Volkov
The village headman, now managing a town five times the size his position was meant for. Exhausted, pragmatic, and doing his best with impossible circumstances.

### Captain Natasha Blackwater
Runs the largest fishing boat and the most successful smuggling operation. She'll transport anything, anywhere, for the right price—except toward the Ashen Fields.

### Father Dimitri
The local priest, stretched thin trying to provide comfort to the displaced. He's seen the Changed. He prays constantly.

## Current Situation

### The Curse Approaches
The blight is spreading. Fishing grounds that were safe last year now yield strange catches. Sailors report seeing lights on the shore where no one lives. It's only a matter of time.

### No Escape
Ships that might take refugees away don't come to the Bitter Coast. Those who can pay for passage to Porto Valdris do so; the rest remain, waiting.

## Secrets

1. **Something in the Deep.** The fishermen have noticed something moving in deep water—something large. The curse might be reaching the sea after all.

2. **Draven's Eyes.** Lord Draven has agents in Volkovka, watching who comes and goes, who knows too much, who might be useful.

3. **The Changed Among Us.** Some refugees are no longer entirely human. They hide it well. They're waiting for something.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Last Ship:** A merchant vessel could take refugees to safety—but the captain demands payment the town can't afford. Or does she want something else?

2. **The Deep Horror:** Fishermen are disappearing. What lurks in the deep? Is it connected to the curse?

3. **The Smuggler's Cargo:** Captain Blackwater's latest shipment contains something that shouldn't be moved. Opening it could be disastrous—or essential.

## Image Prompts

### Exterior
**Prompt:**
> Wide shot of Volkovka, a desperate fishing town on a rocky coast. Fishing boats crowd a natural harbor while ramshackle structures overflow with refugees. The original village of weathered stone is surrounded by tents and temporary shelters. Behind the town, gray blighted farmland stretches toward distant mountains. The sky is overcast, the sea dark gray. Smoke rises from cooking fires. The atmosphere is grim survival—a community at the edge of disaster.
