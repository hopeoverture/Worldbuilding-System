# Wolfsberg

## Overview
Wolfsberg clings to the highlands where the Eastern March rises toward the Ostmark Range. Named for the mountain wolves that once threatened the settlement—and now serve as its symbol—this hardy town breeds the toughest soldiers in the realm. The Thorne family maintains a minor branch here, and Lord Wulfric Thorne runs the town like a permanent military camp. When House Thorne marches to war, Wolfsberg's sons are always in the vanguard.

## Geography

### Location
Perched on a plateau overlooking the highland moors, Wolfsberg commands the approaches to the Ostmark Range from the south. The town is built around a central keep, with the settlement spreading down the mountainside in terraces.

### Climate
Harsh highland weather—cold winters, cool summers, constant wind. The locals say if you can survive a Wolfsberg winter, you can survive anything.

## Economy

### Primary Industries
- **Hunting:** The highlands teem with game; Wolfsberg hunters are legendary
- **Ranching:** Hardy mountain sheep and goats provide wool and meat
- **Military Training:** The Thorne War Academy prepares officers for the March armies

### Trade
Wolfsberg exports furs, wool, and trained soldiers. It imports grain, iron goods from Hammerhall, and anything the highlands don't produce.

## Notable Locations

### The Wolf Keep
Lord Wulfric's seat, a stern fortress dominating the town. Wolf skulls decorate its gates—trophies from the hunts that proved young warriors worthy.

### The War Academy
Where sons of lesser nobles and promising commoners learn the arts of war. Graduates become officers in the March armies.

### The Huntsman's Lodge
The largest tavern, decorated with trophies from legendary hunts. The fireplace never goes cold.

### Wolfmere
The bottomless mountain lake nearby, said to be home to something ancient. Locals give offerings before fishing.

## Key Figures

### Lord Wulfric Thorne
A minor cousin of Lady Margret, he rules Wolfsberg with iron discipline. Every citizen is a potential soldier; every day is training.

### Huntmaster Greta Stone-Eye
The realm's greatest tracker, missing one eye from a wolf attack in her youth. She trains the scouts who monitor the mountain passes.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Wolfmere Beast:** Something in the lake has awakened. Fishermen disappear. Offerings go missing. What lurks in the depths?

2. **The Academy Scandal:** A cadet has died under mysterious circumstances. His father demands answers—but the Academy has secrets it would kill to keep.
