# Wolfsberg

## Overview
Wolfsberg clings to the highlands where [[The Eastern March|the Eastern March]] rises toward the Ostmark Range. Named for the mountain wolves that once threatened the settlement—and now serve as its symbol—this hardy town breeds the toughest soldiers in the realm. The Thorne family maintains a minor branch here, and Lord Wulfric Thorne runs the town like a permanent military camp. When [[House Thorne]] marches to war, Wolfsberg's sons are always in the vanguard.

## Geography

### Location
Perched on a plateau overlooking the highland moors, Wolfsberg commands the approaches to the Ostmark Range from the south. The town is built around a central keep, with the settlement spreading down the mountainside in terraces.

### Climate
Harsh highland weather—cold winters, cool summers, constant wind. The locals say if you can survive a Wolfsberg winter, you can survive anything.

## Economy

### Primary Industries
- **Hunting:** The highlands teem with game; Wolfsberg hunters are legendary
- **Ranching:** Hardy mountain sheep and goats provide wool and meat
- **Military Training:** The Thorne War Academy prepares officers for [[The Eastern March|the March]] armies

### Trade
Wolfsberg exports furs, wool, and trained soldiers. It imports grain, iron goods from [[Hammerhall]], and anything the highlands don't produce.

## Notable Locations

### The Wolf Keep
Lord Wulfric's seat, a stern fortress dominating the town. Wolf skulls decorate its gates—trophies from the hunts that proved young warriors worthy.

### The War Academy
Where sons of lesser nobles and promising commoners learn the arts of war. Graduates become officers in [[The Eastern March|the March]] armies.

### The Huntsman's Lodge
The largest tavern, decorated with trophies from legendary hunts. The fireplace never goes cold.

### Wolfmere
The bottomless mountain lake nearby, said to be home to something ancient. Locals give offerings before fishing.

## Key Figures

### Lord Wulfric Thorne
A minor cousin of [[Lady Margret Thorne|Lady Margret]], he rules Wolfsberg with iron discipline. Every citizen is a potential soldier; every day is training.

### Huntmaster Greta Stone-Eye
The realm's greatest tracker, missing one eye from a wolf attack in her youth. She trains the scouts who monitor the mountain passes.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Wolfmere Beast:** Something in the lake has awakened. Fishermen disappear. Offerings go missing. What lurks in the depths?

2. **[[The Arcane Academy]] Scandal:** A cadet has died under mysterious circumstances. His father demands answers—but [[The Arcane Academy]] has secrets it would kill to keep.

### The Huntsman's Lodge
**Prompt:**
> Interior of the Huntsman's Lodge tavern in Wolfsberg on a winter evening. A massive stone fireplace dominates one wall, its fire roaring constantly against the highland cold. The walls are covered with hunting trophies—wolf pelts, boar tusks, a great stag's antlers, the skull of something monstrous from the mountains. Rough wooden tables filled with soldiers, hunters, and Academy cadets drinking ale and swapping stories. A grizzled huntmaster holds court in the corner, telling tales of legendary hunts. Weapons hung on pegs near the door—every patron armed. Snow visible through frost-covered windows. The smell of roasted meat and wood smoke. The atmosphere of warrior camaraderie and highland tradition—where reputations are made over firelight and ale.
