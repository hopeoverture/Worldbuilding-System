# Aasimar

> *"I was born with a halo of light around my head. My mother wept with joy; my father fell to his knees in prayer. The village priest declared me blessed by the Three. By the time I was twelve, I had been taken to [[Thornhall]] to serve the Faith. By twenty, I understood that being 'blessed' means carrying burdens that would crush ordinary souls. The Three did not give me this light to comfort me. They gave it so I could walk into the darkness where no one else can follow."*
> — Sister Caelynn of the Golden Dawn, [[The Grey Wardens|Grey Warden]] templar

## Overview

Aasimar are not born to aasimar parents—they are born to ordinary humans when the divine touches a mortal womb. In Eldermyr, they are seen as direct blessings from [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]], celestial souls placed in mortal form to serve as champions against darkness. Comprising less than 0.1% of the population (perhaps one birth in ten thousand), they are rare enough that most people will never meet one. Those who exist are typically raised by the Church, trained as holy warriors, healers, or priests. The current crisis has added a terrible complexity to aasimar existence: since [[The Unnamed]] began stirring, aasimar births have dropped dramatically. The Chronicler's covenant is broken; the connection to the divine seems compromised. Some aasimar have begun experiencing disturbing visions, their celestial heritage corrupted by the darkness seeping into the world.

## Species Traits

### Core Traits
- **Creature Type:** Humanoid and Celestial
- **Size:** Medium (human-size range)
- **Speed:** 30 feet
- **Lifespan:** ~160 years (longer than humans)

### Ability Score Increases
Per D&D 5e (2024) rules, ability scores are determined by Background rather than species.

### Languages
- **Automatic:** Common, Celestial
- **Additional Options:** Any languages of the Faith

### Racial Traits

#### Celestial Resistance
You have resistance to **Necrotic** and **Radiant** damage.

*Divine light flows through aasimar veins, protecting them from both holy and unholy energies.*

#### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

#### Healing Hands
As a Magic action, you touch a creature and roll d4s equal to your Proficiency Bonus. The creature regains that many hit points.

Once used, you can't use this trait again until you finish a Long Rest.

*The touch of an aasimar carries celestial healing—a gift meant to be shared with those who suffer.*

#### Light Bearer
You know the **Light** cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

*In darkness, aasimar can call forth the light of the divine.*

#### Celestial Revelation (3rd Level)
At 3rd level, choose one of the following transformations. You can use it once per Long Rest for 1 minute.

**Necrotic Shroud:** Dark wings sprout; creatures within 10 feet must make a CHA save (DC 8 + Proficiency + CHA modifier) or be Frightened. Once per turn, deal extra Necrotic damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

**Radiant Consumption:** Searing light radiates from you; creatures within 10 feet take Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus at end of your turns. Once per turn, deal extra Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

**Radiant Soul:** Spectral wings grant flying speed equal to walking speed. Once per turn, deal extra Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

*The celestial essence within an aasimar can manifest in different ways—as terrifying judgment, consuming purification, or transcendent grace.*

### Subraces/Lineages

Aasimar don't have subraces in the traditional sense, but their Celestial Revelation reflects which aspect of their divine heritage manifests most strongly:

- **Protector (Radiant Soul):** Associated with the Shepherd; healers and guardians
- **Scourge (Radiant Consumption):** Associated with the Warden; judges and warriors
- **Fallen (Necrotic Shroud):** Those whose light has been touched by shadow; feared even by the Church

### Stereotypes vs. Reality

**Stereotype:** Aasimar are perfect, sinless beings of pure light.
**Reality:** Aasimar are mortal souls with celestial gifts. They struggle with doubt, make mistakes, and sometimes fall.

**Stereotype:** Aasimar are always chosen by the gods for great purposes.
**Reality:** Some aasimar live ordinary lives, their celestial gifts used for small kindnesses rather than epic battles.

**Stereotype:** Aasimar cannot be evil.
**Reality:** Fallen aasimar exist—those whose light has been corrupted or extinguished. They are rare and terrible.

## Culture

### Society
Aasimar do not form their own society—they are rare individuals born into human communities. Most are raised by [[The Faith of the Three]], trained in [[Thornhall]], and deployed where the Church believes they are needed.

### The Church's Role
- **Identification:** The Church maintains networks to identify aasimar births
- **Training:** Young aasimar are brought to [[Thornhall]] for education and guidance
- **Assignment:** Trained aasimar are placed in roles—healers, templars, exorcists, missionaries
- **Control:** The Church expects obedience; renegade aasimar are pursued

### Religion & Spirituality
Aasimar are living proof of [[The Faith of the Three]]. Most are devout, though their relationship with the divine is more personal and complex than ordinary worshippers'. They may receive direct visions, hear celestial voices, and feel the gods' attention in ways that can be as burdensome as blessing.

**The Current Crisis:**
Since [[The Unnamed]] began stirring, many aasimar have reported disturbing changes:
- Visions have become darker, harder to interpret
- Healing touch sometimes fails or works unpredictably
- Some aasimar have experienced "falls"—their radiant gifts turning necrotic

The Church does not discuss this publicly. [[High Confessor Maren]] claims his own visions are divine truth—but are they?

### Art & Expression
Aasimar rarely develop distinct artistic traditions. Those raised by the Church express themselves through liturgical art, illumination, and devotional work.

### Naming Conventions
Aasimar receive human names at birth. Those raised by the Church often receive celestial epithets or take on saint-names.

**Example Names:**
- **Birth Names:** Any human names
- **Celestial Epithets:** "of the Golden Dawn," "the Merciful," "Lightbringer"
- **Saint-Names:** Taken from Church martyrs and heroes

## History

### Origins
The first aasimar appeared shortly after [[The Faith of the Three]] was established, seen as confirmation of the divine covenant. Throughout history, aasimar have appeared in times of need, often becoming saints, heroes, or martyrs.

### Role in Eldermyr
- **Champions:** Aasimar have served as holy warriors in every major conflict
- **Healers:** Many work as priests, tending to the suffering
- **Templars:** [[The Grey Wardens]] actively recruit aasimar for their fight against the undead
- **Symbols:** Their very existence reinforces faith; their suffering tests it

### The Current Crisis
Aasimar births have dropped sharply since [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]. Where once Eldermyr might see fifty aasimar births per generation, fewer than ten have occurred in the past two decades. The Chronicler's covenant is broken; souls do not rest properly; the connection between the divine and mortal realms is fraying.

What does this mean for existing aasimar? Are they the last of their kind? Or will the crisis, if resolved, restore the celestial touch?

## Homeland

Aasimar have no homeland—they are born wherever the divine chooses. However, [[Thornhall]] functions as their cultural center, where most are trained and where the Church maintains records of all known aasimar in the realm.

### Current Distribution
- **[[Thornhall]]:** ~40 aasimar in residence (training, recovery, or Church service)
- **[[The Grey Wardens]]:** ~15 aasimar serving in various capacities
- **Elsewhere:** Perhaps 50 more scattered throughout the realm
- **Total:** Roughly 100-120 living aasimar in Eldermyr

## Society Details

### The Church's System
- **Identification:** Midwives and priests are trained to recognize celestial births
- **Acquisition:** Families are strongly encouraged to surrender aasimar children to Church care
- **Training:** Years of religious education, martial training, and guidance in using celestial gifts
- **Assignment:** Graduated aasimar are placed where the Church believes they're needed
- **Monitoring:** The Church tracks all aasimar and expects reports

### Resistance
Some aasimar reject Church control:
- **Hidden Aasimar:** Those whose families concealed them; live as ordinary humans
- **Renegades:** Those who fled Church authority; hunted with varying intensity
- **The Fallen:** Those whose gifts have corrupted; the Church's greatest fear

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Common Folk:** Awe, reverence, and unease; meeting an aasimar is a religious experience
- **Nobles:** Political interest; aasimar presence confers legitimacy
- **The Church:** Pride and control; aasimar are proof of the Faith's truth
- **[[The Grey Wardens]]:** Valued allies; celestial resistance to undead is precious

### Perception of Others
Most aasimar view others through the lens of their calling:
- **Those They Protect:** The innocent, the suffering, the faithful
- **Those They Oppose:** The corrupt, the evil, servants of darkness
- **Those They Struggle With:** The Church hierarchy, which gives them purpose but also constrains them

### Integration
Aasimar don't truly integrate—they exist apart, marked by their nature. Some find this isolating; others embrace their difference as divine purpose.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Divine Mission:** Visions or Church orders send them into the world
- **Escape:** Fleeing Church control to find their own purpose
- **The Crisis:** The rising dead and broken covenant demand action
- **Seeking Answers:** Why have aasimar births stopped? What has happened to the divine connection?

### Common Classes
- **Paladin:** The archetypal aasimar warrior; oath-bound and radiant
- **Cleric:** Servants of [[The Faith of the Three]]; healers and guardians
- **Celestial Warlock:** Some aasimar formalize their divine connection as a pact
- **Fighter:** Templars trained in martial combat
- **Bard:** Some use their gifts for inspiration and hope

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Adventuring aasimar are seen as fulfilling divine purpose
- **Expectations:** Represent the Faith well; do not fall to darkness
- **Support:** The Church provides resources but expects reports and obedience

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- The weight of expectations—everyone assumes you're special
- Divine visions that may be disturbing, unclear, or conflicting
- The tension between Church control and personal choice
- Extraordinary empathy that can be overwhelming
- Fear of falling—what happens if your light goes out?

### Cultural Touchstones
- Church rituals and hierarchies
- The burden of being visibly different
- Relationships with the divine that are personal and complicated
- The current crisis affecting your very existence

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Aasimar can doubt, fear, and fail
- Not all aasimar are devout—some resent their nature
- Celestial heritage doesn't mean celestial personality
- The "Fallen" option exists for a reason

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **[[The Grey Wardens]] Templar:** Your celestial resistance makes you invaluable against the risen dead. But your visions have grown dark—are you seeing the enemy's plans, or being corrupted by them?

2. **Hidden Aasimar:** Your parents concealed your nature from the Church. You've lived as a commoner for twenty years. Now, with the crisis spreading, can you continue to hide—should you?

3. **Church Loyalist in Crisis:** You've served the Faith all your life. But [[High Confessor Maren]]'s visions don't match yours, and something about his certainty troubles you. Who speaks for the Three?

4. **Touched by Shadow:** Your Necrotic Shroud appeared after exposure to [[The Ashen Fields]]. The Church wants to "cure" you—or contain you. Are you falling, or evolving to fight a darker enemy?

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of an aasimar templar, female, early thirties—young by aasimar standards but carrying the weight of purpose in every line of her features. Strikingly beautiful in an otherworldly way, features too symmetrical, too perfect to be entirely human; skin of warm honey-gold with a subtle luminescence visible even in full light, as if lit from within. Large eyes of molten silver with no visible iris or pupil, seeming to reflect divine light that comes from nowhere visible—eyes that have seen visions no mortal should carry. Hair of white-gold that moves slightly as if touched by an unfelt breeze, worn long but pulled back in the practical style of a warrior, small braids at the temples bearing symbols of [[The Faith of the Three]]. Expression of profound compassion shadowed by sorrow, the look of someone who has seen too much suffering and feels called to witness more—determined yet grieved, holy yet deeply human. A faint suggestion of luminescence at the temples and cheekbones, the celestial nature barely contained by mortal form. Wearing a white surcoat over chain mail, the tabard bearing the intertwined symbols of the Three in silver thread; a gorget of blessed steel at the throat; at one shoulder, the gray badge of [[The Grey Wardens]]. Around her neck on a simple chain, a holy symbol that glows faintly in response to her nature. Background of a cathedral interior, light streaming through stained glass, suggesting [[Thornhall]] or [[Aldersgate]]. Dramatic lighting that emphasizes both the celestial radiance and the mortal flesh—warm gold light from an unseen window mixing with the subtle glow of the aasimar herself.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
The Hall of the Touched in [[Thornhall]]—a sacred space where aasimar train, meditate, and receive visions, one of the few places where they can be among their own kind. A circular chamber of white marble and silver filigree, the domed ceiling painted with scenes of celestial beings descending to mortal realms. Seven aasimar of various ages gathered for evening devotions—each visibly marked by their divine heritage in different ways: one with solid gold eyes, another with faintly luminescent skin patterns, a third with hair that shimmers with inner light, a fourth with small feathered wings folded at their back. They range from a newly-arrived adolescent barely understanding their nature to an ancient woman whose white-on-white form seems almost translucent with accumulated divinity. Each dressed in the simple white robes of devotion, though personal holy symbols and marks of rank distinguish them. They kneel or sit in a loose circle around a central pool of holy water that reflects light from sources unseen. The eldest leads them in prayer, her voice resonating strangely, and the others respond—the sound of their combined voices creating harmonics that no human choir could achieve. Around the edges of the hall, Church officials observe through doorways—their presence a reminder that even here, the aasimar are watched. The atmosphere is one of sacred community and subtle tragedy—these few are all that remains of the divine touch in a generation, and they know it. Light comes from the aasimar themselves as much as from the high windows, each one a small sun contributing to the illumination, their combined presence making the chamber bright as noon despite the evening hour.

## Notes

The decline in aasimar births is one of the most troubling signs that the divine covenant is broken. The Church has not announced this publicly—it would cause panic—but senior clergy know. [[High Confessor Maren]] claims his visions explain everything, but some question whether his certainty comes from the Three or something else.

Aasimar fighting at [[The Ashen Fields]] have reported that their celestial gifts work differently there. Healing Hands sometimes fails. Radiant damage seems less effective. Some have developed Necrotic Shrouds who previously manifested Radiant forms. Is [[The Unnamed]] specifically corrupting celestial energy? Or is the pollution of death itself affecting the divine connection?

If the covenant could be restored—if [[The Blackened Crown]] could be destroyed and souls allowed to rest—would aasimar births resume? This question haunts the few remaining aasimar, who wonder if they are witnessing the end of their kind.
