# Dragonborn

> *"Yes, we breathe fire—or lightning, or frost, depending on the bloodline. Yes, our ancestors made a pact with dragons in the days before your kingdoms existed. No, we cannot fly, we do not hoard gold, and we are not interested in eating your livestock. We are merchants, scholars, and sailors. We have been trading across [[The Trader's Sea]] for longer than [[House Valdren]] has existed. Now, shall we discuss the silk shipment, or do you have more inane questions about whether I eat maidens?"*
> — Commodore Kriv Flamescale, addressing a new [[Porto Valdris]] port official

## Overview

Dragonborn are a rare and exotic people who trace their ancestry to ancient pacts between humans and dragons in the Age of Clans. Comprising perhaps 2% of Eldermyr's population, they are concentrated primarily in [[The Western Shore]], particularly around [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]] and the ports of [[Porto Valdris]]. The dragonborn are renowned merchants, sailors, and scholars—their draconic heritage granting them natural authority and their long trading tradition making them valuable partners. Unlike other rare species who face discrimination, dragonborn often command respect (tinged with wariness). They stay carefully neutral in human political conflicts, maintaining trading relationships with all parties. The succession crisis threatens their carefully cultivated position—and the rising dead threaten something far more fundamental.

## Species Traits

### Core Traits
- **Creature Type:** Humanoid
- **Size:** Medium (6-7 feet tall)
- **Speed:** 30 feet
- **Lifespan:** ~80 years; similar to humans

### Ability Score Increases
Per D&D 5e (2024) rules, ability scores are determined by Background rather than species.

### Languages
- **Automatic:** Common, Draconic
- **Additional Options:** Any trading languages relevant to their routes

### Racial Traits

#### Draconic Ancestry
Choose one dragon type. This determines your breath weapon shape, damage type, and resistance.

| Ancestry | Damage | Breath Shape |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Black | Acid | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Blue | Lightning | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Brass | Fire | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Bronze | Lightning | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Copper | Acid | 30 ft. line, 5 ft. wide |
| Gold | Fire | 15 ft. cone |
| Green | Poison | 15 ft. cone |
| Red | Fire | 15 ft. cone |
| Silver | Cold | 15 ft. cone |
| White | Cold | 15 ft. cone |

#### Breath Weapon
When you take the Attack action, you can replace one attack with your breath weapon:
- Area per ancestry (30 ft. line or 15 ft. cone)
- Damage: 1d10 (2d10 at 5th, 3d10 at 11th, 4d10 at 17th level)
- DC = 8 + CON modifier + Proficiency Bonus
- Uses equal your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest

*The draconic heritage manifests most dramatically in the breath weapon—living fire, lightning, or other elemental force summoned from within.*

#### Damage Resistance
You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry.

*Dragon blood grants protection against the elements that flow through your veins.*

#### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

*Draconic eyes pierce the darkness that would blind lesser folk.*

### Subraces/Lineages

While not mechanical subraces, dragonborn identify strongly with their ancestral dragon type:

**Metallic Bloodlines (Gold, Silver, Bronze, Brass, Copper):** Traditionally associated with wisdom, honor, and trade. More common in Eldermyr.

**Chromatic Bloodlines (Red, Blue, Green, Black, White):** Traditionally associated with passion, ambition, and power. Rarer; face more suspicion.

## Physical Characteristics

- **Eye Characteristics:** Slit-pupiled like a reptile; often metallic or jewel-toned colors
- **Distinctive Features:** Scaled skin, draconic head, clawed hands, vestigial tail (some)
- **Sexual Dimorphism:** Minimal; males may have larger crests; females may have more elaborate scale patterns

### Aging

- **Balance (Thrae):** The draconic pact demands respect between species

### Stereotypes vs. Reality

**Stereotype:** Dragonborn hoard gold and treasure.
**Reality:** Dragonborn hoard—but the object varies. Scholars hoard knowledge. Merchants hoard relationships. Warriors hoard victories. The instinct expresses itself in many ways.

**Stereotype:** Dragonborn are arrogant and think themselves superior.
**Reality:** Dragonborn are proud—their heritage demands no less. But pride in excellence isn't the same as contempt for others.

**Stereotype:** Dragonborn are barely-controlled monsters.
**Reality:** Dragonborn have lived in civilized society for millennia. They have better self-control than most humans.

## Culture

### Society
- **Government Forms:** Merchant councils; clan leadership; meritocratic traditions
- **Social Hierarchy:** Achievement-based; clan membership matters but individual accomplishment matters more
- **Family Structures:** Extended clan networks; eggs often raised collectively
- **Gender Roles:** Minimal differentiation; traditional roles exist but aren't enforced

### Values & Philosophy
- **The Pact:** The ancient agreement between dragonborn ancestors and dragons established mutual respect and obligation. Dragonborn honor this by being worthy of their heritage.
- **Trade as Art:** Commerce is a sophisticated discipline requiring intelligence, patience, and integrity.
- **Neutrality as Survival:** Taking sides in human conflicts is dangerous. Maintain trade with everyone.
- **Excellence in All Things:** Mediocrity shames the dragon blood.

### Religion & Spirituality
**Bahamut (The Platinum Dragon):** Metallic dragonborn honor Bahamut, god of justice and honorable combat. His temples exist in [[Porto Valdris]].

**Tiamat (The Dragon Queen):** Chromatic dragonborn may honor Tiamat privately; public worship is discouraged as it frightens humans.

**[[The Faith of the Three]]:** Some dragonborn have adopted the human faith, finding parallels between Bahamut and the Warden.

**Ancestor Dragons:** The specific dragon who formed the pact with a dragonborn's ancestors may be venerated as a family patron.

### Art & Expression
- **Visual Arts:** Scale mosaics, metalwork, gem-setting; beauty through precision
- **Music:** Deep-voiced choral traditions; horn instruments
- **Literature:** Extensive written histories; contract poetry; legal literature as art form
- **Performance:** Formal debate, ritual combat, breath weapon displays

### Naming Conventions

## History

### Origins
In the Age of Clans, before humans had unified kingdoms, certain desperate tribes sought power to survive. They approached dragons—beings of immense power who largely ignored the affairs of lesser creatures. Through unknown means, some humans convinced certain dragons to share their blood, their breath, and their legacy. The dragonborn are the result—neither human nor dragon, but something new.

The truth of the Pact is now lost to history. Did the dragons grant this gift freely? Were they compelled? What did they receive in return? Dragonborn scholars have spent centuries trying to reconstruct the original agreement.

### Historical Eras

**The Pact Age (Mythic):**
The first dragonborn emerged, changed forever. They gathered together, establishing communities separate from their human ancestors.

**The Trading Age (Centuries):**
Dragonborn found their niche as traders, sailors, and neutral parties in human conflicts. [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]] became their primary settlement—a strait they've controlled for generations.

**The Present Day:**
Dragonborn maintain their traditional roles as merchants and traders. The succession crisis threatens their neutrality—every faction wants their support, and refusing all may prove impossible.

### Relationship with Other Species
- **Humans:** Trading partners and occasional employers; relations generally good
- **Dwarves:** Mutual respect for craft and trade; some competition
- **Elves:** Distant; elves remember when dragons were enemies
- **Halflings:** Pleasant trading partners; no significant conflicts
- **Gnomes:** Curiosity and trade; gnomes fascinated by dragonborn biology

### Diaspora
Dragonborn originated around [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]] and have spread primarily along trade routes. Most remain in [[The Western Shore]], with small communities in major trading ports.

## Homeland

### Traditional Lands
[[Lo Stretto d'Oro]]—the Golden Strait—has been dragonborn territory since before [[House Valdren]] rose to prominence. They don't rule it politically (it falls under Valdren jurisdiction) but they dominate its commerce and maintain ancestral estates on both shores.

**The Dragon Quarter of [[Porto Valdris]]:** A wealthy neighborhood where dragonborn families maintain townhouses and trading offices.

### Current Distribution
- **Lo Stretto d'Oro:** ~1,500 dragonborn (primary population)
- **Porto Valdris:** ~800 (trading families)
- **Other Western Shore:** ~500 (scattered)
- **Elsewhere in Eldermyr:** ~200 (individuals, mostly merchants)

## Society Details

### Government
- **Leadership Selection:** Clan elders form councils; the Commodore of the Strait is elected by merchant families
- **Decision-making:** Consensus among major families; individual clans autonomous
- **Laws and Justice:** Dragonborn law governs dragonborn; complex treaties with human authorities

### Economy
- **Common Occupations:** Merchant, sailor, scholar, factor, diplomat, guard
- **Trade Goods:** Silk, spices, exotic goods, shipping services, financial services
- **Economic Philosophy:** Fair dealing builds lasting relationships; short-term cheating destroys long-term wealth

### Military
- **Warrior Culture:** All dragonborn can fight; professional warriors serve as ship guards and estate protection
- **Preferred Weapons:** Longsword, javelin, breath weapon; naval combat expertise
- **Military Organization:** Clan militias; ship crews double as marines

### Education
- **Knowledge Transmission:** Formal schools; apprenticeships in trading houses
- **Formal Education:** The Academy of the Strait teaches commerce, languages, and history
- **Valued Knowledge:** Trade law, languages, navigation, negotiation, clan history

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Humans:** "Impressive and slightly terrifying; deal fairly with them and they deal fairly with you"
- **Dwarves:** "Fire-breathers who understand the value of good work; better as partners than competitors"
- **Elves:** "Dragon-touched humans; an experiment that worked out better than expected"
- **Halflings:** "Very tall, very scary, but they pay fairly and their ships are comfortable"

### Perception of Others
- **Humans:** Useful trading partners; politically unstable; individually variable
- **Dwarves:** Excellent craftsmen; reliable partners; share appreciation for lasting quality
- **Elves:** Ancient and complicated; potential customers for luxury goods
- **Halflings:** Good factors in agricultural regions; reliable in small things
- **Tieflings:** Fellow outsiders; sympathy for their situation; occasional kinship

### Integration
Dragonborn integrate on their own terms. They live in dragonborn neighborhoods, maintain dragonborn customs, but participate fully in economic life. They are too useful to exclude and too proud to assimilate completely.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Trade Mission:** Establishing new routes or retrieving exotic goods
- **Clan Honor:** Proving worth or redeeming family reputation
- **Curiosity:** Dragons were once everywhere; their ruins call to dragon-blood
- **Crisis Response:** The rising dead threaten trade routes and violate the natural order
- **Personal Quest:** Seeking the truth about the original Pact

### Common Classes
- **Paladin:** Dragonborn honor and combat prowess combine naturally
- **Fighter:** Trading families produce capable warriors
- **Sorcerer:** Dragon blood sometimes manifests as arcane power
- **Warlock:** Some seek to understand their heritage through pacts
- **Bard:** Dragonborn diplomatic traditions produce excellent persuaders

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Adventurers who succeed bring honor and wealth to their clans
- **Cultural Expectations:** Represent your clan well; maintain dragonborn reputation
- **Support from Community:** Trading houses may sponsor expeditions

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Pride in your heritage without arrogance toward others
- Long-term thinking; consider consequences before acting
- Awareness of being visually distinctive; you don't blend in
- Draconic impulses (hoarding, territoriality) expressed in civilized ways
- Breath weapon as a last resort, not a first option

### Cultural Touchstones
- Trading courtesy and negotiation protocols
- Awareness of clan reputation
- Respect for contracts and given word
- Interest in draconic history and artifacts

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Not all dragonborn are merchants—warriors, scholars, artists exist
- Draconic heritage is part of identity, not the whole identity
- Dragonborn have senses of humor, fears, and flaws
- Individual beliefs may differ from clan traditions

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **Young Trader:** Sent to establish trade routes beyond traditional Western Shore territory. The succession crisis is an opportunity—or a deadly trap.

2. **Pact Seeker:** You've found hints that the original dragonborn-dragon pact included clauses about the end of the world. [[The Unnamed]]'s awakening may be relevant.

3. **Chromatic Outcast:** Your red dragon heritage makes humans nervous. Tired of prejudice, you've taken to adventuring where your breath weapon is an asset rather than a liability.

4. **[[House Valdren]] Loyalist:** Your family has served Valdren interests for generations. But with the succession crisis, where do your loyalties lie—with the house, or with dragonborn neutrality?

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a dragonborn merchant prince, male, approximately fifty years old—well into his prime, carrying the confident bearing of someone who has mastered the art of trade. Draconic features pronounced: an elongated head with a pronounced snout, powerful jaw, and elegant bronze scales that catch the light like hammered metal. The scales vary in tone—deeper bronze in the hollows, bright gold on the ridges, with the weathered patina of sea-wind and age. Eyes of molten amber with vertical slit pupils, holding the calculating assessment of someone who has closed a thousand deals and sees through every bluff. A modest crest of darker bronze scales sweeping back from the brow, the dragonborn equivalent of distinguished gray temples. Prominent nostrils that flare slightly—the architecture that houses a breath weapon of lightning. Expression of patient confidence and veiled amusement, the look of someone who knows something you don't and is deciding whether to share. Wearing the layered silks and fine linens of a [[Porto Valdris]] merchant prince—deep blue outer robe embroidered with silver thread in wave patterns, a golden collar bearing the Flamescale clan insignia, an inner shirt of cream silk visible at the neck. A single earring of electrum in one pointed ear, marking rank in the trader's hierarchy. Background suggesting a wealthy office: blurred shapes of maps, fine furniture, a glimpse of sea through a window. Warm golden light of late afternoon through expensive glass, catching the metallic scales and silk, emphasizing wealth earned through generations of excellence.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
The Grand Trading Hall of [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]]—where dragonborn clans have conducted business for longer than human kingdoms have existed. A magnificent hall of white stone and bronze fixtures, the architecture blending human and draconic aesthetics—soaring arches supported by columns shaped like coiled dragons, windows of colored glass casting jewel-toned light across the marble floor. Six dragonborn merchants in formal attire engaged in negotiation around a central table spread with trade goods: bolts of silk, spice samples in bronze containers, maps weighted with gold coins, contracts in multiple languages. The merchants represent different bloodlines—scales of bronze, silver, gold, and deep copper—but all wearing the elaborate formal robes of their profession, each outfit subtly displaying clan wealth and status. At the head of the table, an ancient dragonborn matriarch with faded silver scales presides, her word clearly law in this space. Around the edges of the hall, human and dwarf factors wait patiently for their turn, respectful but clearly secondary to the main proceedings. Through tall windows, the azure waters of the strait visible, ships at anchor flying the flags of a dozen ports. On the walls, the accumulated treasures of centuries—tapestries depicting the original Pact, portraits of legendary merchants, racks of scrolls containing trade agreements from generations past. The atmosphere of wealth, tradition, and the sophisticated dance of commerce where fortunes are made and empires rise or fall. Light streaming through colored windows creating dramatic rays across the scene, catching scales and silk, turning the dust motes into floating gold.

## Notes

Dragonborn neutrality in the succession crisis is increasingly difficult to maintain. [[House Valdren]] considers the [[Lo Stretto d'Oro]] dragonborn their subjects and expects support. Other factions are willing to make offers. If the dragonborn pick a side, their trading privileges with other factions will suffer. If they pick no side, all factions may turn against them.

More concerning to dragonborn scholars: the rising dead violate the natural order in ways that may threaten the original Pact. Dragons were involved in the binding of [[The Unnamed]] (or so ancient texts suggest). If the binding fails completely, what happens to those who carry dragon blood?

Some dragonborn have begun quietly researching the connection between their ancestry and the crisis. What did the dragons know about the darkness below? And what obligations does the Pact place on dragonborn in times of such catastrophe?
