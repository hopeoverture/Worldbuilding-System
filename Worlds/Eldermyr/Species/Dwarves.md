# Dwarves

> *"The stone remembers what flesh forgets. We were here before the first human king drew breath, and we will be here when the last human kingdom falls to dust. We do not seek to rule your world—we seek only to craft, to endure, and to honor the debts we owe. But understand this: a dwarf's memory is longer than a human's life, and we remember every slight, every kindness, every oath sworn and broken."*
> — Forgemaster [[Grimhild the Smith]], addressing the Council of [[Aldersgate]]

## Overview

The dwarves of Eldermyr are an ancient and proud people whose mountain halls predate human civilization by millennia. Though they number perhaps 10% of the realm's population, their influence far exceeds their count—dwarven steel arms the armies of every great house, dwarven engineering built the great bridges and fortifications, and dwarven craft produces the finest goods in the realm. They are concentrated primarily in [[The Eastern March]], where their ancient alliance with [[House Thorne]] has endured for eight centuries. The dwarves maintain careful neutrality in human political disputes, but they remember that [[The Mad King]]'s armies tried to breach their mountain gates, and they remember who stood with them.

## Species Traits

### Core Traits
- **Creature Type:** Humanoid
- **Size:** Medium (4-5 feet tall)
- **Speed:** 30 feet (dwarves are deceptively quick despite their build)
- **Lifespan:** ~350 years average; 400+ years for exceptional individuals

### Ability Score Increases
Per D&D 5e (2024) rules, ability scores are determined by Background rather than species.

### Languages
- **Automatic:** Common, Dwarvish
- **Additional Options:** Giant (for those who trade with mountain peoples), Undercommon (for those who deal with deep dwellers)

### Racial Traits

#### Darkvision (120 ft.)
Dwarven eyes are adapted to the lightless depths of mountain halls. You can see in dim light within 120 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

*In Eldermyr, dwarves spend generations in underground holds where torchlight is precious. Their eyes have adapted to see by heat, by reflected crystal-light, by means humans cannot comprehend.*

#### Dwarven Resilience
You have resistance to **Poison** damage and **Advantage** on saving throws to avoid or end the **Poisoned** condition.

*Dwarves work with toxic metals, volcanic gases, and potent brews. Those who could not tolerate such exposure died long ago. The survivors' descendants are remarkably hardy.*

#### Dwarven Toughness
Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.

*Stone does not yield easily to blade or bludgeon. Neither do dwarves.*

#### Stonecunning
As a **Bonus Action**, you gain Tremorsense with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes. You must be on a stone surface or touching a stone surface to use this ability. Once used, you cannot use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest (or expend a spell slot).

*Through their feet, dwarves feel the heartbeat of the mountain. They know when tunnels are unstable, when enemies approach, when the deep places stir.*

### Subraces/Lineages

While the 2024 rules do not include mechanical dwarven subraces, Eldermyr recognizes cultural distinctions:

#### Mountain Dwarves (Khazad-dûm)
The majority, dwelling in the great halls of [[The Ostmark Range]]. Traditional, proud, focused on craft and clan.

#### Hill Dwarves (Khazad-bâr)
Those who have settled in human lands, particularly around [[Hammerhall]] and [[Grimhold]]. More integrated with human society, but still distinctly dwarven.

#### Deep Dwarves (Khazad-nâr)
Rumors speak of dwarves who delved too deep in [[The Deep Delving]] and found something that changed them. These are rarely seen on the surface.

## Physical Characteristics

### Appearance
- **Height and Build:** 4-5 feet tall; broad and heavily muscled; dense bone structure makes them heavier than they appear
- **Skin Coloring:** Ranges from pale (deep dwellers) to ruddy bronze (surface workers); often weathered and scarred from forge-work
- **Hair:** Brown, black, red, or gray; males grow elaborate beards from early adulthood; females may have fine sideburns or choose to remain clean-faced
- **Eye Characteristics:** Deep-set, adapted to darkness; colors include amber, brown, gray, and rarely stone-blue; eyes seem to catch light in the dark
- **Distinctive Features:** Broad noses, prominent brows, thick fingers adapted for precision work; ears slightly pointed but less than elves
- **Sexual Dimorphism:** Males and females similar in build; males grow fuller beards; outsiders sometimes cannot distinguish genders

### Aging
- **Childhood and Maturation:** Dwarven children mature slowly; not considered adult until 50 years
- **Adult Prime:** 50-200 years; most productive craft and family period
- **Elder Characteristics:** Beards turn gray, then white; skin becomes like weathered stone; mind remains sharp
- **Signs of Aging:** Hair graying, slight loss of height, joints may stiffen; mental faculties remain until near death

### Variations
- **Forge-Workers:** Often bear burn scars, have callused hands, and smell of metal and smoke
- **Miners:** Pale skin, broader builds, often missing fingers or bearing old wound marks
- **Surface Dwarves:** Tanned, may wear hair shorter, dress in human styles but always with dwarven quality

## Biology

### Physiology
- **Dietary Needs:** Omnivorous; prefer meat, mushrooms, and root vegetables; can survive on minimal food for extended periods
- **Sleep Patterns:** Require only 4-6 hours; can go without sleep longer than humans without ill effect
- **Environmental Tolerances:** Highly resistant to cold; tolerate heat well (forge adaptation); uncomfortable in humid climates
- **Reproduction:** Live birth after 12-month gestation; rarely more than one child; fertility lower than humans
- **Unique Senses:** Tremorsense when using Stonecunning; can sense temperature changes through stone

### Life Cycle
- **Birth:** Live birth; dwarven infants are sturdy but rare; birth celebrated by entire clan
- **Childhood Duration:** 50 years to maturity (first century still considered "young")
- **Maturity Age:** 50 years
- **Adult Lifespan:** 300-350 years typical
- **Maximum Age:** ~400 years; 450+ nearly legendary

### Health & Medicine
- **Common Ailments:** Lung conditions from mining dust (though resistant), joint issues in extreme age
- **Resistances:** Poison, disease (to a degree), extreme temperatures
- **Healing Differences:** Heal slightly slower than humans but more completely; scars are badges of honor
- **Dietary Requirements:** High protein, minerals; deficiency causes weakness over decades

## Psychology

### Mental Characteristics
- **Cognitive Tendencies:** Long-term planners; excellent memory; resistant to mental manipulation; methodical
- **Emotional Expression:** Reserved with outsiders; passionate among kin; slow to trust, impossible to shake once given
- **Common Personality Patterns:** Stubborn, loyal, proud, honest to a fault, grudge-holding
- **Learning Styles:** Apprenticeship and tradition; innovation happens slowly but permanently

### Instincts
- **Clan loyalty:** Dwarves instinctively protect their own before outsiders
- **Craft drive:** Most dwarves feel incomplete without creating something
- **Territorial:** Strong attachment to specific places, especially ancestral holds

### Values
- **Honor (Uzbad):** One's word is binding; breaking an oath is the worst sin
- **Craft (Khuzd):** Creating lasting works honors ancestors and provides for descendants
- **Clan (Sigin):** Family and clan come before self or outsiders
- **Memory (Mazarb):** Remember the ancestors; remember debts owed and owing

### Stereotypes vs. Reality

**Stereotype:** Dwarves are greedy gold-hoarders.
**Reality:** Dwarves value wealth as a measure of craft and legacy, not for its own sake. A dwarf who hoards gold without purpose is considered ill.

**Stereotype:** Dwarves hate elves.
**Reality:** Ancient conflicts exist, but modern dwarves and elves have little contact. Distrust stems from different worldviews, not active hatred.

**Stereotype:** All dwarves are smiths or miners.
**Reality:** Dwarven society includes scholars, merchants, brewers, farmers (of underground crops), warriors, priests, and more.

## Culture

### Society
- **Government Forms:** Clan councils ruled by elders; High King of the Mountain (Uzbad Khazad-dûm) is largely ceremonial
- **Social Hierarchy:** Clan-based; status determined by craft skill, age, and ancestral deeds
- **Family Structures:** Extended clan networks; nuclear family lives within clan holds; children raised by entire clan
- **Gender Roles:** Largely egalitarian; both genders craft, fight, and govern; beard customs are the main visible difference

### Values & Philosophy
- **The Long View:** Dwarves plan in centuries, not years; this can seem slow to humans
- **Craft as Worship:** Creating lasting works honors the Stone Father who shaped them
- **Debts and Grudges:** Both are sacred; kindness is repaid with interest, wrongs are recorded in the Book of Grudges
- **Endurance:** The mountain endures; so must the dwarf

### Religion & Spirituality

**The Stone Father (Mahal):** Creator deity who shaped the first dwarves from living rock. Not part of [[The Faith of the Three]]; dwarves tolerate the human religion but do not follow it.

**Ancestor Veneration:** Dead dwarves are entombed in clan crypts; their spirits are believed to watch over descendants. Disturbing dwarf graves is unforgivable.

**The Deep Dark:** Something stirs in the deepest places. Dwarves do not speak of it to outsiders. It is not [[The Unnamed]]—or perhaps it is another face of the same horror.

### Art & Expression
- **Visual Arts:** Stone carving, metalwork, geometric patterns; representational art is rare
- **Music:** Drums and deep horns; chanting; mining songs that echo through tunnels
- **Literature:** Oral histories, clan sagas, runic inscriptions; little fiction as humans understand it
- **Performance:** Ritual performances at clan gatherings; rarely shared with outsiders

### Naming Conventions

#### Language & Phonetics
- **Language Name:** Khuzdul (Dwarvish)
- **Real-World Inspiration:** Tolkien's Khuzdul (Semitic-influenced)
- **Phonetic Rules:** Hard consonants (kh, g, z, d); guttural sounds; few pure vowels

#### Name Structure
- **First/Birth Names:** Given at birth by parents
- **Family/Clan Names:** Clan name used formally; "-son"/"-daughter" patronymics
- **Earned Names/Epithets:** Granted for great deeds or craft achievements
- **Secret/True Names:** Clan names are semi-secret; outsiders use simplified versions

## History

### Origins
Dwarven legend holds that the Stone Father (Mahal) carved the first Seven Fathers from living rock beneath the mountains when the world was young. The dwarves remember times before humans existed—they were already ancient when the first human tribes wandered into what would become Eldermyr.

### Historical Eras

**The Shaping (Mythic):**
The Seven Fathers awoke in darkness and began the Great Work—carving the mountain halls, learning the secrets of metal, establishing the clans.

**The Age of Isolation (Ancient):**
For millennia, dwarves had little contact with surface dwellers. Humans were primitive; elves were rivals who sometimes clashed over territory.

**The Opening (800 years ago):**
When humans unified under the first kings, dwarves began trading with them. The alliance with [[House Thorne]] dates to this period—[[The Ostmark Range]] dwarves aided the March lords in securing the eastern border.

**The Great War (27-23 years ago):**
[[The Mad King]] demanded the dwarves open their gates and provide soldiers. They refused. Valdus's armies attempted to breach the mountain holds and failed. When the rebellion began, dwarves provided arms to the rebels—not soldiers, but steel that won battles.

### Relationship with Other Species
- **Humans:** Trade partners and allies (especially [[House Thorne]]); viewed as short-lived but capable
- **Elves:** Ancient tension, little modern contact; mutual wariness; different approaches to craft and time
- **Gnomes:** Respected cousins; rock gnomes especially welcome in dwarven holds
- **Halflings:** Friendly; dwarves appreciate halfling brewing and farming
- **Orcs:** Enemies of old; some modern tolerance but long memories
- **Goliaths:** Neighbors in the high mountains; mutual respect between the giant-blooded and the stone-born

### Diaspora
Dwarves have spread little. The mountain holds remain their center, with [[Hammerhall]] as the primary surface-level dwarven settlement. Individual dwarves may travel widely, but the clan-holds are always home.

## Homeland

### Traditional Lands
The dwarven realm lies beneath [[The Ostmark Range]] and [[The Greycrowns]], a vast underground network of halls, mines, and passages. The surface sees only the gates—the true cities lie miles below.

**Khazad-dûm (The Great Hall):** The primary dwarven city beneath [[Ostmark Pass]]; population perhaps 30,000; never fallen to enemies
**[[The Deep Delving]]:** The deepest mines; abandoned after something was awakened; sealed but not forgotten

### Current Distribution
- **Majority Populations:** Mountain holds, [[Hammerhall]], [[Grimhold]]
- **Minority Communities:** [[Stahlburg]], [[Aldersgate]] (craftsmen quarters), [[Porto Valdris]] (gemcutters)
- **Urban vs. Rural:** Dwarves are urban by nature; their "rural" is mining outposts

## Society Details

### Government
- **Leadership Selection:** Clan elders choose representatives; High King of the Mountain selected by council of clan heads
- **Decision-making:** Consensus preferred; matters affecting all clans require unanimous agreement
- **Laws and Justice:** Ancient codes; punishment by exile is worse than death; the Book of Grudges records offenses

### Economy
- **Common Occupations:** Smith, miner, engineer, mason, brewer, jeweler, merchant
- **Trade Goods:** Weapons, armor, tools, jewelry, stonework, ale, rare metals
- **Economic Philosophy:** Fair value for fair work; no charity but debts are honored; wealth measured in craft reputation

### Military
- **Warrior Culture:** Every dwarf can fight; professional soldiers called Ironguard
- **Preferred Weapons:** War hammer, axe, crossbow; shield walls in tight spaces
- **Military Organization:** Clan militias answer to their elders; all answer to the High King in emergencies

### Education
- **Knowledge Transmission:** Master-apprentice relationships lasting decades; written records in runic archives
- **Formal Education:** Young dwarves learn clan history, basic craft, and combat; specialization comes with age
- **Valued Knowledge:** Craft secrets, mining techniques, ancient histories, enemy weaknesses

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Humans:** "Reliable but stubborn; their steel is worth the price; don't cross them"
- **Elves:** "The loud children of the dark places; skilled but lacking subtlety"
- **Halflings:** "Good folk, if a bit grim; throw the best parties when they finally relax"
- **Orcs:** "Dangerous little badgers who live in stone; respect their craft, fear their vengeance"

### Perception of Others
- **Humans:** Short-lived and hasty; capable of greatness but prone to foolishness; some worth knowing
- **Elves:** Arrogant, slow to act, too pretty for their own good; their ancient craft has merit
- **Halflings:** Pleasant neighbors; good cooks; wise enough to avoid trouble
- **Orcs:** Brutal and untrustworthy; keep them at arm's length; never forget the old wars
- **Gnomes:** Kin of a sort; clever with mechanisms; welcome in the holds
- **Goliaths:** Respect their strength and endurance; good trading partners

### Integration
Dwarves who live among humans maintain their identity fiercely. Dwarven quarters in human cities are self-governing enclaves. Intermarriage with other species is extremely rare and often results in social exile.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Clan Missions:** Sent to retrieve artifacts, establish trade, or investigate threats
- **Exile:** Those who broke oaths may seek redemption through deeds
- **Craft Quest:** Seeking rare materials or lost techniques
- **Debt Payment:** Repaying kindness shown to the clan
- **Grudge Pursuit:** The Book of Grudges sometimes requires personal action

### Common Classes
- **Fighter:** Traditional dwarven warrior, master of hammer and shield
- **Cleric:** Priest of the Stone Father or ancestor-speaker
- **Artificer:** The epitome of dwarven craft-magic
- **Barbarian:** Rare but terrifying; berserkers who channel ancient rage
- **Paladin:** Oathsworn protectors of clan and hold

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Dwarves who adventure are respected if they return with wealth, knowledge, or honor
- **Cultural Expectations:** Bring credit to the clan; never shame the ancestors; keep your oaths
- **Support from Community:** The clan provides equipment and expects repayment in deeds or gold

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Think in longer timescales; what seems urgent to humans may not be to you
- Oaths and promises are binding; never give your word lightly
- Craft and creation bring satisfaction; idleness is uncomfortable
- Clan loyalty trumps personal preference
- Grudges are not petty—they're sacred obligations

### Cultural Touchstones
- Beard maintenance and style (if applicable) reflects status
- Appreciation for quality craftsmanship in any form
- Distaste for shoddy work, broken promises, or dishonored debts
- Preference for stone and metal over wood and cloth
- Respect for ancestors; interest in lineages and histories

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Not all dwarves are gruff—some are jovial, especially among trusted friends
- Dwarven women are as prominent as men; outsiders just can't always tell them apart
- Craft means more than smithing; dwarven poets, healers, and scholars exist
- Modern dwarves may have complex views on ancient grudges—not everyone agrees with tradition

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **[[The Forgemasters Guild]] Journeyman:** Sent to surface lands to gather rare materials for [[Grimhild the Smith]]'s secret commission. Knows something terrible is being forged but not why.

2. **Exiled Oathbreaker:** Broke a clan oath to save human friends during [[The Great War]]. Now seeks enough glory to redeem their name—or enough distance to forget their shame.

3. **Deep Delving Survivor:** Was part of the expedition that awakened something in [[The Deep Delving]]. The only survivor. Cannot speak of what happened. Plagued by stone-dreams and tremor-visions.

4. **[[House Thorne]] Armorer:** A dwarf smith who has served the Thorne family for three generations of the human lords. Loyal to the alliance, but worried about the succession crisis dragging dwarves into human wars.

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a dwarven smith, female, nearly two centuries old—ancient by human standards but in the prime of dwarven life, features carrying the settled confidence of someone who has mastered their craft. Broad, strong features with skin like weathered granite, a warm brown with deeper undertones in the shadows; old burn scars on cheek and jaw tell stories of forge-fires survived, worn as badges of honor rather than disfigurements. Small amber eyes deep-set beneath a heavy brow, sharp and assessing, catching forge-light with metallic gleams, the eyes of someone who sees the potential in raw metal. Fine sideburns of iron-gray frame a strong jaw; hair the color of old copper pulled back in a practical knot secured with a mithril clasp shaped like a hammer. Expression of calm authority and banked intensity, the look of a master who has nothing to prove but will prove it anyway. Wearing a leather smith's apron over a fine tunic of deep crimson—[[The Forgemasters Guild]] colors—the leather scarred by decades of sparks, a silver guild badge at the shoulder, bare arms showing corded muscle and more burn scars. Background of a great forge with orange-gold light, the suggestion of hanging tools and worked metal. Warm uplight from below suggesting forge-glow, picking out the texture of skin and the gleam of metal ornaments. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality. Fantasy dwarven master smith portrait.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
The great forge-hall of [[Hammerhall]], a vast underground cathedral of industry where fire and stone meet—ceiling lost in shadow above, supported by carved pillars showing the faces of legendary smiths. Seven dwarves at work around the central anvil, ranging from a young apprentice of perhaps sixty years with copper-red beard still thin to a white-bearded elder of four centuries whose hands still move with precision. Each wearing the heavy leather aprons and arm-guards of the forge, bare arms showing the burn-scars that are marks of mastery, beards braided and pinned back for safety in various clan styles. The central piece being worked: a blade still glowing white-hot, longer than any sword, covered in runes that seem to writhe—[[Grimhild's Commission]], the weapon against [[The Unnamed]]. Around them, the organized chaos of a working forge: hanging tools of every description, metal in various stages of completion cooling on stone shelves, barrel upon barrel of quenching oil and tempering solution. Ancestor-statues carved into the walls watching the work, their stone eyes seeming to glow with reflected fire. Massive bellows worked by apprentices, the deep wheeze of their breath feeding the forge-fire. Through an archway, a glimpse of the deeper halls—passage leading down into darkness. The atmosphere of sacred industry, of craft that is prayer, of a weapon being born that might save or doom the world. Lighting dominated by forge-fire from multiple sources—orange and gold playing across stone and skin, deep shadows in the corners, the whole scene a study in fire and determination. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, features, clothing, and cultural elements, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality. Fantasy dwarven forge ceremony illustration.

## Notes

Dwarves in Eldermyr are not neutral observers of the succession crisis—they have stakes, debts, and grudges that may draw them into the conflict. Their alliance with [[House Thorne]] is genuine but not unconditional. If the humans prove unworthy of trust, or if the conflict threatens the mountain holds, dwarven policy may shift.

[[Grimhild the Smith]]'s secret work on [[Grimhild's Commission]] represents perhaps the only hope against [[The Unnamed]]. That this weapon is being forged by dwarven hands says something about both dwarven craft and dwarven willingness to stand against the darkness when it matters.

The [[The Deep Delving]] remains sealed. What the dwarves found there—and whether it is connected to [[The Unnamed]]—is a closely guarded secret. Not even [[House Thorne]] knows the full truth.
