# Elves

> *"You measure time in years, in decades if you think long. We measure it in ages. Your kingdoms rise and fall like seasons to us—spring's hope, summer's glory, autumn's decline, winter's death, and spring again. Do not mistake our patience for indifference. We have seen what befalls those who act in haste. We have also seen what befalls those who wait too long."*
> — Elder Faelivrin of [[Myrkvid]], speaking to a human emissary

## Overview

The elves of Eldermyr are an ancient people whose connection to the Feywild sets them apart from all others. Comprising roughly 4% of the realm's population, they are divided into three distinct lineages: the scholarly High Elves who maintain small enclaves in civilized lands and connections to [[The Arcane Academy]], the secretive Wood Elves who dwell in [[Myrkvid]] and keep the Old Ways alongside the Northfolk humans, and the rarely-seen Drow who are whispered to live in the depths beneath the mountains. Elves view the current crisis with the long perspective of centuries—[[The Great War]] to them was yesterday, and they remember when the lands now called [[The Ashen Fields]] were verdant farmland. Some say the elves know secrets about [[The Unnamed]] that predate human memory, but they speak of such things only in their own tongue, in the deep places of the forest.

## Species Traits

### Core Traits
- **Creature Type:** Humanoid
- **Size:** Medium (5-6 feet tall)
- **Speed:** 30 feet (35 feet for Wood Elves)
- **Lifespan:** ~750 years average; 900+ years for exceptional individuals

### Ability Score Increases
Per D&D 5e (2024) rules, ability scores are determined by Background rather than species.

### Languages
- **Automatic:** Common, Elvish
- **Additional Options:** Sylvan (Feywild tongue), Undercommon (Drow)

### Racial Traits

#### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Drow have 120-foot Darkvision.

*Elven eyes retain something of the Feywild's eternal twilight. They see in conditions that blind lesser folk.*

#### Fey Ancestry
You have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Charmed condition.

*The Feywild blood in elvish veins resists manipulation. Charms that would enslave humans barely tickle an elf's consciousness.*

#### Keen Senses
You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

*Centuries of life attune elvish senses to subtleties others miss—the movement of a single leaf, the change in a person's breathing, the scent of rain three days hence.*

#### Trance
You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a Long Rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.

*Elves do not dream as humans do. In trance, they revisit memories—their own, or echoes of ancestral experience passed down through the blood.*

### Subraces/Lineages

#### High Elf (Quendi'silmë)
The eldest tradition, keepers of arcane lore.

**1st Level:** You know one Wizard cantrip of your choice (Intelligence-based).
**3rd Level:** You can cast *Detect Magic* once per Long Rest without a spell slot.
**5th Level:** You can cast *Misty Step* once per Long Rest without a spell slot.

*In Eldermyr, High Elves maintain small enclaves in [[The Crown Lands]] and have historic ties to [[The Arcane Academy]]. They are the most likely elves to interact with human society.*

#### Wood Elf (Quendi'taur)
Guardians of the wild places, fleet of foot.

**1st Level:** Your base Speed increases to 35 feet.
**3rd Level:** You can cast *Longstrider* on yourself once per Long Rest without a spell slot.
**5th Level:** You can cast *Pass without Trace* once per Long Rest without a spell slot.

*Wood Elves dwell in [[Myrkvid]] and the deeper reaches of [[The King's Wood]]. They follow the Old Ways and have little interest in human affairs—but they watch, and they remember.*

#### Drow (Quendi'mor)
The shadow-touched, dwellers in darkness.

**1st Level:** Your Darkvision increases to 120 feet.
**3rd Level:** You can cast *Faerie Fire* once per Long Rest without a spell slot (Charisma-based).
**5th Level:** You can cast *Darkness* once per Long Rest without a spell slot.

*Drow are rarely seen on the surface of Eldermyr. Rumors place their cities far beneath the mountains, perhaps connected to [[The Deep Delving]]. When they appear, it is never without purpose—and rarely with benevolent intent.*

## Physical Characteristics

### Appearance

- **Skin Coloring:** High Elves range from pale to bronze; Wood Elves tend toward olive and tan; Drow have obsidian-dark skin ranging from charcoal to deep purple
- **Hair:** High Elves favor gold, silver, copper, or black; Wood Elves often have earthy browns and autumn reds; Drow typically have white or silver hair

- **Adult Prime:** 100-600 years; centuries of productive life
- **Elder Characteristics:** Hair may silver (all lineages), features become more ethereal, eyes seem to look past the material world
- **Signs of Aging:** Subtle until the final century; then rapid decline; elves who feel death approaching often "fade"—walking into the Feywild to die

### Variations

**Lineage Differences:**
- **High Elves:** Often dress in robes and fine cloth; favor jewelry and carefully maintained appearance
- **Wood Elves:** Practical leathers and woven cloth; blend with forest environments; often have ritual scarification or leaf-tattoos
- **Drow:** Dark clothing, often with metallic accents; favor jewelry of black metal and pale gems; may file teeth to points

**Mixed Heritage:**
Half-elves exist but are rare. Children of elf-human unions may choose either parent's mechanical traits. They are often caught between worlds—too elvish for humans, too mortal for elves.

## Biology

### Physiology

- **Sleep Patterns:** Four-hour Trance replaces sleep; remain conscious and aware during rest
- **Environmental Tolerances:** Resistant to temperature extremes; do not suffer disease easily
- **Reproduction:** Extremely low fertility; pregnancy lasts about one year; twins are virtually unknown
- **Unique Abilities:** Fey Ancestry grants resistance to charm and sleep effects; some elves possess minor innate magic

### Life Cycle
- **Birth:** Rare and celebrated event; elvish communities may see only a handful of births per century
- **Childhood Duration:** ~100 years to full adulthood
- **Maturity Age:** 100 years (though physical maturity is earlier)
- **Adult Lifespan:** 600-750 years typical
- **Maximum Age:** ~900 years; death is often chosen through "fading"

### Health & Medicine
- **Common Ailments:** Few natural diseases affect elves; most deaths come from violence or grief
- **Resistances:** Disease, charm effects, sleep magic, poison (partial)
- **Vulnerabilities:** Deep emotional wounds can prove fatal; elves can die of grief
- **Dietary Requirements:** Flexible; can survive on very little

## Psychology

### Mental Characteristics
- **Cognitive Tendencies:** Long-term perspective; excellent memory spanning centuries; pattern recognition across ages
- **Emotional Expression:** Intense but controlled; emotions can span decades; grief and love both last centuries
- **Common Personality Patterns:** Patient, observant, occasionally condescending toward shorter-lived species
- **Learning Styles:** Contemplative; mastery over decades rather than rushed study

### Instincts
- **Preservation:** Strong drive to protect the natural world and elvish heritage
- **Wariness:** Instinctive caution around iron and certain sounds
- **Fey Call:** Some elves feel the pull of the Feywild, especially as they age

### Values
- **Beauty (Vanima):** Aesthetic appreciation pervades all elvish life
- **Memory (Yénië):** The past is present; ancestors are remembered clearly
- **Balance (Sérë):** Harmony between action and contemplation
- **Freedom (Cálë):** Enslavement or imprisonment is worse than death

### Stereotypes vs. Reality

**Stereotype:** Elves are arrogant and think themselves superior.
**Reality:** Elves have seen human civilizations rise and fall dozens of times. What humans call arrogance, elves call experience.

**Stereotype:** Elves are aloof and unemotional.
**Reality:** Elvish emotions run deep—so deep that they must be controlled. An elf who loses control of grief can die from it.

**Stereotype:** All elves love nature and forests.
**Reality:** High Elves may be as comfortable in cities as forests. Drow despise the surface world. Only Wood Elves fit the nature-loving archetype cleanly.

## Culture

### Society
- **Government Forms:** Consensus among elders (High Elves), council of seasons (Wood Elves), matriarchal houses (Drow)
- **Social Hierarchy:** Age and wisdom respected; no hereditary nobility among High or Wood Elves; rigid caste system among Drow
- **Family Structures:** Extended kinship networks; children raised by entire communities; romantic relationships span centuries
- **Gender Roles:** Largely egalitarian among High and Wood Elves; matriarchal hierarchy among Drow

### Values & Philosophy

**High Elves:**
- Preservation of knowledge and beauty
- Careful interaction with the younger races
- Arcane mastery as spiritual practice

**Wood Elves:**
- Protection of wild places
- The Old Ways—harmony with nature spirits
- Vigilance against corruption

**Drow:**
- Survival through strength and cunning
- House honor and advancement
- Lolth's web (their dark goddess)

### Religion & Spirituality

**High Elves:** Follow the Seldarine—the elvish pantheon led by Corellon Larethian, the Creator. They acknowledge [[The Faith of the Three]] but do not worship human gods.

**Wood Elves:** Follow the Old Ways—ancestor spirits, land spirits, and nature itself. They share this tradition with the Northfolk humans of [[The Northlands]]. [[The Spirit-Speakers]] count Wood Elves among their number.

**Drow:** Worship Lolth, the Spider Queen, a dark goddess who demands sacrifice, treachery, and absolute obedience. Drow who turn from Lolth face death or exile.

### Art & Expression
- **Visual Arts:** Intricate craftsmanship; living architecture grown from trees (Wood Elves) or crystal and silver (High Elves)
- **Music:** Haunting melodies; songs that can last days; music as magic
- **Literature:** Epic poetry spanning centuries; history recorded as song
- **Performance:** Dance and song intertwined; performance is worship

### Naming Conventions

#### Language & Phonetics
- **Language Name:** Quenya (Elvish)
- **Real-World Inspiration:** Tolkien's Elvish (Finnish/Latin influenced)
- **Phonetic Rules:** Flowing vowels, soft consonants, musical cadence; Drow names incorporate harsher sounds

#### Name Structure
- **First/Birth Names:** Given at birth; often contain meanings related to circumstances of birth
- **Family/Clan Names:** Lineage names passed down; describe family traits
- **Earned Names/Epithets:** Added for great deeds; may replace birth names

## History

### Origins
Elvish legend holds that the first elves awoke beside a starlit lake in the Feywild and walked into the material world when the world was young. They were ancient before humans existed, ancient before dwarves delved their first mines. The truth of their origin is lost even to elvish memory—or perhaps hidden.

### Historical Eras

**The Starlight Age (Mythic):**
The elves walked the world alone, building crystal cities and living in harmony with the fey. This ended when something—they do not speak of what—drove them from their greatest strongholds.

**The Age of Withdrawal (Ancient):**
As other peoples rose, elves retreated to enclaves. They watched humans build their kingdoms and fall, build and fall again. Some elves aided the younger races; others withdrew entirely.

**The Age of Silence (Present):**
Elves have become rare in human lands. The Wood Elves of [[Myrkvid]] maintain careful neutrality. The High Elves watch from their enclaves. The Drow plot in darkness. When [[The Mad King]] sought elvish aid against the darkness he foresaw, the elves refused—they had seen what lay beneath before, and they knew that human swords could not kill it.

### Relationship with Other Species
- **Dwarves:** Ancient tension, different approaches to craft; mutual respect at a distance
- **Humans:** Patronizing concern; humans live such short lives but cause such great changes
- **Halflings:** Gentle amusement; halflings are pleasant folk who don't meddle
- **Gnomes:** Kinship (Forest Gnomes especially welcome among Wood Elves)
- **Orcs:** Distrust; ancient enmities from wars humans have forgotten

### Diaspora
- **High Elves:** Small enclaves in [[The Crown Lands]], near [[The Arcane Academy]], in a few major cities
- **Wood Elves:** [[Myrkvid]], [[The King's Wood]], scattered forest holdings
- **Drow:** Rumored cities beneath [[The Ostmark Range]], possibly connected to [[The Deep Delving]]

## Homeland

### Traditional Lands

**High Elves:**
Once ruled much of what became [[The Crown Lands]]. Now maintain only a few hidden enclaves—the Tower of Stars near [[Aldersgate]], the Grove of Silver near [[Thornhall]].

**Wood Elves:**
[[Myrkvid]], the Dark Wood, has been Wood Elf territory since before humans entered [[The Northlands]]. They share the forest with human Northfolk but claim the deepest places.

**Drow:**
The cities of the Drow lie miles beneath the surface in the Underdark. Their holdings may connect to [[The Deep Delving]] and other forgotten places.

### Current Distribution
- **High Elves:** ~2,000 in Eldermyr; scattered among human cities and hidden enclaves
- **Wood Elves:** ~5,000 in [[Myrkvid]] and forest territories; rarely seen outside their lands
- **Drow:** Unknown; perhaps 10,000+ in the Underdark

## Society Details

### Government
- **High Elves:** Council of the eldest; decisions by consensus; no formal ruler
- **Wood Elves:** Council of Seasons (four elders representing aspects of the year); guided by omens
- **Drow:** Matriarchal houses competing for power; Matron Mothers rule through fear

### Economy
- **Common Occupations:** Artisans, scholars, guardians (Wood Elf wardens), priests, mages
- **Trade Goods:** Fine crafts, magical items, wine, preserved foods, information
- **Economic Philosophy:** Elves do not pursue wealth for its own sake; trade for necessity

### Military
- **Warrior Culture:** All elves learn combat; professionals are wardens (Wood Elf) or bladesingers (High Elf)
- **Preferred Weapons:** Longbow, longsword, spear; elegant weapons of elven make
- **Military Organization:** Militia systems; all elves fight when the homeland is threatened

### Education
- **Knowledge Transmission:** Oral tradition and experiential learning; master-student relationships lasting centuries
- **Formal Education:** Magic taught in towers (High Elf); forest lore learned by doing (Wood Elf)
- **Valued Knowledge:** History, magic, nature, craft traditions

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Humans:** "Beautiful and wise, but they look at us like we're children playing at being adults"
- **Dwarves:** "Flighty, concerned with pretty things, but their craft has merit"
- **Halflings:** "The Fair Folk are kind when you meet them, but strange—they see things we can't"
- **Orcs:** "Ancient enemies who remember wrongs we've forgotten—and they're always watching"

### Perception of Others
- **Humans:** Brief candles burning bright; capable of wonders and horrors; must be guided or at least watched
- **Dwarves:** Stubborn but reliable; their craft is crude but effective; better neighbors than many
- **Halflings:** Pleasant, harmless folk; good neighbors; refreshingly uncomplicated
- **Orcs:** Dangerous and brutal; the old wars are not forgotten; trust cautiously at best
- **Drow (by surface elves):** Traitors who fell into darkness; their existence shames all elvenkind

### Integration
High Elves integrate best, maintaining quarters in human cities while preserving their culture. Wood Elves rarely integrate, preferring their own lands. Drow do not integrate—they infiltrate.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Duty:** Sent to observe human affairs and report back
- **Exile:** Some leave after social transgression or personal tragedy
- **Curiosity:** Younger elves (under 200) may want to experience the world
- **Purpose:** Responding to prophecy, omen, or ancestral mandate
- **Drow Exile:** Those who flee Lolth's web may seek surface alliances

### Common Classes
- **Ranger:** Natural fit for Wood Elves; wardens of the wild
- **Wizard:** High Elves excel at arcane study
- **Rogue:** All lineages may produce scouts and spies
- **Cleric:** Servants of the Seldarine or Old Ways
- **Warlock:** Drow may bargain with dark powers

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Varied; some see adventurers as doing necessary work; others see them as abandoning duty
- **Cultural Expectations:** Represent your people well; do not shame the lineage
- **Support from Community:** Elves rarely adventure without some connection to home

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Think in longer timescales than humans; yesterday to you might be a decade ago
- Emotions run deep but are controlled; centuries of practice in self-mastery
- Other species' haste can be frustrating—or refreshingly vital
- Memory is vivid; you remember events from centuries ago as if they were yesterday
- Beauty and craft matter; sloppy work is offensive

### Cultural Touchstones
- Reverence for nature (Wood Elves) or arcane learning (High Elves)
- Songs and stories from centuries of memory
- Awareness of the Feywild's distant presence
- Caution about promises—elvish oaths are binding

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Not all elves are serene—some are passionate, reckless, or angry
- Elves can be wrong; centuries of life doesn't guarantee wisdom
- Cultural differences between lineages are significant
- Younger elves may reject tradition or embrace human ways

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **[[The Arcane Academy]] High Elf Loremaster:** An elvish scholar who has taught at the Academy for three human generations. Watches the succession crisis with concern—they remember similar conflicts and where they led.

2. **[[Myrkvid]] Wood Elf Warden:** Guardian of the Dark Wood who has noticed disturbing signs—the forest spirits are restless, speaking of something stirring in the south. Sent to investigate [[The Ashen Fields]] from a safe distance.

3. **Drow Exile Seeking Redemption:** A warrior who rejected Lolth's cruelty and fled to the surface. Now hunted by their house, they seek allies against the darkness—even if those allies are the "lesser races" they were taught to despise.

4. **High Elf Wanderer:** An elf of 400 years who has grown weary of watching humans repeat the same mistakes. Chooses to intervene directly rather than observe from a distance—much to their community's disapproval.

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a Wood Elf warden of [[Myrkvid]], female, four centuries old—ancient by human measure but in the long summer of elvish life. Angular features sharpened by time into something both beautiful and dangerous, skin the color of aged birch bark with subtle variations where light and shadow play, the faintest tracery of ritual scars in leaf-patterns along the cheekbones. Eyes of deep forest green with amber flecks, larger than human eyes, holding the patient focus of a predator at rest—watching, always watching, cataloging every detail. Tall pointed ears rising above the crown, the tips bearing three small copper rings marking decades of service, the ears themselves slightly angled forward in the alertness that never quite fades. Long hair the deep red-brown of autumn oak leaves, worn in the intricate warrior's braids of the northern watchers, small carved wooden beads woven in marking battles survived and duties honored. Expression of controlled intensity and banked wariness, the look of someone who has learned that the forest's peace can shatter in an instant. Wearing layered leather and living-leaf armor in greens and browns that would vanish into the forest, silver clan-pins at the shoulders, a hooded cloak pushed back, the edge of elaborate tattoo-work visible at the neck—the mark of the Warden's oath. Background of deep forest at twilight, shadows within shadows, the suggestion of watching eyes in the undergrowth. Lighting of dappled green-gold filtering through unseen leaves, catching the metallic elements and making the green eyes seem to glow with their own inner light.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
A gathering of Wood Elf elders at the Heart of [[Myrkvid]]—an ancient clearing where the trees themselves have grown into a living cathedral, branches interweaving overhead to form gothic arches of living wood. Four elves of varying ages—the youngest perhaps three centuries, the eldest nearing nine—seated on throne-roots that have grown from the Great Tree at the clearing's center. Each dressed in the distinct garb of their season: Spring in pale green with flower-crowned hair, Summer in deep verdant with sun-symbols woven in gold thread, Autumn in russet and bronze with harvest tokens, Winter in white and silver with frost-patterns that seem to move. Around them, a dozen Wood Elf wardens stand guard, bows unstrung but ready, faces painted with the spirit-marks of their clans. In the center of the council, a silver bowl filled with still water showing something that disturbs the elders—their reflections show not the forest but glimpses of [[The Ashen Fields]], the rising dead, the figure in [[The Blackened Crown]]. The Great Tree's bark bears carved runes that glow faintly with pale light—warnings and histories written over millennia. Through gaps in the living ceiling, stars visible despite the hour, as if the Feywild bleeds through in this sacred place. Motes of light drift like fireflies or tiny spirits. The atmosphere is one of deep antiquity and growing concern—the forest has seen much, but something new and terrible is stirring in the south. Lighting from the glowing runes and drifting motes, green-gold and silver, casting long shadows and picking out the alien beauty of elvish features. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, features, clothing, and cultural elements, dramatic atmosphere suggesting ancient wisdom facing new horror, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality.

## Notes

The elves of Eldermyr know more about [[The Unnamed]] than they have shared with humans. Their ancient histories speak of something that slept beneath the land—something the first shamans bound with rituals that became [[The Faith of the Three]]'s funeral rites. When [[The Mad King]] sought their counsel, they told him the truth: that the thing below could not be fought with armies or destroyed with magic. He did not listen.

The Wood Elves of [[Myrkvid]] maintain the Old Ways in part because those ways keep the ancient seals intact. [[The Spirit-Speakers]] who commune with ancestors include elvish practitioners whose memories stretch back to when the binding was first created. The current crisis threatens not just human political stability but something far older and more fundamental.

If the covenant fails completely—if [[The Unnamed]] fully awakens—the elves have contingencies. They remember how to close the ways to the Feywild and withdraw entirely from the mortal world. They hope it will not come to that, but they prepare nonetheless.
