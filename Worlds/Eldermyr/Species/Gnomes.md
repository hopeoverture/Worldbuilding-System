# Gnomes

> *"The dwarves think in centuries and plan in stone. The elves think in millennia and plan in... well, whatever elves plan in. We gnomes? We think in possibilities. What if this gear connected to that spring? What if this mushroom makes you invisible? What if we could talk to that squirrel? The universe is full of 'what ifs,' and we intend to answer as many as possible."*
> — Tinkmaster Finwhizzle Cogspark, explaining gnomish philosophy to a confused human patron

## Overview

Gnomes are a curious and clever people whose small stature belies their outsized impact on Eldermyr. Comprising roughly 1.5% of the realm's population, they are divided between two distinct cultures: the Rock Gnomes who work alongside dwarves in [[The Eastern March]] as engineers and artificers, and the Forest Gnomes who dwell in hidden communities within [[The King's Wood]] and [[Myrkvid]]. What unites all gnomes is their remarkable resistance to magic, their insatiable curiosity, and their tendency to view the world as an endless series of fascinating problems to solve. In the current crisis, gnomes are torn—Rock Gnomes fear for their dwarven allies, while Forest Gnomes sense disturbances in the natural order that trouble them deeply.

## Species Traits

### Racial Traits

#### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

*Gnomish eyes adapt to the conditions of their homes—dim workshops and deep forests alike.*

#### Gnomish Cunning
You have **Advantage** on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

*Something in gnomish blood resists arcane manipulation. Spells that would charm, confuse, or control other races often slide off gnomes like water off a duck. This trait has made gnomes valuable—and viewed with suspicion—throughout history.*

### Subraces/Lineages

#### Forest Gnome
Hidden dwellers of woodland places, friends to small creatures.

**Minor Illusion:** You know the *Minor Illusion* cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Speak with Small Beasts:** Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller Beasts.

*Forest Gnomes live in hidden communities within [[The King's Wood]], [[Myrkvid]], and other wild places. They rarely interact with larger folk and have developed a symbiotic relationship with the forest creatures.*

#### Rock Gnome
Inventive tinkerers who love mechanisms and understanding how things work.

**Artificer's Lore:** When you make a History check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you add double your proficiency bonus instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

**Tinker:** You know the *Mending* and *Prestidigitation* cantrips. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for them.

*Rock Gnomes are the inventors and engineers of the gnomish people. They work closely with dwarves in [[Hammerhall]] and other strongholds, bringing their unique perspective to craft and construction.*

- **Wonder (The Spark):** The world is full of marvels if you look

### Stereotypes vs. Reality

**Stereotype:** Gnomes are scatterbrained inventors who blow things up.
**Reality:** Gnomish inventions that work vastly outnumber failures. The failures are just more memorable.

**Stereotype:** Gnomes are frivolous and can't be serious.
**Reality:** Gnomes can be intensely focused—the problem is they focus on things that interest them, not necessarily what others consider important.

**Stereotype:** Forest Gnomes are just shy Rock Gnomes.
**Reality:** The two cultures are quite different. Forest Gnomes may be more reserved, but they have their own rich traditions and priorities.

## Culture

### Society
- **Government Forms:** Warren councils (both types); consensus-based; "whoever has the best idea" often wins
- **Social Hierarchy:** Extremely flat; status comes from clever solutions and interesting projects
- **Family Structures:** Extended families in warrens; children raised collectively

- The joy of creation and problem-solving
- Preservation of ancient techniques alongside new innovations

**Forest Gnomes:**
- Harmony with the natural world
- Protection of hidden places
- Knowledge through observation rather than experimentation
- Playful mischief balanced with serious duty

### Religion & Spirituality
**Garl Glittergold:** The gnomish deity, a trickster god of craft, humor, and gemstones. Gnomes honor him through cleverness, good jokes, and well-made things.

**The Deep Watch:** Rock Gnomes share with dwarves a wariness of what lies in the deep places. They acknowledge dark things exist and should not be disturbed.

**The Green Dream:** Forest Gnomes follow nature spirits similar to (or the same as) those honored by Wood Elves and the Old Ways. They see themselves as nature's clever children.

## History

### Origins
Gnomish origin stories claim they were born from gems in the earth or from the laughter of a trickster god or from the dreams of the forest itself. Different warrens have different stories, and gnomes generally don't worry about which is true—they're all good stories.

### Historical Eras

**The Age of Hiding (Ancient):**
When larger folk were dangerous and unpredictable, gnomes lived entirely underground or in deep forests. They watched, learned, and developed their characteristic cleverness.

**The Age of Emergence (Centuries Ago):**
As civilization stabilized, Rock Gnomes emerged to trade with dwarves and eventually humans. Forest Gnomes remained hidden but established communication with other forest peoples.

**The Present Day:**
Rock Gnomes are valued members of [[Hammerhall]] and other craft centers. Forest Gnomes watch the growing darkness from their hidden homes, troubled by what they sense. Both groups are concerned about the rising dead and the corruption spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]].

### Relationship with Other Species
- **Dwarves:** Close allies, especially Rock Gnomes; complementary skills in craft
- **Elves:** Distant kinship through Feywild connections; Forest Gnomes may share territories with Wood Elves
- **Humans:** Curiosity about human drive; often employed as craftsmen or consultants
- **Halflings:** Friendly; share small size and practical nature
- **Orcs:** Wary; gnomes rely on stealth and cleverness against physically superior threats

### Diaspora
- **Rock Gnomes:** Concentrated in [[The Eastern March]], particularly [[Hammerhall]] and [[Grimhold]]
- **Forest Gnomes:** Hidden in [[The King's Wood]], [[Myrkvid]], and scattered woodlands

## Homeland

### Traditional Lands

**Rock Gnomes:**
Share mountain territory with dwarves. The Warren of Cogspark beneath [[Hammerhall]] is the largest Rock Gnome settlement, home to perhaps 800 gnomes.

**Forest Gnomes:**
The Fernglow Warren in [[The King's Wood]] is the most accessible Forest Gnome community, though "accessible" is relative—you can only find it if the gnomes want you to.

### Current Distribution
- **Rock Gnomes:** ~3,000 in Eldermyr; concentrated in [[The Eastern March]]
- **Forest Gnomes:** ~2,000; scattered in forest territories; numbers uncertain
- **Urban Gnomes:** A few hundred in major cities; often craftsmen or scholars

## Society Details

### Government
- **Leadership Selection:** The gnome with the best solution to the current problem leads; highly situational
- **Decision-making:** Consensus through argument and demonstration
- **Laws and Justice:** Customary; exile from the warren for serious betrayals; shaming for lesser offenses

### Economy
- **Common Occupations:** Tinker, inventor, artificer (Rock); herbalist, scout, animal handler (Forest)
- **Trade Goods:** Clockwork devices, precision tools, alchemical supplies (Rock); rare herbs, information, guide services (Forest)
- **Economic Philosophy:** Trade for what you need to pursue what interests you

### Military
- **Warrior Culture:** Defensive only; gnomes fight to protect warrens, not to conquer
- **Preferred Weapons:** Crossbows, mechanical traps, illusions, escape routes
- **Military Organization:** Warren militia; everyone contributes to defense

### Education
- **Knowledge Transmission:** Apprenticeships, collective learning, experimentation
- **Formal Education:** The "Question Halls" where young gnomes ask questions until exhausted
- **Valued Knowledge:** "How does it work?" is the core question

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Humans:** "Clever little folk; their devices are amazing when they work; keep them away from things you don't want taken apart"
- **Dwarves:** "Strange but useful; think in ways we don't; good to have around for problems that need new thinking"
- **Elves:** "Distant cousins playing at understanding the world; their curiosity is endearing"
- **Halflings:** "Like us but more... intense? Good neighbors, though loud."

### Perception of Others
- **Dwarves:** Excellent partners; appreciate the precision even if they lack imagination
- **Elves:** Interesting; they know things but don't share; possible source of knowledge
- **Humans:** Chaotic, fascinating, short-lived; produce interesting problems
- **Halflings:** Pleasant neighbors; good cooks; understand the value of a comfortable burrow
- **Orcs:** Dangerous; avoid or outsmart; do not engage directly

### Integration
Rock Gnomes integrate well with dwarven communities and can live comfortably in human cities. Forest Gnomes rarely integrate, preferring to observe from hiding.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Curiosity:** "What's beyond that mountain?" is reason enough
- **Research:** Seeking knowledge, artifacts, or specimens
- **Necessity:** Warren threatened; must find help or solutions
- **Invention:** Need materials, inspiration, or test conditions for projects
- **Exile:** Made a mistake; must stay away from home for a while

### Common Classes
- **Artificer:** Perfect fit for Rock Gnomes; craft and magic combined
- **Wizard:** Gnomish Cunning protects a fragile spellcaster
- **Rogue:** Stealth and cleverness synergize with gnomish traits
- **Ranger:** Forest Gnomes make excellent wilderness experts
- **Bard:** The intersection of knowledge and performance

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Adventures mean discoveries; returning gnomes are expected to share findings
- **Cultural Expectations:** Document everything; bring back interesting things; don't get killed stupidly
- **Support from Community:** Warrens provide equipment and expect reports

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Ask "how does that work?" about everything
- Get excited about unexpected discoveries
- Think around problems rather than through them
- Remember that gnomish lifespans mean long-term patience is possible
- Treat failure as information rather than defeat

### Cultural Touchstones
- Tinkering during downtime
- Collecting interesting objects and observations
- Complex explanations that lose audiences
- Comfortable burrow-living preferences

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Not all gnomes are inventors—some are historians, artists, or warriors
- Gnomish focus can be impressive, not just comedic
- Forest Gnomes are not shy Rock Gnomes—their culture is distinct
- Intelligence can manifest as wisdom, not just cleverness

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **[[Hammerhall]] Artificer:** Working with [[Grimhild the Smith]] on mysterious projects you're not fully informed about. You suspect it involves something terrible—and something wonderful.

2. **Forest Gnome Warden:** The animals of [[The King's Wood]] are frightened. Something is wrong in the south. You've been sent to investigate, leaving your hidden home for the first time.

3. **Gnomish Investigator:** Hired by noble houses to solve mysteries their human agents can't. Small size means access to places others can't go. Gnomish Cunning means magical defenses don't stop you.

4. **Exile Inventor:** Your latest creation caused... an incident. The warren politely suggested you travel for a few decades until it's forgotten. Now your skills are for hire—what could go wrong?

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a Rock Gnome artificer, female, approximately 180 years old—young adult by gnomish standards, carrying the bright-eyed enthusiasm of someone who hasn't yet run out of questions. Large head proportional to small body, with a broad forehead suggesting the intelligence within; skin pale from workshop life with soot marks at the temple and a small burn scar on the chin worn as a badge of experimentation. Enormously bright blue eyes magnified slightly by the brass-rimmed goggles pushed up on her forehead, eyes that seem to be actively cataloging everything in view, pupils dilated with perpetual curiosity. Wild white hair that seems to have its own opinions about direction, partially tamed into a practical bun secured with what appears to be a clockwork hairpin that slowly ticks. A prominent nose that dominates the face in characteristic gnomish fashion, button mouth usually quirked in a half-smile at some private joke or realization. Expression of delighted concentration, the look of someone who just solved a problem and is already thinking about the next one. Wearing a leather artificer's apron covered in tool pockets over a neat but ink-stained blouse, magnifying lenses on swivel arms attached to her collar, copper [[The Forgemasters Guild|Forgemasters Guild]] apprentice badge at the shoulder, grease stains that will never fully wash out. Background suggesting a workshop with blurred shapes of half-finished devices. Warm golden light from forge-fire and oil lamps, catching the brass elements and making the goggles gleam.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
The interior of a Forest Gnome warren hidden within [[The King's Wood]]—a network of chambers carved into the root system of an ancient oak, the walls living wood that has grown around gnomish habitation over centuries. Five Forest Gnomes gathered around a shallow pool of still water that serves as a scrying device, their faces illuminated from below by soft phosphorescent moss. Each gnome dressed in clothing that mimics the forest—woven leaf patterns, acorn buttons, bark-textured leather—in colors of moss green, oak brown, and mushroom gray. The eldest with a long white beard braided with tiny mushrooms, touching the water's surface to show images that trouble all who see them: glimpses of [[The Ashen Fields]], the rising dead, wrongness spreading through the earth. Around them, the evidence of Forest Gnome life: small animals (a dormouse, two chipmunks, a robin) watching from perches as if participating in the council; shelves of preserved herbs and collected oddities; tiny doors leading to other chambers; bioluminescent fungi providing soft blue-green light. Through a window-like opening in the roots, a glimpse of forest at twilight, fireflies beginning to emerge. The atmosphere of ancient secrecy facing new threat, of a hidden people who can no longer afford to simply hide. Mixed lighting—the warm glow of the scrying pool, the cool blue of the moss, the golden sunset through the opening—creating a sense of peaceful home invaded by worried purpose. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, features, clothing, and cultural elements, dramatic atmosphere suggesting hidden wisdom confronting spreading evil, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality.

## Notes

Gnomish Cunning makes gnomes valuable in a world where [[The Unnamed]]'s corruption may spread through magical means. Those who resist charm and mental manipulation are precious allies—or dangerous wild cards who can't be easily controlled.

Rock Gnomes in [[Hammerhall]] are likely aware of [[Grimhild's Commission]], even if they don't know all details. Their skills may be crucial to completing it. The question is whether they'll be told the full truth about what threatens the realm.

Forest Gnomes feel the corruption spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]] through their animal friends and their connection to the land. They may know things about [[The Unnamed]] that even the elves have forgotten—old stories, old warnings, possibly old solutions.
