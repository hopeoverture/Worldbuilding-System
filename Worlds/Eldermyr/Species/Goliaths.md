# Goliaths

> *"We do not understand your fighting. You kill each other over who wears a metal hat. Meanwhile, the mountain endures. The wind endures. The stone endures. When your war is done and your kingdoms dust, we will still be walking the high places, counting ourselves against the peaks. But if your war disturbs the mountains—if your dead rise even in our sacred heights—then we will descend. And you will learn why we do not need to fight over metal hats."*
> — Stonekeeper Vaunea Thunderbrow, addressing a Thorne emissary

## Overview

Goliaths are a nomadic people who dwell in the highest reaches of [[The Greycrowns]] and [[The Ostmark Range]], where the air thins and other species cannot easily follow. Comprising perhaps 2% of Eldermyr's population, they are the least integrated of the realm's peoples—not from hostility but from fundamental indifference to lowlander affairs. Goliaths measure themselves against the mountains, not against thrones. They descend to trade, occasionally to hire out as laborers or guards, but always return to the heights. The current succession crisis means nothing to them. The rising dead in [[The Ashen Fields]]—the corruption of the natural order—concerns them greatly. If the plague of undeath spreads to their mountains, goliaths will act. And when goliaths act, the ground shakes.

## Species Traits

### Core Traits
- **Creature Type:** Humanoid
- **Size:** Medium (7-8 feet tall)
- **Speed:** 35 feet (fastest base speed of any species)
- **Lifespan:** ~80 years; few reach old age

### Ability Score Increases
Per D&D 5e (2024) rules, ability scores are determined by Background rather than species.

- **Additional Options:** Dwarvish (from mountain neighbors), Orc (from occasional contact)

### Racial Traits

#### Large Form (5th Level)
Starting at 5th level, as a Bonus Action, you can change your size to Large for 10 minutes. This change lasts until you use a Bonus Action to end it or until you are incapacitated.

While Large:
- You have Advantage on Strength checks
- Your Speed increases by 10 feet

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

*Goliath bloodlines carry echoes of true giants. When needed, they can tap into this heritage, briefly becoming something more than mortal.*

#### Powerful Build
You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

*Even at normal size, goliaths are built to handle burdens that would crush smaller folk.*

#### Giant Ancestry
Choose one of the following traits, representing which giant bloodline runs strongest in you:

**Cloud's Jaunt (Cloud Giant):** As a Bonus Action, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Uses equal your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.

**Fire's Burn (Fire Giant):** When you hit with an attack and deal damage, you can also deal 1d10 fire damage. Uses equal your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.

**Frost's Chill (Frost Giant):** When you hit with an attack and deal damage, you can deal 1d6 cold damage and reduce the target's speed by 10 feet until your next turn. Uses equal your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.

**Hill's Tumble (Hill Giant):** When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack, you can knock it prone. Uses equal your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.

**Stone's Endurance (Stone Giant):** When you take damage, use your Reaction to roll 1d12 + CON modifier and reduce that damage. Uses equal your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.

**Storm's Thunder (Storm Giant):** When you take damage from a creature within 60 feet, use your Reaction to deal 1d8 thunder damage to it. Uses equal your Proficiency Bonus per Long Rest.

*Different goliath tribes claim descent from different giant types, though all recognize kinship.*

**Reality:** Goliath competition extends to all skills—climbing, crafting, lore-keeping. They respect excellence in any form.

**Stereotype:** Goliaths are antisocial loners.
**Reality:** Goliaths are deeply social within their tribes. They're reserved with outsiders because outsiders rarely earn trust.

**Reality:** Goliaths care intensely about the natural order. Threats to the mountains or perversions of life and death concern them greatly.

## Culture

## History

### Origins
Goliath legends claim descent from true giants—stone giants primarily, though different tribes claim different lineages. Whether literal truth or metaphor, goliaths carry giant blood that manifests in their size, resilience, and ability to grow to Large size.

### Historical Eras

**The High Times (Ancient):**
Goliaths dwelt in the mountains, following herds, competing among themselves, having no contact with lowlanders who couldn't survive at such heights.

**The First Descent (Centuries Ago):**
Climate shifts or resource needs brought goliaths lower, where they encountered humans and dwarves. Initial conflicts gave way to cautious trade.

**The Present Day:**
Goliaths maintain traditional mountain life but have established seasonal trading relationships with [[Vindrheim]] and mountain communities in [[The Eastern March]]. Some goliaths descend to work as laborers, guards, or mercenaries, but always return to the heights.

### Relationship with Other Species
- **Dwarves:** Respect; both love stone; trade relationships exist; occasional competition
- **Humans:** Useful for trade; confusing with their politics; individually variable
- **Orcs:** Kinship of strength; competitors rather than enemies; some trade beyond [[Ostmark Pass]]
- **Elves:** Rarely encountered; mystifying creatures of the lowlands
- **Halflings/Gnomes:** Barely registered; too small to be threats or competitors

### Diaspora
Goliaths have not diaspora'd in any meaningful sense. They are mountain people who live in the mountains. Individuals may travel, but the tribes remain in their traditional ranges.

## Homeland

### Traditional Lands
The high peaks of [[The Greycrowns]] and [[The Ostmark Range]], above the tree line where the air is thin and the stone is eternal.

**Cloud Tribe Territory:** The highest peaks of [[The Greycrowns]], where clouds gather
**Stone Tribe Territory:** The central ranges, most accessible to lowlanders
**Frost Tribe Territory:** The northernmost heights, where permanent snow rules

### Current Distribution
- **Mountain Tribes:** ~3,000 goliaths in traditional territories
- **Lowland Individuals:** Perhaps 200 at any time, working or trading
- **Permanent Emigrants:** Extremely rare; goliaths who leave permanently are considered lost

## Society Details

### Government
- **Leadership Selection:** Chieftains prove themselves through the Great Challenge; serve until challenged and defeated
- **Decision-making:** Tribal councils; all adults may speak; chief decides if consensus fails
- **Laws and Justice:** Customary law; disputes settled by competition; exile for serious betrayals

### Economy
- **Common Occupations:** Herder, hunter, crafter, scout, shaman
- **Trade Goods:** Furs, mountain herbs, precious stones, labor
- **Economic Philosophy:** Take what the mountain offers; trade for what it doesn't

### Military
- **Warrior Culture:** All goliaths are warriors when needed; no standing army
- **Preferred Weapons:** Greataxe, maul, javelin; weapons that use their strength
- **Military Organization:** Tribal warbands; rarely mobilize except against existential threats

### Education
- **Knowledge Transmission:** Oral tradition; mentorship; learning by doing
- **Formal Education:** None; the Proving tests all necessary skills
- **Valued Knowledge:** Survival, climbing, herding, crafting, lore of the peaks

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Humans:** "Giants' children who walk above us all; trade fairly but don't provoke them"
- **Dwarves:** "Worthy competitors; they understand stone differently than we do"
- **Orcs:** "Strong and honorable; good to fight alongside or against"
- **Elves:** "Strange tall folk from the heights; rarely seen; never understood"

### Perception of Others
- **Dwarves:** Respect; they understand craft and stone; good trading partners
- **Humans:** Confusing; they fight over things that don't matter; some individuals worthy
- **Orcs:** Kin in strength if not blood; honor their warriors; compete with respect
- **Elves:** Pretty lowlanders who live too long and talk too much
- **Halflings/Gnomes:** Too small to matter

### Integration
Goliaths do not integrate; they visit. Individual goliaths may spend years in lowland society, but almost all return to the mountains eventually. Those who stay permanently are mourned as lost.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **The Proving:** Some goliaths take the world itself as their Proving ground
- **Trade Mission:** Sent to establish or maintain trading relationships
- **Exile:** Failed the tribe in some way; must earn return through deeds
- **Curiosity:** Want to measure themselves against lowland challenges
- **Threat Response:** Something threatens the mountains; must investigate or ally

### Common Classes
- **Barbarian:** Natural fit; rage and giant ancestry combine powerfully
- **Fighter:** Disciplined strength; competitive excellence
- **Ranger:** Mountain wilderness expertise extends to other terrains
- **Cleric:** Shamans of Kavaki or storm spirits
- **Paladin:** Oath-bound to protect the tribe or natural order

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Adventuring is an extended Proving; success brings honor
- **Cultural Expectations:** Achieve something worth remembering; don't shame the tribe
- **Support from Community:** Tribe provides equipment; expects stories and goods in return

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Measure everything against challenges; "is this harder than climbing Storm Peak?"
- Discomfort in enclosed spaces and at low altitudes
- Respect for strength and excellence in any form
- Impatience with inefficiency and politics
- Deep loyalty once trust is earned

### Cultural Touchstones
- Achievement tattoos and their stories
- Competitive mindset toward everything
- Comfort in high places and open air
- Respect for natural cycles of life and death

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Competition includes mental challenges, not just physical
- Goliaths can be patient when patience is the winning strategy
- Cultural values don't preclude individual variation
- Not all goliaths are stoic—some are quite expressive

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **Extended Proving:** You've chosen to prove yourself against the entire world, not just your tribe's challenges. Cities, dungeons, armies—all just different peaks to climb.

2. **Tribal Envoy:** The shamans have seen darkness spreading from the lowlands. You've been sent to investigate, find allies, and report back. The tribe must know if they need to descend.

3. **Exile Seeking Redemption:** You failed a crucial challenge and were cast out. Now you wander lowland roads, seeking achievements grand enough to earn return—or a new people worth joining.

4. **Storm Speaker's Student:** You hear the voices in the thunder. Your teacher sent you down to learn what the lowlanders know of the darkness beneath [[The Ashen Fields]]—the spirits are troubled.

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a goliath shaman, female, approximately fifty years old—elder by goliath standards, having survived what most don't, carrying the weathered dignity of one who speaks with mountain spirits. Massive features even for her species, standing over seven feet with shoulders broader than most humans are tall; gray-brown skin with distinctive mottled patterns like veined granite, the darker patches across cheekbones and brow giving the impression of a face carved from living stone. Bony protrusions along the browridge and jawline, naturally occurring like geological formations, some adorned with small carved runes. Deep-set blue eyes that seem to look through rather than at, holding the faraway gaze of someone who sees the wind. Head shaved smooth in the shamanic tradition, the bare scalp revealing the topography of bone ridges and lithodermic patches. Achievement tattoos covering the visible skin—on the temples, around the bony ridges, down the neck—each one telling a story of trials survived and spirits spoken with. Expression of profound patience and distant attention, simultaneously present and elsewhere. Wearing layered furs from mountain beasts over a simple leather vest, tokens and talismans hanging from leather cords—a carved stone, a feather, a crystal that catches the light—the marks of a storm-speaker. Background of snow-capped peaks at dawn, the first light catching the stone and ice. Cold blue light of mountain morning, picking out the granite tones of skin and the glitter of ice crystals on the furs.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
A goliath Proving ceremony at the summit of a [[Greycrowns]] peak—the moment when a young goliath becomes an adult through trial and witness. The scene unfolds on a flat stone platform at the mountain's crown, carved by generations of such ceremonies, surrounded by the endless sky. A young goliath, barely past childhood, stands at the platform's edge having just completed a grueling climb, body still showing signs of exertion but head held high. Before them, a semicircle of tribal elders—five goliaths ranging from middle-aged warriors to ancient shamans—sit on carved stone seats that have served this purpose for centuries. The chieftain stands, massive even among goliaths, raising a ceremonial weapon to acknowledge the Proving complete. Behind the platform, three other young goliaths await their turn, watching with competitive intensity. The achievement tattoo master prepares inks and needles, ready to mark the new adult with their first permanent symbol of accomplishment. Around the edges of the platform, the rest of the tribe—perhaps thirty goliaths of all ages—watches in formal silence, children held by parents, warriors standing at attention, elders remembering their own Provings. Above them all, the sky stretches infinite in mountain blues and purples, the thin air making the stars visible even in daylight. Prayer flags in tribal colors snap in the eternal wind. On the horizon, other peaks of [[The Greycrowns]] march into the distance, named for ancestors who became mountains. The atmosphere of sacred tradition, of generations connected, of individual triumph witnessed by community. Lighting of high altitude: intense sun, deep blue sky, stark shadows, everything oversaturated with the clarity of thin air. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on skin, features, clothing, and cultural elements, dramatic atmosphere of ancient ceremony at the top of the world, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality.

## Notes

Goliaths' indifference to the succession crisis doesn't mean they're unaware. They trade with lowlanders, hear news, understand that conflict is coming. They simply don't care who rules. What they care about is whether the conflict will spread to their mountains—and whether the unnatural plague spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]] threatens the natural order they're sworn to protect.

Storm-speakers among the Cloud tribe have been seeing troubling omens. The spirits are disturbed. Something is wrong with death itself. If this corruption reaches the high places—if the goliath dead begin to rise—the tribes will descend in force. And when goliaths descend in force, even great houses take notice.

Individual goliaths working in lowland society may become key bridges between the tribes and the powers fighting [[The Unnamed]]. A goliath adventurer who earns respect in both worlds could be invaluable—or could find themselves torn between tribal duty and personal loyalty to lowlander companions.
