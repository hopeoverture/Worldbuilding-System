# Halflings

> *"The Big Folk think we don't notice what's happening—all their wars and politics and crowns. We notice. We just know there's nothing we can do about it except keep our heads down, our larders full, and our doors open for neighbors who need shelter. When the storm passes, we'll still be here. We always are."*
> — Rosie Goodbarrel of [[Millford]], to her grandchildren

## Overview

The halflings of Eldermyr are a peaceful, pastoral people who have carved out quiet lives in the fertile valleys and gentle hills of [[The Crown Lands]]. Comprising roughly 3% of the realm's population, they are concentrated in agricultural villages along [[The Kingswater]] and in market towns like [[Crossford]]. Unlike the other species, halflings have never sought power, never built empires, never waged great wars. They farm, they brew, they trade, they raise large families, and they endure. Human lords barely notice them, which suits halflings perfectly. The current succession crisis fills halflings with dread—not because they care who wears [[The Iron Crown]], but because wars mean armies marching through farmland, burning crops, and pressing "volunteers" into service.

## Species Traits

### Core Traits
- **Creature Type:** Humanoid
- **Size:** Small (about 3 feet tall)
- **Speed:** 30 feet
- **Lifespan:** ~150 years average; 170+ years for exceptional individuals

### Ability Score Increases
Per D&D 5e (2024) rules, ability scores are determined by Background rather than species.

### Languages
- **Automatic:** Common, Halfling
- **Additional Options:** Elvish (from forest neighbors), Dwarvish (from trading)

### Racial Traits

#### Brave
You have **Advantage** on saving throws to avoid or end the **Frightened** condition.

*Halflings are not fearless—they fear plenty. But something in their nature allows them to act despite fear. When dragons land or armies march, halflings tremble—and then do what must be done.*

#### Halfling Nimbleness
You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you.

*Small size has advantages. Halflings slip through crowds, between legs, and around obstacles that would stop larger folk. In battle, this becomes the art of not being where the sword falls.*

#### Lucky
When you roll a 1 on a d20 for a D20 Test, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

*Halfling luck is famous throughout Eldermyr. Whether divine providence, Feywild blessing, or simply excellent timing, things tend to work out for halflings—barely, often messily, but they work out.*

#### Naturally Stealthy
You can take the Hide action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

*When you're three feet tall, every human is cover. Halflings learn early that being overlooked is a survival skill.*

### Subraces/Lineages

While D&D 5e (2024) doesn't include halfling subraces mechanically, Eldermyr recognizes cultural distinctions:

#### Lightfoot Halflings
The majority in [[The Crown Lands]]. Friendly, outgoing, and excellent at going unnoticed when they wish.

#### Stout Halflings
Stockier, with rumored dwarven ancestry. More common in communities near [[The Eastern March]]. Slightly hardier and less afraid of underground spaces.

## History

### Origins
Halfling origins are obscure—they have no creation myths of their own, simply saying "we've always been here." Some scholars theorize Feywild origins (explaining their luck); others suggest they emerged alongside humans as a smaller, more cautious branch.

### Historical Eras

**The Wandering (Ancient):**
Before settling, halflings wandered in small family groups, finding places where the Big Folk weren't. This ended when they discovered the gentle lands that became [[The Crown Lands]].

**The Settling (500+ years ago):**
Halflings established their villages in the hills and river valleys. Human kings barely noticed them, which was perfect.

**The Quiet Centuries:**
Halflings watched human kingdoms rise and fall, wars come and go. They farmed, married, had children, and endured. [[The Great War]] brought soldiers marching through—halflings hid, helped where they could, and rebuilt afterward.

**The Present Fear:**
The succession crisis threatens everything halflings value. Armies may march again. The dead rise in [[The Ashen Fields]]. [[Crossford]], the halfling trade center, sits at the crossroads between all the powers. Halflings are very, very worried.

### Relationship with Other Species
- **Humans:** The Big Folk; tolerated, sometimes befriended; halflings serve as tenants, merchants, or servants
- **Elves:** Beautiful and frightening; rarely encountered; halflings sense the Feywild in them
- **Dwarves:** Good trading partners; appreciate dwarf craftsmanship and brewing
- **Gnomes:** Kin of a sort; share small size and Feywild connections
- **Orcs:** Terrifying; halflings hide when orcs come
- **Others:** Various; halflings judge individuals by behavior

### Diaspora
Halflings originated somewhere in the central lowlands and spread to suitable farming areas. They rarely travel far without good reason.

## Homeland

### Traditional Lands
The halfling heartland lies in the river valleys and gentle hills of [[The Crown Lands]], particularly along [[The Kingswater]].

**[[Greenhollow]]:** Pastoral community known for sheep and wool; traditional burrow-homes
**[[Crossford]]:** Market town at the crossroads; significant halfling merchant community

### Current Distribution
- **Majority Populations:** River villages of [[The Crown Lands]]; [[Crossford]] merchant quarter
- **Minority Communities:** Most larger human settlements have a halfling neighborhood
- **Urban vs. Rural:** Prefer rural, but some have adapted to town life

## Society Details

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Humans:** "Good folk, if a bit simple; excellent cooks and servants; harmless"
- **Elves:** "The quiet little people who tend the land well; more interesting than humans give them credit for"
- **Dwarves:** "Fine brewers and good neighbors; know how to appreciate a well-made thing"
- **Orcs:** "Weak, soft, barely worth noticing—but their livestock are easy targets"

### Perception of Others

- **Elves:** Beautiful and terrifying; very polite when encountered
- **Dwarves:** Good folk; trustworthy traders; make excellent tools
- **Gnomes:** Cousins of a sort; clever but strange
- **Orcs:** Hide. Now. Don't come out until they're gone.

### Integration
Halflings integrate by being useful and unobtrusive. In human cities, they form tight-knit neighborhoods, maintain their culture, and find roles that suit their size and temperament.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Catastrophe:** Home destroyed; family killed; nothing left to lose
- **Wanderlust:** Rare but real; some halflings inherit the old wandering urge
- **Duty:** Sent to protect family interests or represent the community
- **Curiosity:** Want to see what's beyond the hills (then go home and tell stories)
- **Necessity:** Someone has to do something, and no one else is stepping up

### Common Classes
- **Rogue:** Natural fit; stealth, nimbleness, and luck combine well
- **Bard:** Storytelling tradition transfers; halfling courage through song
- **Ranger:** Scout and protector; watches for danger to warn others
- **Cleric:** Shepherd's servant; healer and comforter
- **Fighter:** Rare but possible; the halfling who decided enough was enough

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Adventurers are oddities—viewed with concern, then pride if they return safely
- **Cultural Expectations:** Don't forget where you came from; send money home; come back to tell stories
- **Support from Community:** Family helps equip departing halflings; expects to share in success

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Home is never far from your thoughts; describe it often
- Food matters—always know where the next meal is coming from
- Fear is natural and not shameful; courage is acting despite it
- Family connections are frequent topics of conversation
- Measure comfort in practical terms—soft beds, warm fires, full bellies

### Cultural Touchstones
- Meals as social events and markers of time
- Large extended families with complicated relationships
- Appreciation for simple pleasures done well
- Distrust of grand schemes and politics

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Not all halflings are jolly—some are cynical, bitter, or grieving
- Halfling courage is real; they can be fierce when pressed
- Some halflings reject their culture—wanderers, adventurers, city dwellers
- Intelligence is not measured by size or lifestyle

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **[[Millford]] Refugee:** Your village was burned by soldiers during the succession conflict. Now you have nothing but survival skills, a burning need for vengeance—or justice—and the determination to make sure it never happens again.

2. **[[Crossford]] Merchant's Agent:** You travel between the great houses, carrying messages and goods. You see everything, hear everything, and report to... well, that's the question, isn't it? Maybe yourself, now.

3. **The Burglar:** Discovered you have a talent for getting into places uninvited. Fell in with a bad crowd, then a better one. Now you use your skills for... what? Survival? Wealth? Helping people? Still figuring it out.

4. **[[The Grey Wardens]] Scout:** Someone needs to watch the borders of [[The Ashen Fields]] without being seen. A halfling who can hide behind a blade of grass and run between a risen dead's legs is surprisingly valuable.

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a halfling farmer, male, early sixties by halfling reckoning—barely middle-aged for his people, carrying the comfortable weight of a well-fed life and the weathered look of someone who works outdoors. Round, friendly face with sun-browned skin and rosy cheeks, laugh lines around the eyes and mouth, a nose reddened by weather, the look of someone who smiles often. Warm brown eyes holding a mixture of simple contentment and sharp observational intelligence—there's more going on behind those eyes than strangers assume. Curly chestnut hair going gray at the temples, worn slightly long, a neatly trimmed set of sideburns (fashionable among halfling men). Expression of cautious welcome, the look of someone deciding whether a newcomer is friend or threat. Wearing a well-made but practical waistcoat of forest green over a cream linen shirt, a copper pipe-leaf pin at the collar marking him as a respected family head, buttons of carved bone, the clothes of someone prosperous by halfling standards but not ostentatious. Behind one pointed ear, a sprig of pipe-weed leaf tucked for later. Background of a sunny hillside with the round door of a burrow-home visible, the golden light of late afternoon in [[The Crown Lands]]. Warm lighting suggesting harvest time, picking out the texture of weathered skin and comfortable cloth.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
A halfling village market day in [[Crossford]]—a bustling square where the Small People have set up their stalls among the larger human vendors, creating a strange two-tiered marketplace. Eight halflings of various ages working the market: an elderly matriarch selling wheels of cheese from a low cart, her grandchildren running underfoot; a middle-aged baker displaying golden loaves of bread at perfect halfling-height; a pair of young men rolling barrels of ale with practiced efficiency; a halfling woman haggling with a human merchant who must kneel to meet her eyes. The stalls are sized for halflings but decorated to catch human attention—colorful awnings, baskets of produce, hanging strings of dried herbs. Around them, the mixed crowd of [[Crossford]]: humans towering overhead, a dwarf examining the metalwork on a halfling-made pot, children of both species playing together. In the background, the architecture of the crossroads town—human buildings alongside round-doored halfling establishments built into a hillside. The atmosphere of prosperous bustle, of a community that has found its niche, of folk who know their business and do it well. But on some faces, visible worry—soldiers in noble livery visible at the edge of the square, the tensions of the succession crisis touching even this peaceful scene. Golden afternoon light suggesting autumn harvest market, warm and inviting but with long shadows beginning to creep.

## Notes

Halflings represent what Eldermyr stands to lose if the succession crisis becomes full-scale war. They have no stake in who wears [[The Iron Crown]]—they just want to be left alone to live their lives. But armies march through farmland, soldiers requisition grain, and refugees flee in all directions.

The halflings of [[Crossford]] are particularly vulnerable. The town sits at the junction of major roads, a natural gathering point for armies heading in any direction. Smart halflings are already stockpiling food, preparing hiding places, and making contingency plans. Some are even—quietly, reluctantly—learning to fight.

If [[The Unnamed]] breaks free and the dead overrun the realm, halflings will flee. They've done it before, in the Wandering days. But every generation since has worked to make homes worth defending. Running means losing everything. Again.
