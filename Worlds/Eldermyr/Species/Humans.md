# Humans

> *"We are the brief candle that burns brightest. While elves deliberate and dwarves endure, we act. We build, we destroy, we love, we hate—all with an urgency the longer-lived can never understand. Perhaps that is why the gods gave us dominion over this realm. Or perhaps it is why we will be its ruin."*
> — From *On the Nature of the Mortal Races*, by [[Archmagister Corwin Ashford]]

## Overview

Humans are the dominant species of [[Eldermyr]], comprising roughly 65% of the realm's population and holding virtually all political power. They are the driving force behind the current succession crisis, the builders of the great castles and cities, and the architects of both the realm's greatest achievements and its most terrible failures. While other species have their strengths—the longevity of elves, the resilience of dwarves—humans possess an adaptability and ambition that has allowed them to spread across every region and climb to every position of power. The current conflict between [[House Valdren]], [[House Thorne]], [[House Karath]], and [[The Faith of the Three]] is an entirely human affair, though its consequences will touch every soul in the realm.

## Species Traits

### Core Traits
- **Creature Type:** Humanoid
- **Size:** Medium (typically 5-6 feet tall)
- **Speed:** 30 feet
- **Lifespan:** 75-85 years average; 100+ years rare but not unheard of

### Ability Score Increases
Per D&D 5e (2024) rules, ability scores are determined by Background rather than species.

### Languages
- **Automatic:** Common (the trade tongue that unifies the realm)
- **Additional Options:** Regional dialects vary by homeland

### Racial Traits

#### Resourceful
Humans begin each day with renewed determination. You gain **Heroic Inspiration** whenever you finish a Long Rest.

*In Eldermyr, this represents the human drive to seize each day—the knowledge that life is short makes every moment precious.*

#### Skillful
You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

*Human society's complexity requires diverse skills. Whether a [[Crossford]] merchant learning to spot counterfeit coins or a [[Stahlburg]] soldier training with blade and bow, humans adapt to their circumstances.*

#### Versatile
You gain an **Origin Feat** of your choice (in addition to the Origin Feat from your background).

*This represents humanity's remarkable adaptability—the same species that produces [[The Grey Wardens]]' monster hunters also produces [[The Arcane Academy]]'s scholars and [[Porto Valdris]]'s merchant princes.*

### Subraces/Lineages
Humans do not have mechanical subraces, but in Eldermyr, regional backgrounds significantly shape culture and outlook. See **Regional Varieties** below.

## Physical Characteristics

### Appearance

- **Skin Coloring:** Varies by region—olive and tan in [[The Western Shore]], fair in [[The Northlands]], weathered bronze in [[The Eastern March]], pale in [[The Karath Reach]]
- **Hair:** All natural colors from pale blonde to black; red hair is rare and sometimes considered lucky or unlucky depending on region
- **Eyes:** Brown, blue, green, gray, and hazel common; eye color carries no regional pattern
- **Distinctive Features:** Regional styles of facial hair, scarification, and body modification vary
- **Sexual Dimorphism:** Males average 4-6 inches taller; significant overlap in all physical traits

### Aging
- **Childhood and Maturation:** Children are considered adults at 16-18 depending on region and class; noble children may be betrothed younger
- **Adult Prime:** 20-50 years; most active period
- **Elder Characteristics:** Hair grays, joints stiffen, strength fades; those who survive past 60 are respected for wisdom

## Biology

### Physiology
- **Dietary Needs:** Omnivorous; require regular meals; can fast for days but suffer
- **Sleep Patterns:** Require 6-8 hours per night; sleep deprivation causes rapid deterioration
- **Environmental Tolerances:** Moderate; survive extreme cold or heat worse than adapted species
- **Reproduction:** Live birth after 9-month gestation; twins uncommon, larger multiples rare
- **Unique Abilities:** None innate; humans compensate through tools, training, and sheer determination

### Life Cycle
- **Birth:** Live birth; high infant mortality among lower classes
- **Childhood Duration:** 16-18 years to adulthood
- **Maturity Age:** 18 (legal), 25 (full physical)
- **Adult Lifespan:** 60-80 years typical
- **Maximum Age:** ~100 years; 120+ nearly unheard of without magical assistance

### Health & Medicine
- **Common Ailments:** Plague, fever, infections, childbirth complications; magical healing rare and expensive
- **Resistances:** None innate
- **Vulnerabilities:** No special vulnerabilities, but lack the natural resistances of dwarves or the disease resistance of elves
- **Dietary Requirements:** Balanced diet needed; malnutrition common among poor

## Psychology

### Mental Characteristics
- **Cognitive Tendencies:** Highly adaptable; quick learners but information fades faster than longer-lived species
- **Emotional Expression:** Highly variable; emotional expression varies by region and class
- **Common Personality Patterns:** Ambitious, tribal loyalty to family/house/region, short-term thinking
- **Learning Styles:** Diverse; humans excel at imitation and innovation equally

### Instincts
- Survival drives strong; fight-or-flight reliable
- Tribal instincts lead to in-group loyalty and out-group suspicion
- Reproduction drive and family protection fundamental

### Values
- **Family and Legacy:** Continuation of bloodline matters greatly, especially to nobility
- **Honor:** Defined differently by region—martial prowess in the March, mercantile success on the Shore, piety in the Crown Lands
- **Power:** Humans crave influence over their environment and others
- **Justice:** Defined by culture; often tribal rather than universal

### Stereotypes vs. Reality

**Stereotype:** Humans are greedy, short-sighted, and violent.
**Reality:** Human ambition builds as much as it destroys. The great roads, the unified realm, the cathedrals to [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]—all human achievements. The same drive that causes wars also drives progress.

**Stereotype:** Humans are bland compared to other species.
**Reality:** Human diversity exceeds any other species. A [[Vindrheim]] fur trader and a [[Porto Valdris]] silk merchant might as well be different species in culture, appearance, and values.

## Culture

### Society
- **Government Forms:** Feudal monarchy in decline; power distributed among great houses
- **Social Hierarchy:** Rigid class system—royalty, high nobility, lesser nobility, clergy, merchants, artisans, peasants, serfs
- **Family Structures:** Patrilineal inheritance dominant; nuclear families among commoners, extended family networks among nobility
- **Gender Roles:** Male-preference primogeniture; women can inherit in absence of male heirs; merchant and peasant women have more practical equality

### Values & Philosophy
- **The Crown Lands:** Order, tradition, proper hierarchy, piety
- **The Eastern March:** Martial honor, strength, endurance, loyalty to house
- **The Western Shore:** Prosperity, sophistication, cunning, family advancement
- **The Northlands:** Independence, old traditions, harmony with nature, ancestor reverence
- **The Karath Reach:** Survival, resentment, restoration of lost honor

### Religion & Spirituality
- **Common Faith:** [[The Faith of the Three]] dominates; Warden (order), Shepherd (mercy), Chronicler (death and memory)
- **Regional Variations:** The Warden's Hand (East), The Shepherd's Path (West), The Chronicler's Silence (North)
- **Heresies:** [[The Ash Penitents]] believe the risen dead are divine punishment
- **Old Ways:** Ancestor veneration survives in [[The Northlands]] and rural areas

### Art & Expression
- **Visual Arts:** Religious iconography, heraldry, portrait painting (nobility), folk art (commoners)
- **Music:** Hymns, courtly ballads, martial drums, folk songs
- **Literature:** Chronicles, poetry, theological texts; literacy rare among commoners
- **Performance:** Mystery plays, tournaments, public executions (as spectacle)

### Naming Conventions

#### Language & Phonetics
- **Language Name:** Common (trade tongue); regional languages exist but Common dominates
- **Real-World Inspiration:** English/French (Crown), Germanic (East), Romance (West), Norse (North), Slavic (South)
- **Phonetic Rules:** Vary by region; see Regional Varieties above

#### Name Structure
- **First/Birth Names:** Given at birth; often honor ancestors or saints
- **Family/Clan Names:** Inherited; noble houses trace lineages centuries
- **Earned Names/Epithets:** "The Mad King," "The Steward," "The Bold"—earned through deeds
- **Secret/True Names:** Not traditionally used by humans

## History

### Origins
Human origins are lost to time. The Faith teaches that [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]] created humanity to steward the material world. Older traditions in [[The Northlands]] speak of ancestors who walked from another land when the world was young. Whatever the truth, humans have dominated Eldermyr since before recorded history.

### Historical Eras

**Age of Clans (Ancient):**
Scattered tribes warred constantly. No unified human identity existed—only clan against clan. This era ended when a great unifier (or threat) forced cooperation.

**Age of Kings (~500 years):**
The founding of the unified realm. Human kings established [[Aldersgate]], built [[The King's Road]], and spread [[The Faith of the Three]]. This was humanity's golden age—prosperity, expansion, and relative peace.

**Age of Ashes (27 years–present):**
[[The Mad King]]'s reign, [[The Great War]], and the broken peace. Human civilization is fracturing. The great houses circle each other while something terrible stirs in [[The Ashen Fields]].

### Relationship with Other Species
- **Dwarves:** Respect and trade; the March humans and mountain dwarves have cooperated for centuries
- **Elves:** Wariness; humans and elves have different timescales and priorities
- **Halflings:** Friendly; seen as harmless neighbors in the Crown Lands
- **Orcs:** Suspicion; orcs are tolerated but not trusted
- **Others:** Varies; rarer species inspire curiosity or fear

### Diaspora
Humans originated somewhere in what is now [[The Crown Lands]] and spread to fill every region of Eldermyr. They did not migrate to the realm—they have always been here, or believe they have.

## Homeland

### Traditional Lands
Humans claim all of Eldermyr as their homeland. Unlike dwarves (mountains), elves (forests), or halflings (pastoral hills), humans have no single ecological niche. This adaptability allowed them to dominate but also means humans lack the deep connection to place that other species possess.

### Current Distribution
- **Majority Populations:** All major settlements are human-majority
- **Minority Communities:** Rural areas sometimes have significant non-human populations
- **Urban vs. Rural:** Cities are 90%+ human; villages may be 70-80%

## Society Details

### Government
- **Leadership Selection:** Hereditary monarchy (currently in crisis); male-preference primogeniture
- **Decision-making:** King rules with council of great lords; local lords have significant autonomy
- **Laws and Justice:** The King's Justice (royal law), Lord's Justice (local), and Church Justice (heresy, souls)

### Economy
- **Common Occupations:** Farming (vast majority), crafting, trade, soldiering, clergy
- **Trade Goods:** Grain, wool, wine, metals, textiles, weapons
- **Economic Philosophy:** Feudal obligation; wealth belongs to lords who protect it

### Military
- **Warrior Culture:** Varies by region—the March is highly martial; the Shore prefers mercenaries
- **Preferred Weapons:** Sword, spear, bow; knights use lance and longsword
- **Military Organization:** Feudal levy system; each lord raises troops from their lands

### Education
- **Knowledge Transmission:** Apprenticeship for trades; clergy train in monasteries; nobles have tutors
- **Formal Education:** [[The Arcane Academy]] for mages; cathedral schools for clergy; rare elsewhere
- **Valued Knowledge:** Practical skills for commoners; letters, arms, and governance for nobility

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Dwarves:** "Hasty, short-sighted, but capable of surprising greatness when they focus"
- **Elves:** "Mayflies burning bright before they fade—beautiful and tragic"
- **Halflings:** "The Big Folk mean well but make everything complicated"
- **Orcs:** "Weak individually, but there are so many of them"

### Perception of Others
- **Dwarves:** Respected craftsmen and reliable allies, if stubborn
- **Elves:** Beautiful and wise, but arrogant and slow to act
- **Halflings:** Good neighbors, simple folk, harmless
- **Orcs:** Dangerous savages who must be watched (prejudice common)
- **Tieflings:** Corrupted, cursed, not to be trusted (strong prejudice)
- **Aasimar:** Blessed, holy, touched by the Three (reverence)

### Integration
Humans are not the ones who integrate—other species integrate into human society. Human cultures absorb elements from others but maintain dominance. This is both humanity's strength (cultural flexibility) and weakness (inability to truly understand non-human perspectives).

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Ambition:** Seeking wealth, power, or fame
- **Duty:** Serving house, faith, or realm
- **Desperation:** Fleeing trouble, seeking survival
- **Curiosity:** Wanting to see the world
- **Justice:** Righting wrongs, hunting villains

### Common Classes
- **Fighter:** The most common; human soldiers, knights, and sellswords
- **Cleric:** Servants of [[The Faith of the Three]]
- **Rogue:** Spies, thieves, and scouts
- **Paladin:** Holy warriors of the Faith
- **Wizard:** Graduates of [[The Arcane Academy]]
- **Any Class:** Humans can excel at anything

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Adventurers are viewed with suspicion (rootless wanderers) or hope (heroes who solve problems)
- **Cultural Expectations:** Expected to eventually settle down and become productive members of society
- **Support from Community:** Variable; some communities welcome adventurers, others drive them out

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Consider your region's cultural values and how you embody or rebel against them
- Humans live fast—you have maybe 60 years of active life, so urgency is natural
- Think about your social class and how it shapes your worldview
- Family and legacy matter; even commoners want their children to do better

### Cultural Touchstones
- Regional accents and speech patterns
- Attitudes toward [[The Faith of the Three]]
- Views on the succession crisis (who should rule?)
- Relationship with your home community

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Not all humans are ambitious schemers—some just want to survive
- Regional identity can be as strong as national identity
- Class matters enormously; a noble and peasant from the same region may have less in common than nobles from different regions
- Humans can be as wise and patient as elves or as steadfast as dwarves—they just have less time to develop these qualities

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **[[House Thorne]] Second Son:** A knight who will never inherit, seeking glory in service to the realm—or in rebellion against the system that leaves him landless.

2. **[[Crossford]] Merchant's Daughter:** A trader who's seen the realm's diversity through commerce and understands that the coming war will destroy everything her family built.

3. **[[The Karath Reach]] Survivor:** A farmer whose family was destroyed in [[The Great War]], now seeing the dead rise in fields they once tilled—consumed by rage, grief, and terrible knowledge.

4. **[[Porto Valdris]] Spy:** A charming socialite who sells information to the highest bidder, finding that the coming conflict makes their skills valuable—and their position dangerous.

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a human knight from [[The Eastern March]], male, early thirties with the weathered look of someone who has spent years training in mountain winds and highland cold. Strong Germanic features—broad jaw, high cheekbones, a nose broken and healed slightly crooked; skin wind-burned and tanned with a scar crossing the left eyebrow, the kind of face that tells stories of border skirmishes and harsh winters. Steel-gray eyes holding the calculating gaze of someone who assesses threats by instinct, crow's feet from squinting against mountain glare. Dark brown hair cropped short in military fashion, touched with premature gray at the temples, a short beard maintained with soldier's practicality. Expression of guarded resolve and weary determination, the look of a man who has seen too much but continues his duty. Wearing a steel gorget over a gambeson of [[House Thorne]] colors—gray and crimson—the fabric worn but well-maintained, a cloak pin bearing the Thorne sigil of a briar-wrapped blade. A scar on the neck visible above the gorget, old enough to be pale. Background of blurred mountain peaks at dawn, suggesting [[Ostmark Pass]]. Lighting of cold morning sun catching the metal and bringing out the texture of weathered skin. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality. Fantasy medieval knight portrait.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
The great hall of [[Aldersgate]] during the regency crisis—a vast chamber of ancient stone, banners of all the great houses hanging from vaulted ceilings forty feet above. Six human nobles from different regions gathered around a table strewn with maps, each wearing the distinct fashion of their homeland: a [[House Valdren]] lord in Western Shore silks of deep blue and silver, rings on every finger, dark hair oiled and styled; a [[House Thorne]] commander in practical Eastern March gray wool and leather, scarred hands flat on the table; a Crown Lands bishop in the white and gold of [[The Faith of the Three]], tonsured head bowed in thought; a [[Northlands]] trader in furs and roughspun, red beard braided with iron rings; a [[The Karath Reach|Karath]] minor lord in faded black, face gaunt and eyes hollow with old grief. At the head of the table, the empty throne where [[High King Aldric II|the Steward King]] once sat. Tension visible in postures—the Thorne leaning forward aggressively, the Valdren lounging with false ease, the Karath watching everyone with calculating stillness. Guards in various house livery standing at the walls. Through tall windows, the spires of the capital visible against a gray sky. Braziers providing warm light that catches the gold thread in noble garments and the steel of half-hidden weapons. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting, rich textures, intricate detail on clothing and cultural elements, dramatic atmosphere suggesting political tension, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality. Fantasy medieval political council scene.

## Notes

Humans are the lens through which Eldermyr is viewed—the realm was built by humans, is ruled by humans, and will be saved or destroyed by human choices. When building a human character, consider how the current crisis affects them personally. Every human in Eldermyr has an opinion about who should wear [[The Iron Crown]], even if that opinion is "anyone who will leave me alone."

The succession crisis is fundamentally about human ambition, human grief, and human failure. [[The Mad King]] was human. [[Prince Edric the Liberator]] was human. [[The Unnamed]] was awakened by human hubris. Whatever hope exists also rests on human shoulders.
