# Orcs

> *"They call us savages from beyond the mountains. They forget that we've held the line at Ostmark for three generations now—Thorne coin, orc blood. When the eastern horrors come howling down the pass, it's not their knights who meet them first. It's us. And when this succession nonsense boils over into war, they'll remember they need us. They always do."*
> — Warchief Grokmar Ironjaw, commander of the Ostmark Mercenary Company

## Overview

The orcs of Eldermyr occupy a complicated position—feared for their reputation, needed for their strength, and grudgingly tolerated in a realm that has never fully accepted them. Comprising roughly 1% of the population, they are concentrated in [[The Eastern March]], where three generations ago [[House Thorne]] made a controversial bargain: orc warriors would defend [[Ostmark Pass]] against the threats beyond in exchange for land, pay, and a chance at legitimacy. Today, orc mercenary companies serve Thorne interests, orc laborers work the mountain mines, and orc families have settled in communities around [[Stahlburg]]. They remain outsiders—distrusted by humans who remember old wars and orc raids—but they have proven their value in blood. The current succession crisis may determine whether orcs rise to acceptance or are cast out again.

## Species Traits

### Core Traits
- **Creature Type:** Humanoid
- **Size:** Medium (6-7 feet tall)
- **Speed:** 30 feet
- **Lifespan:** ~80 years; few reach old age naturally

### Ability Score Increases
Per D&D 5e (2024) rules, ability scores are determined by Background rather than species.

### Languages
- **Automatic:** Common, Orc
- **Additional Options:** Dwarvish (from march work), Giant (from mountain contacts)

### Racial Traits

#### Adrenaline Rush
You can take the **Dash** action as a **Bonus Action**. When you do so, you gain **Temporary Hit Points** equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all uses on a Short or Long Rest.

*Orc physiology produces powerful combat hormones that fuel explosive bursts of speed and aggression. What humans call "berserker rage," orcs call "getting started."*

#### Darkvision (120 ft.)
You can see in dim light within 120 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

*Orc eyes are adapted for twilight ambushes and night raids. In the darkness, orcs see what their enemies cannot.*

#### Relentless Endurance
When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

*Orcs simply do not die easily. Wounds that would kill a human merely enrage an orc. This trait has earned them a reputation for surviving impossible battles.*

### Subraces/Lineages

While D&D 5e (2024) doesn't include orc subraces, Eldermyr recognizes cultural distinctions:

#### Settled Orcs (Realm-Born)
Those born in Eldermyr to integrated families. More familiar with human customs, often speak Common fluently, may have human friends or allies.

#### Clan Orcs (Beyond-Born)
Those who still identify with the traditional clans beyond [[Ostmark Pass]]. Maintain old customs, may be first-generation immigrants or visitors.

## Physical Characteristics

### Appearance

- **Eye Characteristics:** Small, deep-set eyes often with red, amber, or yellow coloring; excellent night vision
- **Distinctive Features:** Prominent lower tusks (ranging from subtle to dramatic); heavy brows; flat noses
- **Sexual Dimorphism:** Males average slightly taller; both genders are powerfully built

### Aging
- **Childhood and Maturation:** Orc children mature rapidly; considered adult at 14-16
- **Adult Prime:** 14-50 years; orcs spend most of their lives in their physical prime
- **Elder Characteristics:** Orcs rarely live long enough to show age; those who do gray early and carry many scars
- **Signs of Aging:** Slowing reflexes, accumulated injuries, graying hair; rare to see

### Variations
- **Clan Differences:** Beyond-born orcs may have clan scarification, tattoos, or tusk modifications
- **Settled Orcs:** May dress in human styles, trim or file tusks, adopt local customs
- **Mixed Heritage:** Half-orcs exist; may choose orc or human traits mechanically

## Biology

### Physiology
- **Dietary Needs:** High protein requirements; prefer meat; can survive on minimal food but become aggressive
- **Sleep Patterns:** 5-6 hours; light sleepers; can function on less for extended periods
- **Environmental Tolerances:** Hardy in cold; handle physical hardship well; fewer tolerances for refined environments
- **Reproduction:** Higher fertility than humans; shorter generations; population can recover quickly from losses
- **Unique Abilities:** Adrenaline response for burst speed; remarkable ability to survive lethal wounds

### Life Cycle

- **Resistances:** Pain tolerance remarkable; survive wounds that would kill others
- **Healing Differences:** Heal quickly but crudely; scarring common
- **Dietary Requirements:** High protein; nutritional deficiency causes aggression and cognitive decline

## Psychology

### Mental Characteristics
- **Cognitive Tendencies:** Direct, practical thinking; tactical intelligence often underestimated; strong spatial reasoning
- **Emotional Expression:** Intense and open; orcs feel strongly and show it; anger, joy, and grief all expressed powerfully
- **Common Personality Patterns:** Direct, loyal to tribe/family, aggressive when threatened, surprisingly sentimental about kin

### Instincts
- **Pack Loyalty:** Powerful bonds to chosen group (clan, company, family)
- **Territorial Defense:** Strong drive to protect claimed space
- **Dominance Recognition:** Instinctive understanding of social hierarchy; respect earned, not given

### Values

- **Loyalty (Throgg):** Betrayal is the worst sin; stand by your own
- **Honor (Zharz):** Keep your word; fight fairly; earn your place
- **Endurance (Kragh):** Suffering builds character; pain is temporary

### Stereotypes vs. Reality

**Stereotype:** Orcs are mindless brutes who live for violence.
**Reality:** Orcs are pragmatic survivors whose violent reputation comes from being marginalized and desperate. Given opportunity, they build communities and raise families like anyone else.

**Stereotype:** Orcs can't be trusted; they'll always betray you.
**Reality:** Orc loyalty is fierce—to their own group. The problem is humans rarely become part of that group. Those who do find orcs to be the most reliable allies possible.

**Stereotype:** Orcs are stupid.
**Reality:** Orc intelligence manifests differently than human intelligence. They excel at tactics, spatial reasoning, and practical problem-solving. They're uninterested in, not incapable of, academic learning.

## Culture

### Society
- **Government Forms:** Clan structures led by proven warriors; democratic in the sense that poor leaders are replaced (sometimes violently)
- **Social Hierarchy:** Merit-based; age and experience respected but challenged; those who can't contribute become burdens
- **Family Structures:** Extended clan networks; children raised communally; adoption common
- **Gender Roles:** Combat roles traditionally male; household leadership traditionally female; both fight when needed

### Values & Philosophy

**The Settled Orcs:**
- Earning a place in the realm through service
- Proving worth to skeptical humans
- Building something for the next generation
- Balance between old traditions and new necessities

**The Clan Orcs:**
- Strength through unity
- Honor in combat
- Survival of the clan above all
- Wariness of civilization's softness

### Religion & Spirituality
**Gruumsh One-Eye:** Traditional orc deity, god of conquest and survival. Some orcs still honor him; others have abandoned the old ways.

**Ancestor Spirits:** Common belief that strong ancestors watch over descendants. Honorable deaths join them; shameful deaths are forgotten.

**The Faith of the Three:** Some settled orcs have adopted the human religion, particularly the Warden's aspects of justice and order. The Church is uncertain how to respond.

### Art & Expression
- **Visual Arts:** Scarification, tattoos, weapon decoration, war paint; functional objects made beautiful
- **Music:** War drums, chanting, throat-singing; powerful rhythms; battle-songs
- **Literature:** Oral traditions; clan histories; epic poems of great deeds
- **Performance:** Ritual combat displays, victory dances, funeral rites

### Naming Conventions

#### Language & Phonetics
- **Language Name:** Orcish
- **Real-World Inspiration:** Guttural sounds, hard consonants
- **Phonetic Rules:** Hard consonants (k, g, r, z); minimal soft sounds; clan prefixes

#### Name Structure

## History

### Origins
Orcs originated beyond the mountains, in harsh lands where survival demanded strength. They have always been there, always fighting—each other when no one else was available, others when opportunity arose.

### Historical Eras

**The Time of Raids (Ancient):**
For centuries, orcs were simply raiders from beyond the mountains. They came through [[Ostmark Pass]], took what they could, and retreated. Humans and dwarves fought them, hated them, and sometimes traded with them.

**The Thorne Compact (Three Generations Ago):**
[[House Thorne]], facing threats both human and otherworldly, made a pragmatic choice. They offered orc clans a bargain: defend the pass and serve Thorne interests in exchange for land, pay, and limited acceptance. Many orcs accepted.

**The Great War (27-23 Years Ago):**
Orc mercenaries fought for [[House Thorne]] during the rebellion. They proved their value—and their loyalty. When the Thornes switched sides, the orcs switched with them. This earned grudging respect from some humans and bitter hatred from others (particularly [[House Karath]], who remember orc companies burning their villages).

**The Present:**
Three generations of settlement have created a new orc identity—neither fully integrated nor completely separate. The succession crisis threatens this precarious position. If [[House Thorne]] falls, what happens to the orcs they sheltered?

### Relationship with Other Species
- **Humans:** Complicated; employers, enemies, sometimes neighbors; mutual suspicion remains
- **Dwarves:** Ancient enmity but pragmatic cooperation in the March; dwarves respect orc strength
- **Elves:** Mutual ancient hatred; elves remember wrongs orcs have forgotten; little modern contact
- **Halflings:** Terror; halflings hide from orcs; orcs barely notice halflings
- **Gnomes:** Wariness; gnomes are too clever to fight fairly; orcs respect this
- **Goliaths:** Respect; shared mountain origins; competition rather than conflict

### Diaspora
- **Main Population:** Beyond [[Ostmark Pass]] (the orc homelands, population unknown)
- **Settled Communities:** [[The Eastern March]], particularly around [[Stahlburg]] and the pass
- **Scattered Individuals:** Mercenaries, laborers, and exiles throughout the realm

## Homeland

### Traditional Lands
Orc homelands lie beyond [[Ostmark Pass]], in mountain valleys and harsh steppes where clan wars have raged for millennia. Few humans have seen these lands and returned.

**The Settled Lands:**
Orc communities in Eldermyr center on [[The Eastern March]]:
- **Ironhold:** Orc settlement near [[Stahlburg]]; roughly 2,000 orcs
- **The Pass Camps:** Military encampments at [[Ostmark Pass]]; rotating garrison
- **Scattered Holdings:** Small orc families throughout Thorne territory

### Current Distribution
- **Beyond the Pass:** Tens of thousands (unknown exact number)
- **The Eastern March:** ~5,000 settled orcs
- **Elsewhere in Eldermyr:** Perhaps 1,000; mercenaries, exiles, individuals

## Society Details

### Government
- **Leadership Selection:** Chieftains prove themselves through combat, wisdom, and success; followers choose to follow
- **Decision-making:** Council of clan elders; chief has final authority but wise chiefs consult
- **Laws and Justice:** Customary law; blood-price for wrongs; trial by combat for disputes

### Economy
- **Common Occupations:** Soldier, guard, laborer, hunter, smith (weapons)
- **Trade Goods:** Military service, raw materials, furs, basic crafts
- **Economic Philosophy:** Take what you're strong enough to hold; trading is for those who can't take

### Military
- **Warrior Culture:** Central to orc identity; all orcs learn to fight; warriors respected above all
- **Preferred Weapons:** Greataxe, greatsword, javelin; heavy weapons that use orc strength
- **Military Organization:** Clan warbands; mercenary companies; informal but effective command

### Education
- **Knowledge Transmission:** Oral tradition; learning by doing; elders teach youth
- **Formal Education:** None; settled orcs may attend human schools (rare and awkward)
- **Valued Knowledge:** Combat, survival, clan history, tactics

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Humans:** "Dangerous but useful; pay them well and point them at your enemies; never turn your back"
- **Dwarves:** "Strong warriors, crude smiths; better as neighbors than enemies; old grudges heal slowly"
- **Elves:** "Beasts who crawl from the mountains; our ancestors died to their raids; we do not forget"
- **Halflings:** "Hide. Hide now. Don't come out until they're gone."

### Perception of Others
- **Humans:** Useful employers; untrustworthy allies; individually variable; collectively scheming
- **Dwarves:** Worthy opponents; grudgingly respected; better to fight alongside than against
- **Elves:** Ancient enemies; arrogant; dangerous but rarely encountered
- **Halflings:** Beneath notice; occasionally good for supplies; no sport in hunting them
- **Gnomes:** Clever prey; not worth the trouble
- **Goliaths:** Kin of a sort; respect their strength; good rivals

### Integration
Settled orcs maintain distinct communities within [[The Eastern March]] but interact with humans daily. Full integration is rare—mixed marriages happen but face discrimination. Most orcs occupy a middle ground: present but separate.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Prove Worth:** Demonstrate value to skeptical humans
- **Earn Gold:** Mercenary work is traditional and respected
- **Exile:** Punishment or escape from clan conflicts
- **Glory:** Great deeds earn songs and remembrance
- **Survival:** The clan needs resources, allies, or solutions

### Common Classes
- **Barbarian:** Natural fit; rage and orc adrenaline combine powerfully
- **Fighter:** Disciplined warrior; mercenary tradition
- **Ranger:** Hunter and scout; wilderness survival
- **Paladin:** Oath-bound warrior; some orcs find purpose in divine service
- **Warlock:** Those who seek power through any means

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Adventurers who succeed earn respect; those who fail are forgotten
- **Cultural Expectations:** Bring back gold, glory, or useful connections; don't embarrass the clan
- **Support from Community:** Clan helps equip warriors; expects tribute from success

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Direct communication; say what you mean
- Loyalty to your group is paramount
- Respect earned through deeds, not words
- Violence is a tool, not a personality
- Proving yourself never stops

### Cultural Touchstones
- Physical displays of capability
- Scarification and trophies marking achievements
- Strong bonds with chosen companions
- Distrust of human promises; respect for kept oaths

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Orcs can be clever, subtle, and patient
- Not all orcs are aggressive; some prefer peace but aren't weak
- Orc culture has depth—art, music, philosophy
- Individual orcs vary as much as individual humans

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **Ostmark Company Veteran:** Three generations of your family have held the pass. You've earned your place—but the succession crisis threatens everything. You need to ensure [[House Thorne]] survives, or find a new patron.

2. **Clan Exile Seeking Redemption:** You broke clan law and were cast out. Now you wander human lands, seeking enough glory or gold to return—or perhaps finding you no longer want to.

3. **Second-Generation Settler:** Born in Eldermyr, you've never seen the homelands. You're more comfortable in [[Stahlburg]] than the wilderness. Human friends, orc family, caught between worlds.

4. **[[The Grey Wardens]] Recruit:** The rising dead don't care about species prejudice. You were recruited for your strength and night vision. Now you fight alongside humans and dwarves against something worse than any of you.

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of an orc mercenary veteran, male, approximately forty years old—ancient by orc standards, having survived what most don't. Broad, powerful features with grayish-green skin weathered by decades of mountain campaigns, a network of old scars telling stories of battles survived including a dramatic one crossing the left brow down to the cheek. Deep-set amber eyes beneath heavy brows, carrying the calculating assessment of a seasoned warrior who has learned that surviving matters more than winning. Prominent lower tusks jutting past the upper lip, one slightly chipped—damage worn with pride rather than repaired. Black hair shot with gray pulled back in a warrior's topknot, the sides of the head showing ritual scarification of clan marks and earned achievements. Heavy jaw set in an expression of guarded evaluation, neither hostile nor friendly—the look of someone deciding if you're threat, opportunity, or neither. Wearing practical mercenary gear: a steel gorget over mail visible at the collar, a worn leather shoulder pauldron bearing the insignia of the Ostmark Mercenary Company, a wolf-fur cloak pushed back, all well-maintained but showing years of hard use. Behind one ear, a small braid holding tokens—a dwarven coin, a human medal, markers of contracts honored. Background of mountain pass at dusk, suggesting [[Ostmark Pass]], the fading light catching the steel and emphasizing the weariness and watchfulness. Dramatic side-lighting suggesting campfire, warm oranges against cool mountain blues.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
An orc encampment at [[Ostmark Pass]] as night falls—the forward defensive position where orc mercenaries hold the line between Eldermyr and the unknown threats beyond. A dozen orcs of varying ages around a central fire, their war-camp a mixture of practical fortification and rough comfort. Tents of treated hide and scavenged canvas against the mountain cold; weapon racks holding axes and swords being maintained by their owners; a spit of roasting mountain goat tended by a scarred cook. The orcs themselves: a massive clan chief in iron-studded leather addressing the group, his tusked silhouette dramatic against the firelight; younger warriors in various states of relaxation cleaning weapons, playing a game with carved bones, arm-wrestling; an elderly female shaman reading omens in the fire's smoke, her eyes reflecting ancient knowledge; a pair of sentries at the edge of the light, looking outward toward the dark pass. The fortifications visible: sharpened stakes, a stone wall begun and never finished, signal fires ready to be lit. Behind them, the massive bulk of [[The Ostmark Range]] rising into the night sky. In the distance through the pass, an uncertain darkness that suggests why this position matters. The atmosphere of warriors at rest but never relaxed, of a people who have found a place in a world that distrusts them, of strength earning what diplomacy could not. Lighting from the central fire and scattered torches—warm orange playing over green-gray skin and glinting on weapons, cold blue mountain darkness surrounding.

## Notes

The orcs' position in Eldermyr reflects one of the world's key themes: who belongs, and who decides? [[House Thorne]] made orcs useful, but usefulness isn't acceptance. If the succession crisis ends with Thorne diminished or destroyed, orc communities face an uncertain future.

Orc warriors serving [[The Grey Wardens]] at [[The Ashen Fields]] present an interesting dynamic. The rising dead don't care about species prejudice—an orc blade kills them as well as a human one. This crisis might force integration that peace could never achieve. Or it might not.

The orcs remember [[House Karath]]—they burned Karath villages during [[The Great War]]. [[Lord Draven Karath]] remembers too. If Karath rises, orc communities become targets. The orcs know this. They're already preparing contingencies.
