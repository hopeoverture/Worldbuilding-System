# Tieflings

> *"They call us demon-spawn, devil-touched, sin made flesh. They see the horns, the tail, the eyes that glow in darkness, and they make assumptions. They don't ask how we came to be, what our ancestors sacrificed, what we've done to earn our damnation. They just see the mark. So be it. If they're going to hate me for how I look, I might as well give them something real to fear."*
> — Mordai the Branded, mercenary captain of the Crimson Horns

## Overview

Tieflings carry the visible mark of fiendish ancestry—horns, tails, unusual skin, and infernal power. In Eldermyr, they are perhaps 2% of the population, scattered and hiding throughout the realm. Unlike aasimar, whose celestial heritage is celebrated, tieflings face persecution, discrimination, and—particularly since the heresy trials resumed in [[Thornhall]]—active danger. Most tiefling bloodlines trace back to pacts made during the Age of Clans, when desperate humans bargained with dark powers for survival. Others emerged during [[The Mad King]]'s reign, when forbidden rituals twisted bloodlines. Whatever the source, tieflings bear the visible proof of ancestral sin, and Eldermyr's current atmosphere of fear and suspicion makes their existence increasingly precarious.

#### Otherworldly Presence
You know the **Thaumaturgy** cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability.

*The fiendish presence within can manifest in minor supernatural effects—eyes that flash, voice that echoes, flames that flicker.*

### Subraces/Lineages

The three Fiendish Legacies reflect different sources of tiefling blood:

- **Abyssal:** Descended from deals with demons; chaotic, corruptive
- **Chthonic:** Descended from pacts with underworld powers; connected to death
- **Infernal:** Descended from deals with devils; structured, contractual

## Physical Characteristics

- **Generational Changes:** Tiefling traits can strengthen or weaken across generations

## Biology

### Physiology
- **Dietary Needs:** Human-equivalent

## Psychology

### Mental Characteristics
- **Cognitive Tendencies:** Human-range; no inherent evil despite stereotypes
- **Emotional Expression:** Often guarded due to persecution; strong emotions when expressed
- **Common Personality Patterns:** Wary, self-reliant, cynical, defensive; also resilient, adaptable, loyal to those who prove trustworthy
- **Learning Styles:** Human-range; may have affinity for infernal languages and magic

### Instincts
- **Self-Preservation:** Strong survival instincts born of persecution
- **Suspicion:** Learned wariness of authority and strangers
- **Defiance:** Many develop rebellious tendencies in response to rejection

### Values
Values vary as much as humans'. Tieflings are not inherently evil—they are humans with fiendish heritage, shaped by their experiences.

- **Survival:** Often paramount given the dangers they face
- **Loyalty:** Those who earn a tiefling's trust rarely lose it
- **Independence:** Self-reliance is often necessary
- **Defiance or Adaptation:** Responses to discrimination vary

### Stereotypes vs. Reality

**Stereotype:** Tieflings are evil because of their fiendish blood.
**Reality:** Tieflings are individuals whose ancestors made pacts. They are no more inherently evil than humans—but facing constant hatred can push anyone toward bitterness.

**Stereotype:** Tieflings serve demons/devils.
**Reality:** The vast majority have no contact with fiends. They bear the mark of ancestral choices, not current allegiances.

**Stereotype:** Tieflings cannot be trusted.
**Reality:** Tieflings who find acceptance often become the most loyal allies. They know what betrayal costs.

## Culture

### Society
Tieflings have no unified culture—they are scattered individuals and small communities, shaped by hiding and survival.

**Hidden Communities:**
Some tieflings form secret enclaves in cities or wilderness, places where they can live without concealing their nature. [[Port Corsair]]'s rough reputation provides one such haven.

**Passing:**
Many tieflings attempt to conceal their heritage—hiding horns under hoods, binding tails, claiming scars or burns explain unusual skin.

**Open Survival:**
A few tieflings live openly, relying on strength, usefulness, or patrons to protect them.

### Regional Attitudes

**[[The Crown Lands]]:**
Worst discrimination. The Church's influence makes tieflings actively hunted during heresy trials. Most hide or flee.

**[[The Eastern March]]:**
[[House Thorne]]'s pragmatism extends to tieflings—if you can fight, your blood matters less. Some tiefling mercenaries serve here.

**[[The Western Shore]]:**
Cosmopolitan attitudes provide some tolerance. Wealthy tieflings may buy protection. [[Port Corsair]] is the safest place.

**[[The Northlands]]:**
The Old Ways care less about divine/infernal distinctions. Tieflings find more acceptance among the forest folk.

**[[The Karath Reach]]:**
Complicated. [[House Karath]] itself may have tiefling blood (rumors persist). Desperate people care less about bloodlines.

### Religion & Spirituality
Tieflings have complex relationships with faith:

- **The Faith of the Three:** Officially considers tieflings sin-marked; some priests offer redemption; others call for purging
- **The Old Ways:** More accepting; judges individuals rather than bloodlines
- **Fiendish Powers:** Some tieflings embrace their heritage; most avoid any association
- **Personal Faith:** Many develop individual spiritual practices outside formal religions

### Naming Conventions
Tieflings often adopt names that reflect their circumstances:

**Infernal Names:** Some embrace their heritage: Mordai, Nemeia, Azrael
**Virtue Names:** Claiming what they're denied: Hope, Grace, Justice
**Human Names:** Attempting to fit in: Common names from their region
**Abandoned Names:** Going by epithets or nicknames only

## History

### Origins
Tiefling bloodlines in Eldermyr have multiple sources:

**The Pact Families:** During the Age of Clans, when survival was uncertain, some desperate humans made deals with fiendish powers. Their descendants still bear the mark, even centuries later.

**The Mad King's Legacy:** [[The Mad King]]'s forbidden rituals twisted more than just the battlefield. Some exposed to his dark magic found their children born with horns and tails. These tieflings are only two-three generations old.

**Individual Bargains:** Throughout history, individuals have made personal pacts. Their children may be the first tieflings in their lines.

### The Current Crisis
The heresy trials that have resumed in [[Thornhall]] specifically target necromancy and dark magic. Tieflings—regardless of personal choices—are visibly marked by infernal power. They are being swept up in the paranoia, accused of serving [[The Unnamed]] or practicing forbidden arts simply because of how they look.

**Fleeing or Fighting:**
Tieflings face hard choices. Some flee to more tolerant regions or across the sea. Others hide deeper. A few have joined [[The Grey Wardens]], hoping to prove their loyalty through fighting the actual darkness. And some, pushed too far, have begun to consider whether their persecutors deserve the protection they're denied.

## Homeland

Tieflings have no homeland—they are scattered wherever they can survive.

**[[Port Corsair]]:** The closest thing to a tiefling safe haven. The port's rough reputation keeps Church influence limited.

**Hidden Enclaves:** Secret communities in wilderness areas, abandoned places, or protected districts.

### Current Distribution
- **[[Port Corsair]]:** Perhaps 200 tieflings, the largest concentration
- **[[The Western Shore]]:** Another 200 scattered
- **[[The Eastern March]]:** Perhaps 100, mostly mercenaries
- **Elsewhere:** Maybe 300 more, hidden and scattered
- **Total:** Roughly 800-1,000 tieflings in Eldermyr

## Society Details

### Survival Strategies
Tieflings have developed various approaches:

- **Concealment:** Hiding fiendish features; claiming human identity
- **Usefulness:** Providing skills too valuable to persecute
- **Patronage:** Finding powerful protectors
- **Isolation:** Living apart from society
- **Defiance:** Embracing the outcast identity

### Community Structures
- **Loose Networks:** Tieflings often know of each other and help when possible
- **Safe Houses:** Hidden locations where tieflings can shelter
- **Mixed Groups:** Often found in other marginalized communities (thieves' guilds, mercenary bands)

## Relations with Others

### Perception by Others
- **Common Folk:** Fear and suspicion; fiendish appearance means fiendish nature
- **The Church:** Sin made visible; must be contained, converted, or destroyed
- **Nobles:** Variable; some see dangerous servants, others see useful tools
- **Other Marginalized Groups:** Sympathy; shared experience of persecution

### Perception of Others
Most tieflings are intensely cautious:
- **Authority Figures:** Dangerous until proven otherwise
- **The Faithful:** Often enemies; sometimes surprisingly kind individuals
- **Fellow Outcasts:** Potential allies; understand the struggle
- **Those Who Prove Trustworthy:** Worth everything; loyalty repaid with loyalty

### Special Relationships

**Aasimar:** The inverse. Some tieflings feel kinship with those also marked by heritage. Some feel bitter resentment at the difference in treatment.

**[[House Karath]]:** Rumors persist that Karath bloodlines were touched during [[The Mad King]]'s reign. [[Yelena Karath]]'s pale, almost luminescent eyes fuel these whispers. If true, it might explain Karath willingness to deal with dark powers.

## Adventurers

### Why They Adventure
- **Escape:** Fleeing persecution; adventuring provides mobility
- **Proving Worth:** Demonstrating value through heroic deeds
- **Survival:** The skills pay well and keep you alive
- **Revenge:** Some have scores to settle with their persecutors
- **Seeking Answers:** Why this bloodline? What do the fiends want?

### Common Classes
- **Warlock:** Natural fit; may embrace or resist the fiendish connection
- **Rogue:** Survival skills; living in shadows
- **Sorcerer:** Innate magic; fiendish blood as power source
- **Paladin:** Redemption archetype; proving worth through oath
- **Fighter:** Mercenary tradition; proving value through combat

### Adventuring Culture
- **Status:** Adventurers are less bound by social rules; a tiefling adventurer faces less discrimination
- **Expectations:** Don't confirm the stereotypes; prove the doubters wrong
- **Support:** Other tieflings help where possible; no formal structure

## Roleplaying Guide

### Personality Considerations
- Constant awareness of how others perceive you
- Experience with prejudice shapes worldview
- Trust is earned slowly, but valuable when given
- Choosing between hiding and defiance
- The question of heritage: embrace, reject, or accept?

### Cultural Touchstones
- Knowledge of safe places and escape routes
- Awareness of Church activities and heresy trial locations
- Expertise in concealment and misdirection
- Solidarity with fellow outcasts

### Avoiding Stereotypes
- Not all tieflings are brooding or bitter
- Tieflings can be heroic, kind, optimistic
- Evil tieflings exist, but so do evil humans
- The heritage is not the person

### Sample Character Concepts

1. **[[The Grey Wardens]] Volunteer:** You joined to prove your worth. Fighting the risen dead shows everyone that fiendish blood doesn't mean serving darkness. But some of your visions at [[The Ashen Fields]] are disturbing...

2. **[[Port Corsair]] Survivor:** You grew up in the one place that accepted you. Now the crisis spreading across the realm threatens even that haven. You have skills—sailing, fighting, knowing the underworld. Time to use them.

3. **Hidden in Plain Sight:** You've passed as human for years—careful tailoring, creative explanations, constant vigilance. Now the heresy trials are getting closer, and someone who knows your secret has started asking questions.

4. **Karath Connection:** You have ties to [[The Karath Reach]]—possibly even to the family itself. The rumors about [[House Karath]] and tiefling blood might explain your own existence. But are you investigating them, or are they interested in you?

### Portrait (Bust)

**Prompt:**
Portrait bust of a tiefling rogue, female, late twenties—hardened by a life of survival on society's margins. Infernal features that she has learned to make striking rather than monstrous: skin of deep burgundy-red with darker variations at the cheekbones and temples, smooth as human skin but carrying a subtle texture like fine leather. Ram-like horns curving backward from her forehead, dark as obsidian and polished smooth—she maintains them carefully, refusing to be ashamed. Eyes of solid burnished gold without iris or pupil, catching light like coins, holding the calculating assessment of someone who has learned to read threats in every face. Sharp, angular features that might be beautiful on a human, rendered simultaneously striking and alien by the coloring and the small pointed teeth visible when she smiles. Dark hair—almost black—worn short and practical, revealing the full curve of her horns. Expression of wary amusement and defensive challenge, the look of someone who expects trouble and has learned to meet it head-on. A thin scar across one cheekbone—proof that she can be hurt, that she has been hurt, that she survived. Wearing the practical dark leather of someone who lives in shadows: a vest over a dark shirt, a hood pushed back, the glint of small weapons concealed about her person. A thin tail visible curving behind one shoulder—she doesn't hide it anymore. Background suggesting a dockside tavern, somewhere rough and tolerant—[[Port Corsair]] perhaps. Warm lamplight mixing with shadow, emphasizing both the exotic beauty and the dangerous edge.

### Cultural Scene

**Prompt:**
A hidden tiefling sanctuary somewhere in the back streets of [[Port Corsair]]—a basement room accessible only through a series of secret passages, where those marked by fiendish blood can gather without fear. A diverse group of eight tieflings in various states of concealment: some still wearing the hoods and wrappings that hide their nature in public, others revealed—horns of different shapes, skin of red and purple and ashen gray, tails wrapped around chair legs or gesturing as they talk. The space itself is humble but carefully maintained: mismatched furniture gathered over years, tapestries covering stone walls both for warmth and to muffle sound, candles and oil lamps providing warm light that catches on unusual eyes. A makeshift shrine in one corner—not to the Three who condemn them, but to something older, or perhaps simply to their own survival. One tiefling—older, scarred, respected—addresses the group from a central position, sharing news of the heresy trials in [[Thornhall]], warning of dangers, offering what help the community can provide. Faces show the range of tiefling responses: fear, anger, defiance, resignation, determination. A young tiefling barely past childhood sits near the back, experiencing community for the first time, eyes wide with wonder at seeing others like herself. On a table, practical supplies: forged documents, maps marking safe routes, coin for those who must flee, healing supplies for those who arrive hurt. The atmosphere of a community forged by persecution, of people who have only each other, of survival and solidarity in the face of a world that wishes they didn't exist. Lighting warm and protective, the shadows kept at bay, a pocket of safety in a dangerous world.

## Notes

Tieflings represent Eldermyr's capacity for cruelty toward its own people. They are not servants of [[The Unnamed]]—they are victims of a society that would rather persecute the visibly different than address the actual darkness spreading from [[The Ashen Fields]].

The cruel irony: tiefling resistance to necrotic damage (Chthonic) or fire (Infernal) and their willingness to fight might make them valuable allies against the risen dead. But the same Church that should be organizing the defense is too busy hunting people for how they look.

Some tieflings have begun to ask uncomfortable questions. If society treats them as monsters regardless of their choices, why continue choosing to be good? The answer—for those who remain heroes—is that they refuse to let their persecutors define them. But not everyone can maintain that resolve indefinitely.

The rumored tiefling blood in [[House Karath]] adds another dimension. If [[Lord Draven Karath]] or [[Yelena Karath]] carry fiendish heritage, it might explain their willingness to deal with [[The Unnamed]]. Or it might mean nothing—plenty of tieflings resist the darkness. Either way, the rumors make the Karath connection valuable or dangerous depending on circumstances.
