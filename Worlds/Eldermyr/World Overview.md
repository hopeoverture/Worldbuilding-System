# Eldermyr

> *"[[The Great War]] ended a generation ago, but peace has not healed Eldermyr. The victorious houses have grown arrogant; the defeated nurse their hatred in silence. And in [[The Karath Reach|the scarred lands]] where the worst battles raged, something is growing in the mass graves that no one has dared to visit."*

## Premise

Twenty-three years ago, the realm tore itself apart. High King Valdus I—[[The Mad King]]—was slain by his own son in a war that left fields of corpses and a kingdom of orphans. His younger son, [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]], spent two decades holding the broken pieces together through compromise, marriage alliances, and carefully measured justice.

Three months ago, [[High King Aldric II|the Steward King]] died in his sleep. Some say his heart gave out. Half the realm whispers poison.

Now the great houses circle each other like wolves. The victors have grown fat and cruel; the defeated have never stopped sharpening their knives. A boy of fifteen holds the strongest claim to the throne, but power respects nothing so fragile as blood. And in [[The Karath Reach|the scarred lands]] where the war's worst battles raged, the dead are beginning to stir—still fighting, still bleeding, still loyal to causes that should have died with them.

**The Bloodline:** [[High King Aldric II]] had one daughter, Princess Elara, who married [[Lord Varic Valdren]]'s son, Lord Cassian Valdren (now deceased—officially a riding accident; privately, half the court suspects murder). She died in childbirth; her son [[Edric Valdren]] carries the royal blood. Aldric II never remarried, making his grandson the strongest legitimate claimant—but a fifteen-year-old boy controlled by his Valdren grandfather is not universally accepted as the realm's future. [[House Thorne]] argues blood alone doesn't make a king; [[House Karath]] whispers that the Karath line (descended from [[The Mad King]]'s loyalist cousins) has claims too. The young heir shares his name with [[Prince Edric the Liberator]], the hero who killed his father and died in the act—a name that carries weight, expectation, and perhaps a curse.

Eldermyr follows male-preference primogeniture with cognatic fallback: sons inherit before daughters, but daughters may inherit if no sons exist, and their children carry legitimate claims through the maternal line.

[[The Mad King]] was called mad because he believed something terrible was coming. He was right. He just made it worse.

## Tone & Themes

**Tone:** A blend of Low and High Fantasy with heavy Political Fantasy elements. Magic exists and matters, but the world is grounded in realistic politics, scheming factions, and morally complex choices. Heroes can rise, but they'll navigate courts and conspiracies as much as dungeons. The mature rating allows for graphic violence, adult themes, and horror elements to be fully explored.

**Inspirations:**
- Game of Thrones — Political intrigue, morally gray characters, consequences matter
- Lord of the Rings — Epic scope, ancient history resonates, rare but powerful magic
- Medieval Europe — Grounded feudal systems, castles, courts, and trade
- Octopath Traveler — Diverse regions with distinct identities, personal stories interwoven with grand conflicts

**Core Themes:**
- **Power and Corruption** — Those who seek the throne may lose themselves
- **Redemption** — Even the fallen can rise again
- **Legacy and Heritage** — The sins and glories of ancestors shape the present
- **Freedom vs Security** — What price is peace worth?
- **Faith and Doubt** — Gods may be real, but faith is still tested
- **War and Peace** — Conflict has costs, but so does its absence
- **Duty vs Desire** — The crown is heavy; the heart wants what it wants
- **Class and Inequality** — Lords feast while peasants starve
- **Monsters and Humanity** — The beast may wear a noble face

**Intended Player Feelings:**
- Dread and tension — Something is wrong, and the unease never fades
- Political intrigue — Every smile hides a knife
- Mystery and secrets — The truth is buried and dangerous
- Horror and revulsion — The dead walk; the corruption is visceral
- Righteous anger — Injustice demands someone do something
- Moral complexity — No faction is purely good; every choice has a cost
- Rebellion — The system is broken; burning it down might be the only answer

## Central Conflict

### The Succession Crisis

[[High King Aldric II]] is dead, and no clear successor unites the realm. Four factions vie for power:

**[[House Valdren]]** — [[Lord Varic Valdren]] serves as regent for his grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]], age fifteen, who carries the strongest blood claim to the throne. [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] claims to protect the boy's birthright; in truth, he intends to rule through him indefinitely—or remove him if he proves difficult.

**[[House Thorne]]** — [[Lady Margret Thorne]], aging matriarch of the house that sacrificed most in [[The Great War|the Great War]], believes her family paid for the crown in blood. She has three sons, all veterans, all hungry. She would rather see the realm burn than kneel to a child or his scheming grandfather.

**[[House Karath]]** — Once loyalists to [[The Mad King]], [[House Karath]] was stripped of lands and forced to bend the knee. [[Lord Draven Karath]] has spent twenty years pretending to be beaten. He claims [[The Mad King]] was not mad at all—just betrayed. He has been in contact with something in [[The Karath Reach]] that promises power.

**[[The Faith of the Three]]** — [[High Confessor Maren]] believes no mortal house deserves the throne. He preaches that only a ruler chosen by divine mandate can heal the realm. His visions have been getting darker—and they please him more than they should.

### The Rising Dead

In [[The Ashen Fields]] where [[The Great War]]'s bloodiest battle was fought, the dead are waking. Not as mindless undead—they rise with wounds still fresh, still fighting the battles that killed them. Valdren soldiers attack Karath men; Karath men attack Valdren. The corruption spreads outward. Those who die near it rise within days.

Worse: a figure has been seen walking among the graves. Tall. Wearing a crown of blackened iron. Some say it's [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s ghost. Others whisper he never truly died.

### The Darkness Beneath

*See: [[The Unnamed]]*

What [[The Mad King]] sought—what drove his madness and his tyranny—sleeps beneath [[The Ashen Fields]]. [[The Unnamed]] is not a god, not a demon, but something older and hungrier: a void that feeds on souls denied their passage to the Chronicler's rest. It has slumbered since before recorded history, bound by ancient shamans whose rituals became [[The Faith of the Three]]'s covenant with the dead.

[[The Great War]] broke that covenant. When 10,000 souls were trapped at [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]—their deaths too violent, too sudden for proper rites—they fed the thing below. Now it stirs, reaching upward through the figure that wears [[The Blackened Crown]], commanding the risen dead, whispering to those who listen.

**Those In Contact:**
- [[Lord Draven Karath]] hears its voice in dreams, believing it to be ancestral spirits promising restoration
- [[Yelena Karath]] has gone deeper—she knows what it is, and serves it anyway
- [[High Confessor Maren]]'s visions may come from the Unnamed rather than [[The Faith of the Three|the Three]]

**The Hope:** [[Grimhild the Smith]] receives dreams of a blade that might kill what cannot die. [[The Grey Wardens]] fight to hold the line. If [[The Blackened Crown]] can be destroyed while a legitimate monarch wears [[The Iron Crown]], the trapped souls may be released—starving the Unnamed back into slumber.

### The Ticking Clocks

- **Months:** Open war between the houses
- **One Year:** The curse spreads beyond [[The Karath Reach|the scarred lands]]; villages go silent
- **Two Years:** The realm bleeds itself too weak to fight what's coming
- **Five Years:** There is no realm—only the dead, and whoever rules them

## World State

**Age:** Late Medieval — Centuries of history, established feudal systems, great stone castles, entrenched traditions. But the old orders are crumbling. The war shattered assumptions about loyalty and divine right.

**State:** Tension — For twenty-three years, [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] held the realm together. That peace was a lie maintained by one man's diplomacy. He's been dead for three months. The cracks are showing. War hasn't erupted yet, but everyone is positioning. The storm has gathered; the lightning is about to strike.

## Magic

*See: [[Magic of Eldermyr]]*

Magic in Eldermyr is **rare** (roughly 1 in 1,000 possess any ability) and comes from multiple sources: divine grant, bloodlines, academic study, ancestral spirits, and darker pacts. Society's view varies by type—temple-trained healers are respected; academic mages are distrusted; and practitioners of forbidden arts are hunted.

**Key Points:**
- Divine magic flows from [[The Faith of the Three]]
- Old bloodlines carry inherited power (tied to noble houses)
- [[The Arcane Academy]] trains academic mages under strict oversight
- [[The Spirit-Speakers|Spirit-Speakers]] commune with ancestor spirits (tolerated folk tradition)
- Necromancy, soul magic, and demon summoning are absolutely forbidden
- Protections exist: cold iron, sacred ground, and true faith resist dark magic

## Artifacts of Power

Two crowns define the struggle for Eldermyr's future—one legitimate, one corrupted. Their fates are intertwined.

### [[The Iron Crown]]
The symbol of legitimate rule, forged 800 years ago from Greycrown iron with a drop of the First King's blood. Every High King has worn it since the founding. The Crown grants authority to its wearer and punishes usurpers. Currently, it rests vacant in [[Aldersgate]]'s Ironthrone Hall—refusing to accept any claimant.

**Why won't the Crown accept anyone?** Theories circulate:
- The coronation rite is incomplete (the realm is not at peace; a required oath cannot be sworn)
- [[The Unnamed]]'s awakening has corrupted the covenant between Crown and realm
- The Crown awaits a specific bloodline—not Valdren, not Thorne, perhaps not even the current royal line
- [[The Mad King]]'s crimes broke something in the Crown's magic that hasn't healed
- The legitimate heir hasn't yet presented themselves (conspiracies abound about hidden bastards or lost branches)

When [[Edric Valdren]] reached toward the Crown at [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]]'s urging, he cried out in pain. The Crown burned him. No one has tried since.

### [[The Blackened Crown]]
[[The Mad King]]'s creation, forged through blood sacrifice and necromancy. It contains the souls of 10,000 dead from [[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]—specifically those who died within the binding circle Valdus inscribed on the field, denied the Chronicler's rites—serving as the anchor that connects [[The Unnamed]] to the surface world.

**The Figure:** [[The Grey Wardens]] have confirmed this is not rumor. Warden-Commander Mira Duskwell's patrol found tracks, disturbed graves, and three Wardens dead with wounds matching weapons that haven't been forged in twenty-three years. One survivor saw the figure clearly before dying: a crowned corpse in rotting purple and gold, one eye socket empty, the other burning red. The Wardens believe it is [[The Mad King]] himself—Valdus—preserved in undeath by his own artifact. [[Lord Draven Karath]] believes it is his grandfather waiting to reclaim what was taken. Both may be right.

### [[Grimhild's Commission]]
In [[Hammerhall]], the legendary smith [[Grimhild the Smith|Grimhild]] forges something unprecedented—a blade meant to kill what cannot die. She receives visions guiding her work, requires materials from beyond [[Ostmark Pass]], and may represent the realm's only hope against [[The Unnamed]].

**Prophecy:** "When iron meets iron, one shall break." If the Blackened Crown is destroyed while a true monarch wears the Iron Crown, the trapped souls will be released.

## The Divine

*See: [[The Faith of the Three]]*

The realm worships the **Three**—three equal gods who established the divine covenant:

| Deity | Domain | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| **The Warden** | Order, Justice, Rule | Patron of kings and courts |
| **The Shepherd** | Mercy, Healing, Community | Beloved by common folk |
| **The Chronicler** | Memory, Death, Rest | Keeper of the dead |

The dead rising from [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] violates the most sacred promise: that the Chronicler ensures all souls find rest. Something is **intercepting souls** before they can reach the afterlife. This theological crisis compounds the political one.

**The Faith's Crisis:**
- **Schism risk:** Bishops argue over interpretation. Some blame the realm's sins; others blame specific houses; some whisper the Three have abandoned Eldermyr
- **The Ash Penitents** grow daily—flagellants who believe the rising dead are divine punishment and only mass repentance will end it
- **Heresy trials** have resumed in [[Thornhall]] for the first time in a century; anyone with unconventional views about death is suspect
- **The Synod is paralyzed:** Half support [[High Confessor Maren]]'s divine mandate claims; half believe he's gone mad—or worse
- **Mob violence:** In some towns, anyone accused of necromancy—or even knowing someone accused—faces burning without trial

Nobody has playbooks for this. Everyone is improvising and lying about it.

**Other Traditions:**
- **The Old Ways** — Pre-Faith ancestor veneration and land spirits (tolerated in rural areas)
- **Regional Variations** — The Warden's Hand (East), The Shepherd's Path (West), The Chronicler's Silence (North)
- **Heresies** — The Ash Penitents grow, believing the dead are divine punishment

## Geography

Eldermyr is a large kingdom—roughly comparable to medieval France—dominating the central-western portion of its continent. Natural borders define the realm: mountains to [[The Northlands|the north]] and east, sea to the west and south. Other kingdoms exist beyond these borders but are distant concerns; the real conflict is internal.

## History

### [[The Faith of the Three|The Three]] Ages

Eldermyr's history divides into three eras:

| Age | Duration | Character |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Age of Clans** | Ancient | Scattered tribes, petty wars, fragmented worship |
| **Age of Kings** | ~500 years | Unified realm, flourishing civilization, established order |
| **Age of Ashes** | 27 years–present | [[The Mad King]]'s rise, [[The Great War]], and the broken peace |

### The Age of Clans (Ancient)

Before unification, the land was divided among countless clans and petty kingdoms. The Northfolk kept to their forests; the coastal traders built their harbors; the highlanders fortified their peaks. [[The Faith of the Three]] had not yet unified the people—ancestor spirits, land gods, and local cults held sway.

What ended this age is a matter of legend. Some say a great king arose who united the clans through conquest. Others say a shared enemy forced alliance. The Chronicler's records from this period are fragmentary at best.

### The Age of Kings (~500 Years)

Five centuries of unified rule. The great houses rose to prominence. [[The Faith of the Three]] spread across the realm, absorbing or suppressing local traditions. [[The Eastern March]] was established to guard against foreign powers. [[The Western Shore]] grew wealthy through trade. [[The Crown Lands]] became the heart of civilization.

This age saw periods of peace and war, wise kings and foolish ones, but the realm endured. The structures built during this time—the great castles, the roads, the church hierarchy—still form the bones of Eldermyr.

### The Age of Ashes (27 years–present)

Twenty-seven years ago, High King Valdus I began having visions. He became convinced something ancient and terrible was stirring beneath the realm. His response was escalating paranoia, purges of suspected traitors, and eventually forbidden rituals meant to strengthen himself against the coming darkness.

Whether [[The Mad King|the Mad King]] was truly insane or genuinely prescient, his methods were monstrous. He demanded absolute obedience, executed dissent, and began consorting with powers better left alone.

### [[The Great War]] (27–23 years ago)

Half the realm rose in rebellion, led by [[The Mad King]]'s own son, Prince [[Prince Edric the Liberator|Edric]]. The war lasted four years—brother against brother, house against house. Loyalists included [[House Karath]] and elements of [[The Faith of the Three]]; rebels included Houses Thorne and Valdren.

**Key Events:**
- **The Breaking of the Synod** — High Confessor Alaric declared for [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]; half the clergy defected
- **The Siege of [[Stahlburg]]** — [[House Thorne]] held for eight months before switching sides
- **[[The Eastern March|The March]] of Ash** — [[The Mad King]]'s final campaign burned a swath through the Karath heartland
- **[[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]** — The climactic battle where 30,000 died in a single day

**The Parricide:** Prince [[Prince Edric the Liberator|Edric]] confronted his father on the battlefield. Something happened—witnesses disagree on what—and both died. Some say [[Prince Edric the Liberator|Edric]] killed [[The Mad King]] but was mortally wounded. Others whisper darker tales of ritual, sacrifice, or [[The Mad King]]'s final curse.

**Aftermath:** Prince Aldric, the second son, took the crown as [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] "[[High King Aldric II|the Steward]]." He spent twenty-three years holding the realm together through diplomacy, careful marriages, and measured justice. He was neither loved nor feared—but he was necessary.

### The Present Crisis (3 months ago–now)

[[High King Aldric II]] died in his sleep. Some say his heart gave out after years of stress. Half the realm whispers poison—likely from multiple sources with different suspects depending on who's whispering.

The throne stands empty. [[Lord Varic Valdren]] has claimed regency for his fifteen-year-old grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] (named for the hero-prince). [[House Thorne]] disputes this claim. [[House Karath]] smiles and waits. And in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]], the dead are rising—still fighting the battles that killed them twenty-three years ago.

Valdus feared what was waking. Now it's awake.

## Campaign Start Frames

Choose one when launching the campaign:

### The Court Game (Aldersgate)
The party begins in the capital during the regency crisis. They might be minor nobles, household guards, investigators, or outsiders drawn into court politics. **First session hook:** A body is found in the palace—someone important, killed impossibly—and the party is either suspects or investigators.

### The Border War (Eastern March)
The party begins in [[House Thorne]] territory as war preparations accelerate. They might be soldiers, mercenaries, March wardens, or refugees fleeing the coming storm. **First session hook:** [[Ser Konrad Thorne]] needs escort for a secret mission to [[Hammerhall]]—and someone doesn't want them to arrive.

### Horror Containment (Grey Wardens / Ashen Fields)
The party begins as [[The Grey Wardens|Grey Wardens]], Warden recruits, or specialists hired to support the containment effort. **First session hook:** The forward post has gone silent. The party is sent to find out why—and encounters risen dead that speak, that beg for release, that remember.

### The Karath Gambit (Chernogrod)
The party begins in [[House Karath]] territory—perhaps as agents, prisoners offered freedom, or outsiders with business in the scarred lands. **First session hook:** [[Lord Draven Karath]] offers a bargain: retrieve something from [[The Ashen Fields]], and he'll grant whatever you need. He doesn't mention what guards it.
