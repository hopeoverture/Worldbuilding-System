# Eldermyr

> *"[[The Great War]] ended a generation ago, but peace has not healed Eldermyr. The victorious houses have grown arrogant; the defeated nurse their hatred in silence. And in [[The Karath Reach|the scarred lands]] where the worst battles raged, something is growing in the mass graves that no one has dared to visit."*

## Premise

Twenty-three years ago, the realm tore itself apart. [[High King Aldric II]] I—[[The Mad King]]—was slain by his own son in a war that left fields of corpses and a kingdom of orphans. His younger son, [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]], spent two decades holding the broken pieces together through compromise, marriage alliances, and carefully measured justice.

Three months ago, [[High King Aldric II|the Steward]] King died in his sleep. Some say his heart gave out. Half the realm whispers poison.

Now the great houses circle each other like wolves. The victors have grown fat and cruel; the defeated have never stopped sharpening their knives. A boy of fifteen holds the strongest claim to the throne, but power respects nothing so fragile as blood. And in [[The Karath Reach|the scarred lands]] where the war's worst battles raged, the dead are beginning to stir—still fighting, still bleeding, still loyal to causes that should have died with them.

[[The Mad King]] was called mad because he believed something terrible was coming. He was right. He just made it worse.

## Tone & Themes

**Tone:** A blend of Low and High Fantasy with heavy Political Fantasy elements. Magic exists and matters, but the world is grounded in realistic politics, scheming factions, and morally complex choices. Heroes can rise, but they'll navigate courts and conspiracies as much as dungeons. The mature rating allows for graphic violence, adult themes, and horror elements to be fully explored.

**Inspirations:**
- Game of Thrones — Political intrigue, morally gray characters, consequences matter
- Lord of the Rings — Epic scope, ancient history resonates, rare but powerful magic
- Medieval Europe — Grounded feudal systems, castles, courts, and trade
- Octopath Traveler — Diverse regions with distinct identities, personal stories interwoven with grand conflicts

**Core Themes:**
- **Power and Corruption** — Those who seek the throne may lose themselves
- **Redemption** — Even the fallen can rise again
- **Legacy and Heritage** — The sins and glories of ancestors shape the present
- **Freedom vs Security** — What price is peace worth?
- **Faith and Doubt** — Gods may be real, but faith is still tested
- **War and Peace** — Conflict has costs, but so does its absence
- **Duty vs Desire** — The crown is heavy; the heart wants what it wants
- **Class and Inequality** — Lords feast while peasants starve
- **Monsters and Humanity** — The beast may wear a noble face

**Intended Player Feelings:**
- Dread and tension — Something is wrong, and the unease never fades
- Political intrigue — Every smile hides a knife
- Mystery and secrets — The truth is buried and dangerous
- Horror and revulsion — The dead walk; the corruption is visceral
- Righteous anger — Injustice demands someone do something
- Moral complexity — No faction is purely good; every choice has a cost
- Rebellion — The system is broken; burning it down might be the only answer

## Central Conflict

### The Succession Crisis

[[High King Aldric II]] is dead, and no clear successor unites the realm. Four factions vie for power:

**[[House Valdren]]** — [[Lord Varic Valdren]] serves as regent for his grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]], age fifteen, who carries the strongest blood claim to the throne. [[Lord Varic Valdren|Varic]] claims to protect the boy's birthright; in truth, he intends to rule through him indefinitely—or remove him if he proves difficult.

**[[House Thorne]]** — [[Lady Margret Thorne]], aging matriarch of the house that sacrificed most in [[The Great War|the Great War]], believes her family paid for the crown in blood. She has three sons, all veterans, all hungry. She would rather see the realm burn than kneel to a child or his scheming grandfather.

**[[House Karath]]** — Once loyalists to [[The Mad King]], [[House Karath]] was stripped of lands and forced to bend the knee. [[Lord Draven Karath]] has spent twenty years pretending to be beaten. He claims [[The Mad King]] was not mad at all—just betrayed. He has been in contact with something in [[The Karath Reach]] that promises power.

**[[The Faith of the Three]]** — [[High Confessor Maren]] believes no mortal house deserves the throne. He preaches that only a ruler chosen by divine mandate can heal the realm. His visions have been getting darker—and they please him more than they should.

### The Rising Dead

In [[The Ashen Fields]] where [[The Great War]]'s bloodiest battle was fought, the dead are waking. Not as mindless undead—they rise with wounds still fresh, still fighting the battles that killed them. Valdren soldiers attack Karath men; Karath men attack Valdren. The corruption spreads outward. Those who die near it rise within days.

Worse: a figure has been seen walking among the graves. Tall. Wearing a crown of blackened iron. Some say it's [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]'s ghost. Others whisper he never truly died.

### The Ticking Clocks

- **Months:** Open war between the houses
- **One Year:** The curse spreads beyond [[The Karath Reach|the scarred lands]]; villages go silent
- **Two Years:** The realm bleeds itself too weak to fight what's coming
- **Five Years:** There is no realm—only the dead, and whoever rules them

## World State

**Age:** Late Medieval — Centuries of history, established feudal systems, great stone castles, entrenched traditions. But the old orders are crumbling. The war shattered assumptions about loyalty and divine right.

**State:** Tension — For twenty-three years, [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] held the realm together. That peace was a lie maintained by one man's diplomacy. He's been dead for three months. The cracks are showing. War hasn't erupted yet, but everyone is positioning. The storm has gathered; the lightning is about to strike.

## Magic

*See: [[Magic of Eldermyr]]*

Magic in Eldermyr is **rare** (roughly 1 in 1,000 possess any ability) and comes from multiple sources: divine grant, bloodlines, academic study, ancestral spirits, and darker pacts. Society's view varies by type—temple-trained healers are respected; academic mages are distrusted; and practitioners of forbidden arts are hunted.

**Key Points:**
- Divine magic flows from [[The Faith of the Three]]
- Old bloodlines carry inherited power (tied to noble houses)
- The [[Arcane Academy]] trains academic mages under strict oversight
- [[The Spirit-Speakers|Spirit-Speakers]] commune with ancestor spirits (tolerated folk tradition)
- Necromancy, soul magic, and demon summoning are absolutely forbidden
- Protections exist: cold iron, sacred ground, and true faith resist dark magic

## The Divine

*See: [[The Faith of the Three]]*

The realm worships the **Three**—three equal gods who established the divine covenant:

| Deity | Domain | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| **The Warden** | Order, Justice, Rule | Patron of kings and courts |
| **The Shepherd** | Mercy, Healing, Community | Beloved by common folk |
| **The Chronicler** | Memory, Death, Rest | Keeper of the dead |

The dead rising from [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]] violates the most sacred promise: that the Chronicler ensures all souls find rest. Something is **intercepting souls** before they can reach the afterlife. This theological crisis compounds the political one.

**Other Traditions:**
- **The Old Ways** — Pre-Faith ancestor veneration and land spirits (tolerated in rural areas)
- **Regional Variations** — The Warden's Hand (East), The Shepherd's Path (West), The Chronicler's Silence (North)
- **Heresies** — The Ash Penitents grow, believing the dead are divine punishment

## Geography

Eldermyr is a large kingdom—roughly comparable to medieval France—dominating the central-western portion of its continent. Natural borders define the realm: mountains to [[The Northlands|the north]] and east, sea to the west and south. Other kingdoms exist beyond these borders but are distant concerns; the real conflict is internal.

## History

### [[The Faith of the Three|The Three]] Ages

Eldermyr's history divides into three eras:

| Age | Duration | Character |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Age of Clans** | Ancient | Scattered tribes, petty wars, fragmented worship |
| **Age of Kings** | ~500 years | Unified realm, flourishing civilization, established order |
| **Age of Ashes** | 27 years–present | [[The Mad King]]'s rise, [[The Great War]], and the broken peace |

### The Age of Clans (Ancient)

Before unification, the land was divided among countless clans and petty kingdoms. The Northfolk kept to their forests; the coastal traders built their harbors; the highlanders fortified their peaks. [[The Faith of the Three]] had not yet unified the people—ancestor spirits, land gods, and local cults held sway.

What ended this age is a matter of legend. Some say a great king arose who united the clans through conquest. Others say a shared enemy forced alliance. The Chronicler's records from this period are fragmentary at best.

### The Age of Kings (~500 Years)

Five centuries of unified rule. The great houses rose to prominence. [[The Faith of the Three]] spread across the realm, absorbing or suppressing local traditions. [[The Eastern March]] was established to guard against foreign powers. [[The Western Shore]] grew wealthy through trade. [[The Crown Lands]] became the heart of civilization.

This age saw periods of peace and war, wise kings and foolish ones, but the realm endured. The structures built during this time—the great castles, the roads, the church hierarchy—still form the bones of Eldermyr.

### The Age of Ashes (27 years–present)

Twenty-seven years ago, [[High King Aldric II|King Aldric]] I began having visions. He became convinced something ancient and terrible was stirring beneath the realm. His response was escalating paranoia, purges of suspected traitors, and eventually forbidden rituals meant to strengthen himself against the coming darkness.

Whether [[The Mad King|the Mad King]] was truly insane or genuinely prescient, his methods were monstrous. He demanded absolute obedience, executed dissent, and began consorting with powers better left alone.

### [[The Great War]] (27–23 years ago)

Half the realm rose in rebellion, led by [[The Mad King]]'s own son, Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]]. The war lasted four years—brother against brother, house against house. Loyalists included [[House Karath]] and elements of [[The Faith of the Three]]; rebels included Houses Thorne and Valdren.

**Key Events:**
- **The Breaking of the Synod** — High Confessor Alaric declared for [[The Mad King|the Mad King]]; half the clergy defected
- **The Siege of [[Stahlburg]]** — [[House Thorne]] held for eight months before switching sides
- **[[The Eastern March|The March]] of Ash** — [[The Mad King]]'s final campaign burned a swath through the Karath heartland
- **[[The Battle of Ashen Fields]]** — The climactic battle where 30,000 died in a single day

**The Parricide:** Prince [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] confronted his father on the battlefield. Something happened—witnesses disagree on what—and both died. Some say [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] killed [[The Mad King]] but was mortally wounded. Others whisper darker tales of ritual, sacrifice, or [[The Mad King]]'s final curse.

**Aftermath:** Prince Aldric, the second son, took the crown as [[High King Aldric II|Aldric II]] "[[High King Aldric II|the Steward]]." He spent twenty-three years holding the realm together through diplomacy, careful marriages, and measured justice. He was neither loved nor feared—but he was necessary.

### The Present Crisis (3 months ago–now)

[[High King Aldric II]] died in his sleep. Some say his heart gave out after years of stress. Half the realm whispers poison—likely from multiple sources with different suspects depending on who's whispering.

The throne stands empty. [[Lord Varic Valdren]] has claimed regency for his fifteen-year-old grandson [[Edric Valdren|Edric]] (named for the hero-prince). [[House Thorne]] disputes this claim. [[House Karath]] smiles and waits. And in [[The Ashen Fields|the Ashen Fields]], the dead are rising—still fighting the battles that killed them twenty-three years ago.

[[The Mad King]] was right. Something was coming. He just made it worse.
