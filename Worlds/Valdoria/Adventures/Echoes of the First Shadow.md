> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
The Inner Shield is down, but the ritual is complete. The **Imprisoned** cannot fully escape yet, but it has projected its consciousness into a vessel—the **Avatar of the First Shadow**. The party must enter the Prison's antechamber, defeat the Covenant's high leadership, and banish the Avatar back into the void before it can shatter the world foundation.
