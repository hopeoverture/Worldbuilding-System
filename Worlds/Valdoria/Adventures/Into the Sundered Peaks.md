# Into the Sundered Peaks

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
The Siege of Grey Keep is broken, but the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] has fled deeper into the mountains toward the [[The Obsidian Fortress|Obsidian Gate]]—a prison-fortress built by the Architects to contain [[The Shackled God]]. The only path forward is through the **Dragon's Spine**, a treacherous stretch of the [[The Sundered Peaks]] where razor-sharp ridges, magical blizzards, and ancient predators have claimed countless lives. Worse still, the pass is guarded by **Cryonax the White Silence**, an Ancient White Dragon who has allied with the Imprisoned in exchange for dominion over the frozen wastes. The party must survive the mountain's wrath and either evade or destroy the dragon to reach the Obsidian Gate before the final seal is broken.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Wilderness Survival / Dragon Hunt

**Tone:** Desolate / Survivalist / Epic

**Themes:**
- Isolation and the indifference of nature
- Apex predators and the food chain
- The cost of heroism
- Endurance against impossible odds

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 3-4 Sessions

**Party Level:** 8 (advancement to 9 during or after adventure)

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Deadly

**Combat Frequency:** Low (2-3 encounters, but each is deadly)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Low (survival focus, limited NPCs)

**Exploration Emphasis:** Very High (primary challenge)

## The Hook

### How It Begins
In the aftermath of [[Siege of the Grey Keep]], the party interrogates a captured Covenant officer or discovers documents revealing the cult's destination: the **Obsidian Gate**, deep within the Sundered Peaks. [[Lieutenant Mara]] confirms that the only viable route is through the Dragon's Spine—a crossing that has killed every expedition sent in the last century. She provides what maps exist and warns them of the dragon that lairs in the high pass. Time is critical; the Covenant has a two-day head start.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Lieutenant Mara]] / Self-Motivated
**Motivation:** Stop the Covenant from reaching the Obsidian Gate and completing the ritual to free the Imprisoned
**What They Offer:** Provisions, cold-weather gear, a partial map of the Dragon's Spine, and information about Cryonax gathered from old dwarven records

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The Covenant's leaders fled through a mountain pass called the Dragon's Spine
- The pass is guarded by an Ancient White Dragon named Cryonax
- The mountains are plagued by magical blizzards, avalanches, and Remorhaz
- The only other route would take three weeks and the ritual could complete in days
- A dwarven outpost called **Frosthollow** lies at the base of the ascent—the last safe haven

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Critical

**Consequences of Delay:** Every day lost gives the Covenant more time to prepare the ritual. If the party takes more than 5 days to cross, the Covenant will have completed the outer wards of the Obsidian Gate, making the next adventure significantly harder (additional encounters, reinforced defenses).

## Background

### The Situation
The Dragon's Spine is a 40-mile stretch of the Sundered Peaks where the mountains reach their highest and most treacherous. The pass climbs to 18,000 feet through glaciers, knife-edge ridges, and wind-blasted plateaus. The region is suffused with residual magic from the Sealing, causing unpredictable storms and wild magic zones. Cryonax, an Ancient White Dragon, has laired here for three centuries, feasting on anything foolish enough to enter his domain. Recently, emissaries of the Imprisoned contacted him through dreams, promising him sovereignty over all frozen lands once the Shackled God is freed. Cryonax now actively patrols the pass, serving as the Covenant's guardian whether they know it or not.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- The Dragon's Spine was always dangerous—ancient dwarven records call it "Shakhul-gund" (the Bone Road)
- Cryonax claimed the territory 300 years ago after driving out a clan of frost giants
- The dragon has accumulated a vast hoard from caravans, expeditions, and dwarven tribute
- The Covenant discovered Cryonax two years ago and began corrupting him through shadow-touched dreams
- The Imprisoned promised Cryonax power beyond any dragon—a chance to become something eternal

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| **Cryonax** | Guard the pass, feast on intruders | Aerial hunting, lair ambushes, blizzard manipulation |
| **[[The Prophet of Chains]]** | Reach the Obsidian Gate | Already through; left Cryonax to delay pursuit |
| **Thorgrim Icepick** (Dwarven Guide) | Survive and return home | Knowledge of safe routes, reluctant assistance |
| **The Imprisoned** | Delay or destroy the heroes | Sends visions to Cryonax, empowers his lair |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** They reach the Obsidian Gate with time to infiltrate before the ritual completes. If they slay Cryonax, the dragon threat is eliminated and the dwarves may reclaim the high passes.

**If the party fails:** They die in the mountains, the Covenant completes the ritual unopposed, and the Shackled God's prison begins to crack. The world descends into shadow.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Cross the Dragon's Spine and reach the Obsidian Gate within 5 days.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Slay Cryonax the White Silence (removes the dragon threat permanently)
2. Recover the Frostcrown Circlet from Cryonax's hoard (powerful magic item)
3. Locate the Covenant's supply cache in the mountains (reveals their numbers and plans)
4. Free any survivors from previous expeditions trapped in the ice caves

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Find evidence that the Imprisoned is communicating directly with Cryonax (shadow whispers, corrupted ice)
2. Discover an ancient dwarven shortcut through the mountains (the Icevein Tunnels)

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- At least one party member reaches the far side of the Dragon's Spine alive
- Arrival within 5 days to maintain tactical advantage

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- Total party kill from environmental hazards, Remorhaz, or Cryonax
- Taking more than 7 days (Covenant completes defensive preparations; adventure continues but harder)
- Turning back (Covenant wins; campaign potentially ends in failure)

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Ascent
**Goal:** Reach the high pass while surviving environmental hazards.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **Frosthollow Outpost:** The party resupplies at a dwarven waystation. They meet **Thorgrim Icepick**, a grizzled mountaineer who lost his brother to the peaks. He can serve as a guide (if persuaded) or provide crucial information about safe routes, weather patterns, and Cryonax's hunting schedule.
2. **The Glacier Crossing:** A miles-wide glacier riddled with crevasses. Navigation requires skill checks; failure means falling into ice caves or triggering an avalanche.
3. **The Blizzard:** A magical storm descends, forcing the party to find shelter or risk exhaustion and frostbite. Constitution saves against Extreme Cold; failure causes exhaustion levels.

**Information to Reveal:**
- Cryonax hunts primarily at dawn and dusk
- The dragon's lair is in the Ice Caves of Amon Uilos, directly in their path
- The Covenant passed through two days ago—signs of their passage visible in the snow

**Transition to Act 2:** The party reaches the high pass and must choose: attempt to sneak past the Ice Caves or enter to confront Cryonax.

### Act 2: The Lair
**Goal:** Navigate (or clear) the Ice Caves and locate a path through the mountain.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **Frozen Victims:** The party discovers a cavern filled with frozen adventurers, merchants, and dwarves—Cryonax's "gallery." Some still have useful equipment; all serve as a grim warning.
2. **The Remorhaz Nest:** A side tunnel leads to a nest of Remorhaz (young and adult). The party can fight through, sneak past, or collapse the tunnel behind them.
3. **The Hoard Chamber:** Cryonax's treasure vault—mountains of gold, gems, and magic items. The dragon may or may not be present. Taking treasure risks alerting him.

**Rising Tension:** The deeper the party goes, the more signs of shadow corruption they find—ice that whispers, darkness that moves, cold that drains more than warmth.

**Midpoint Twist:** The party finds Covenant corpses in the caves—stragglers who didn't make it through. On one body: a ritual scroll revealing that the Imprisoned has been speaking directly to Cryonax, promising him transformation into something beyond a dragon.

**Transition to Act 3:** The party emerges from the caves onto the Peak of Storms, Cryonax's hunting ground and the final obstacle before descent to the Obsidian Gate.

### Act 3: The Tyrant
**Goal:** Cross the Peak of Storms and either evade or destroy Cryonax.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Narrow Way:** A knife-edge ridge with 1,000-foot drops on either side. Wind threatens to push climbers off. Dexterity saves required; failure means hanging by a rope or falling.
2. **The Dragon Descends:** Cryonax attacks when the party is most exposed. He uses hit-and-run tactics, breath weapon strafing, and the terrain to his advantage.

**Climactic Encounter:** **Cryonax, the White Silence** battles the party on the Peak of Storms. This is a multi-phase encounter with environmental hazards, lair actions, and legendary actions. The dragon fights intelligently—retreating if bloodied, using terrain, and exploiting the party's exhaustion.

**Resolution Options:**
- **Slay Cryonax:** The dragon is destroyed; the party claims his hoard and earns legendary renown
- **Drive Off Cryonax:** The dragon retreats to heal; he may return in a future adventure
- **Evade Cryonax:** Through stealth, deception, or speed, the party bypasses the dragon entirely (possible but very difficult)
- **Negotiate with Cryonax:** Unlikely but possible—the dragon could be convinced that the Imprisoned will betray him (requires exceptional roleplay and evidence)

## Locations

### Overview Map
The Dragon's Spine runs roughly southwest to northeast through the highest peaks of the Sundered Peaks. The journey covers approximately 40 miles as the crow flies but closer to 60 miles of actual travel due to terrain. Key locations are arranged vertically by altitude:
- Frosthollow Outpost (8,000 ft) - Base camp
- The Glacier of Tears (10,000-12,000 ft) - Ice crossing
- The Ice Caves of Amon Uilos (14,000-16,000 ft) - Cryonax's lair
- Peak of Storms (18,000 ft) - Summit and dragon's hunting ground
- The Descent (16,000-12,000 ft) - Path to the Obsidian Gate

### Primary Location: The Dragon's Spine
**Name:** The Dragon's Spine

**Description:** A 40-mile stretch of the [[The Sundered Peaks]] where jagged black rock tears through eternal ice. The peaks here reach impossible heights, their summits lost in clouds that crackle with purple lightning. The wind never stops screaming. The cold is a living thing that seeks to devour warmth. Ancient dwarven markers, now half-buried in snow, trace a path that fewer than one in ten travelers survive.

**Key Features:**
- Knife-edge ridges requiring climbing/balance checks
- Crevasse fields that can swallow unwary travelers
- Wild magic zones that disrupt spells and create random effects
- Altitude sickness above 12,000 feet
- Perpetual twilight due to storm clouds

**Encounters Here:** Environmental hazards, avalanches, blizzards

### Location 2: The Ice Caves of Amon Uilos
**Description:** A vast network of natural caverns carved into the peak of Amon Uilos (Everwhite), the third-highest mountain in the range. The caves are beautiful and deadly—walls of blue-white ice, frozen waterfalls, and chambers that sparkle like diamonds. Cryonax has laired here for three centuries, filling the deepest chambers with his hoard.

**Key Features:**
- Frozen gallery of previous victims
- Remorhaz nesting tunnels (heated by the creatures)
- The Hoard Chamber with treasure and traps
- Shadow-corrupted ice that whispers and moves
- Multiple routes through (stealth possible)

**Encounters Here:** Young Remorhaz, Adult Remorhaz, potentially Cryonax

### Location 3: Peak of Storms
**Description:** The highest point of the crossing at 18,000 feet, a wind-blasted plateau of black rock and ice. Purple lightning arcs between natural stone pillars. The air is so thin that breathing is labored. This is Cryonax's preferred hunting ground—he can see for miles and dive on prey with devastating speed.

**Key Features:**
- Lightning strikes (Dexterity saves)
- Thin air (disadvantage on Constitution saves)
- Open terrain with minimal cover
- Stone pillars that can provide partial concealment
- Sheer drops on all sides

**Encounters Here:** Cryonax (boss encounter)

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Time | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|------|---------|
| Frosthollow | Glacier of Tears | 8 miles | 1 day | Avalanche risk, cold exposure |
| Glacier of Tears | Ice Caves | 12 miles | 1-2 days | Crevasses, blizzard, Remorhaz |
| Ice Caves | Peak of Storms | 5 miles (vertical) | 1 day | Dragon patrol, exhaustion |
| Peak of Storms | Descent | 3 miles | 4-6 hours | Dragon attack, lightning |
| Descent | Obsidian Gate | 12 miles | 1 day | Covenant patrols |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### Thorgrim Icepick
**Role:** Potential Guide (Dwarven Mountaineer)

**Description:** A weathered dwarf with a frost-white beard and eyes that have seen too much death. He wears the furs and leathers of a high-mountain guide, with ice-climbing tools that look older than some civilizations. His left hand is missing two fingers—frostbite claimed them decades ago.

**Personality:** Grim, fatalistic, and gruffly practical. He doesn't waste words. He's seen the mountain kill too many brave fools to have hope, but somewhere beneath the cynicism is a dwarf who once dreamed of reaching the far side.

**What They Want:** To honor his brother Borin's memory (lost to Cryonax twelve years ago) and to finally see the Dragon's Spine crossed.

**What They Know:**
- The safest routes through the glacier
- Cryonax's hunting patterns and weaknesses
- The location of the dwarven emergency caches
- That the Covenant passed through recently—he saw their lights from Frosthollow

**How They Can Help:** Navigation (+5 to Survival checks in the mountains), knowledge of shelter locations, warning of incoming storms, possible combat support (Veteran stats)

### Neutrals

#### The Mountain Itself
**Role:** Environmental Antagonist

**Description:** The Sundered Peaks are not merely difficult terrain—they are actively hostile. Wild magic from the Sealing causes storms to form from nothing, avalanches to trigger without warning, and the cold to bite deeper than natural winter.

**Personality:** Indifferent, implacable, eternal

**What They Want:** Nothing. The mountain simply is.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Complete indifference—the mountain kills without malice

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: Cryonax, the White Silence
**Role:** Guardian of the Pass / Dragon Tyrant

**Description:** Cryonax is an Ancient White Dragon of terrifying size and presence. His scales are the blue-white of glacial ice, thick with frost that never melts. His eyes, once the pale blue of his kind, now hold depths of void-black—a gift from the Imprisoned. When he moves, the temperature drops; when he breathes, glaciers form. He has ruled the Dragon's Spine for three centuries, and every frozen corpse in the mountains is a testament to his power.

**Personality:** Cruel, patient, and utterly convinced of his superiority. Unlike more intellectual dragons, Cryonax thinks in simple terms: hunt, kill, hoard. The Imprisoned's whispers have added a new dimension—dreams of becoming something greater, of ruling an eternal winter. He is more cunning than typical white dragons, evidence of the Imprisoned's influence.

**Motivation:**
- Primary: Protect his territory and hoard
- Secondary: Serve the Imprisoned's interests (destroy those who would stop the ritual)
- Hidden: Become the first dragon to transcend mortality through shadow power

**Methods:**
- Patrols the pass at dawn and dusk from the air
- Uses terrain and weather to his advantage
- Attacks from ambush, using breath weapon first
- Retreats if badly wounded, returns when healed
- Has modified his lair with ice-pit traps and frozen victims positioned as decoys

**Weakness:**
- His ego can be exploited—he will monologue if given the chance
- Fire magic is particularly effective
- He doesn't fully trust the Imprisoned (doubt can be cultivated)
- His modified lair actions require his presence; drawing him out weakens his defenses

**Combat Notes:** Use Ancient White Dragon statistics (CR 20) with the following modifications:
- Void-touched eyes grant Darkvision 240 ft and immunity to the Blinded condition
- Shadow Breath variant: Once per day, breath weapon deals half cold/half necrotic damage and imposes one level of exhaustion (Constitution save)
- Enhanced Lair Actions due to shadow corruption (see Boss Encounter)

#### Secondary Antagonist: The Remorhaz Matriarch
**Role:** Apex Predator of the Ice Caves

**Description:** A massive Adult Remorhaz that has claimed the central tunnels of the Ice Caves as her nest. Her body generates so much heat that the ice around her lair has partially melted, creating a steam-filled labyrinth. She has produced several young that hunt the upper tunnels.

**Connection to Primary:** Cryonax tolerates the Remorhaz because they drive prey toward his lair and eliminate weaker threats. He sometimes feeds them frozen victims he has tired of "displaying."

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: Avalanche Aftermath
**Location:** Glacier of Tears

**Trigger:** Natural or triggered avalanche during glacier crossing

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Ice Mephit | 4 | Drawn by the magical cold |
| Young Remorhaz | 1 | Hunting in the aftermath |

**Tactics:** The Ice Mephits harass the party while the Remorhaz burrows beneath the snow to ambush. The Remorhaz targets isolated characters or those buried by the avalanche.

**Difficulty:** Hard (3,400 XP; adjusted for terrain)

**Terrain Features:**
- Unstable snow (difficult terrain)
- Buried equipment requiring Athletics checks to retrieve
- Crevasses opened by the avalanche
- Partial cover from snow banks

**Rewards:** Young Remorhaz hide (valuable to alchemists, 200 gp)

#### Encounter 2: The Remorhaz Nest
**Location:** Ice Caves of Amon Uilos, lower tunnels

**Trigger:** Party enters Remorhaz territory or makes significant noise in the caves

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Adult Remorhaz | 1 | The Matriarch |
| Young Remorhaz | 2 | Defending the nest |

**Tactics:** The Young Remorhaz attack first while the Matriarch burrows to position herself for a devastating ambush. She targets the most heavily armored character (seeing them as the greatest threat to her young).

**Difficulty:** Deadly (10,700 XP)

**Terrain Features:**
- Steam vents (difficult terrain, obscurement)
- Melted ice creating pools of frigid water
- Narrow tunnels that limit movement
- Remorhaz eggs (destroying them enrages the Matriarch)

**Rewards:**
- Remorhaz chitin (can be crafted into +1 armor)
- Molten core gem from Matriarch (1,000 gp, component for fire magic items)

#### Boss Encounter: The White Silence
**Location:** Peak of Storms

**Setup:** The party emerges onto the exposed plateau. The sky is dark with storm clouds. Purple lightning illuminates a massive white shape circling overhead. Cryonax has been waiting.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Cryonax (Ancient White Dragon) | 1 | Shadow-enhanced |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 (100%-50% HP):** Cryonax opens with a strafing breath weapon from the air, then lands to engage in melee. He uses Frightful Presence to scatter the party and Wing Attack legendary actions to reposition.
2. **Phase 2 (50%-25% HP):** The dragon takes flight again, using hit-and-run tactics. He triggers lair actions more aggressively and uses his Shadow Breath if available.
3. **Phase 3 (Below 25% HP):** Cryonax fights desperately. He may attempt to bargain (offering passage for treasure), flee to heal, or fight to the death depending on circumstances and party actions.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:**

*Shadow-Enhanced Lair Actions (Initiative 20):*
- **Freezing Fog:** 20-foot radius sphere of heavily obscured fog; creatures starting turn inside take 2d6 cold damage
- **Ice Spikes:** 10-foot radius eruption; DC 15 Dexterity save or 3d6 piercing damage and knocked prone
- **Whispers of the Void:** One creature must succeed DC 15 Wisdom save or be Frightened until the next lair action
- **Blinding Snow:** All creatures within 60 feet must succeed DC 15 Constitution save or be Blinded until end of their next turn

*Legendary Actions (3/round):*
- **Detect:** Perception check
- **Tail Attack:** Melee attack
- **Wing Attack (2 actions):** Creatures within 15 feet make DC 22 Dexterity save or take 2d6+8 bludgeoning and be knocked prone; dragon can fly up to half its speed

**Victory Conditions:**
- Reduce Cryonax to 0 HP (death)
- Reduce Cryonax below 50 HP and succeed on DC 20 Persuasion/Intimidation to force retreat
- Survive 10 rounds while retreating across the plateau (dragon gives up chase)

**Rewards:**
- Cryonax's Hoard: 15,000 gp in coins and gems
- *Frostbrand Greatsword*
- *Frostcrown Circlet* (rare; resistance to cold, can cast Sleet Storm 1/day)
- *Dragon Scale Mail* (crafted from remains, AC 14 + Dex modifier, max 2; resistance to cold)
- Dragon parts (teeth, scales, blood) worth 5,000 gp to appropriate buyers

### Social Encounters

#### Negotiating with Thorgrim
**Location:** Frosthollow Outpost

**NPCs Present:** Thorgrim Icepick, other dwarven miners

**Stakes:** Whether the party gains a guide who could significantly improve their survival chances

**Information Available:**
- Safe routes through the glacier
- Cryonax's lair location and patterns
- Location of emergency caches
- Weather prediction (Thorgrim can read the storms)

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 15 | Thorgrim considers joining | He refuses but provides some information |
| Intimidation | 18 | He agrees out of fear (disadvantage on morale checks later) | He becomes hostile |
| Insight | 12 | Reveals his brother died here; can appeal to vengeance | Miss this angle |
| History (Dwarven) | 14 | Knowledge of his clan earns respect | He thinks you're ignorant outsiders |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Thorgrim joins as guide (+5 to Survival, knows shelter locations, will fight)
- Moderate: Thorgrim provides detailed information but won't accompany
- Worst: Thorgrim refuses all help; the party is on their own

### Exploration Challenges

#### The Glacier of Tears Crossing
**Location:** Between Frosthollow and the Ice Caves

**Description:** A vast expanse of ancient ice, cracked and treacherous. The glacier "tears" constantly—the sound of ice shifting and breaking echoes across the white emptiness. Crevasses can open without warning, some dropping hundreds of feet into blue darkness.

**Skills Useful:** Survival (navigation), Perception (spot crevasses), Athletics (climbing/jumping), Nature (predict ice stability)

**Hazards:**
- Crevasses: DC 14 Perception to spot; DC 15 Dexterity save to avoid falling (3d6 to 10d6 falling damage based on depth)
- Avalanche: 10% chance per hour of travel; DC 15 Dexterity save to avoid; failure = buried (suffocation rules) + 4d10 bludgeoning
- Extreme Cold: DC 10 Constitution save each hour or gain one level of Exhaustion

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Dwarven emergency cache (climbing gear, rations, healing potions)
- Frozen explorer with valuable journals (maps, information about Cryonax)
- Shortcut that saves 4 hours of travel

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Cryonax's hunting schedule | Frosthollow | Talk to Thorgrim | Planning when to cross exposed areas |
| Covenant corpse with ritual scroll | Ice Caves | Exploration | Understanding dragon-Imprisoned alliance |
| Shadow corruption in ice | Ice Caves | Perception DC 15 | Evidence the Imprisoned is involved |
| Dwarven shortcut entrance | Glacier | Survival DC 18 or Thorgrim | Alternative route through Icevein Tunnels |
| Cryonax's weakness to fire | Hoard chamber inscriptions | Investigation DC 14 | Combat advantage |
| Dragon's void-touched eyes | Sighting Cryonax | Arcana DC 16 | Understanding his enhanced powers |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. A frozen traveler's journal suggests a "safe" southern route—it leads into frost giant territory
2. Strange lights in the caves that seem like Covenant magic are actually luminescent fungi

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The Imprisoned is not merely using Cryonax—the dragon has been promised apotheosis. If the Imprisoned is freed, Cryonax believes he will become something beyond a dragon: a Void Dragon, immortal and all-powerful. This explains his unusual cunning and his willingness to serve.

**When It's Revealed:** Finding the ritual scroll on the Covenant corpse, or if the party attempts to negotiate with Cryonax and he boasts of his coming transformation.

**Impact:** The party understands the scope of the Imprisoned's corruption—even ancient dragons are being turned. This also provides a potential angle for negotiation: can they convince Cryonax the Imprisoned will betray him?

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Ice Pit | Ice Caves (Hoard entrance) | Pressure plate (snow-covered) | 30-ft fall onto ice spikes | Perception 15 / Dex 14 | 3d6 fall + 2d10 piercing |
| Collapsing Ice Shelf | Ice Caves (Gallery) | Taking treasure from frozen corpses | Ceiling collapse | Dex 16 | 4d10 bludgeoning |
| Frozen Victim Alarm | Ice Caves (Various) | Disturbing certain corpses | Magical alarm alerts Cryonax | Investigation 14 to identify | No damage; Cryonax arrives in 1d4 minutes |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Extreme Cold | Everywhere above 10,000 ft | DC 10+ CON save/hour or Exhaustion | Cold weather gear, fire magic, sheltering |
| Thin Air | Above 14,000 ft | Disadvantage on CON saves; short rests take 2 hours | Slow acclimatization, magic |
| Magical Blizzard | Random (25%/day) | 1d4 hours; visibility 10 ft; DC 12 CON/hour | Shelter (DC 18 Survival to find) |
| Wild Magic Zone | Near summit | Spells trigger Wild Magic table | Avoid casting or accept risk |
| Lightning Strikes | Peak of Storms | DC 15 DEX save or 4d10 lightning | Stay low, avoid metal, move quickly |

### Puzzles

#### The Icevein Door
**Location:** Entrance to dwarven shortcut tunnels (hidden in glacier)

**Description:** A massive door of ice-covered stone, carved with dwarven runes. The door has no visible handle or keyhole—only three rotating rings of runes that must be aligned correctly.

**Solution:** The runes tell a story of the mountain's creation. Aligning them to spell "STONE-OVER-SHADOW" (in Dwarvish) opens the door. This requires reading Dwarvish or DC 18 Intelligence (History) to deduce from context.

**Hints:**
- The outermost ring tells of mountains being raised
- The middle ring speaks of something being buried
- The inner ring names what was imprisoned

**Bypass Options:** DC 25 Strength check to force (alerts Remorhaz), Passwall or similar magic, 10 minutes with mason's tools and DC 20 check

## Rewards

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Recruit Thorgrim? | Yes / No | +5 Survival, shelter knowledge, combat support vs. independence |
| Route through caves? | Through lair / Dwarven shortcut / Over the top | Different encounters, time trade-offs |
| Fight or evade Remorhaz? | Fight / Sneak / Collapse tunnel | XP and loot vs. resources saved vs. path blocked |
| Confront Cryonax? | Attack / Negotiate / Evade | Full rewards vs. partial success vs. dragon survives |
| Take the hoard? | Yes (all/some) / No | Wealth + possible alarm vs. clean escape |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Possible to traverse the entire Dragon's Spine without combat if the party is careful, well-prepared, and rolls well. Requires avoiding Cryonax's hunting times, sneaking through the Ice Caves, and crossing the Peak under cover of a blizzard.
- **Diplomacy:** Cryonax can theoretically be negotiated with. He wants treasure, flattery, and power. Offering significant treasure or convincing him the Imprisoned will betray him could earn passage (DC 25+ Persuasion with advantage from good roleplay/evidence).
- **Brute Force:** Possible but extremely dangerous. Fighting through every obstacle will drain resources severely before the Cryonax encounter.
- **Deception:** The party could disguise themselves as Covenant members (using captured gear) to move more freely, though Cryonax will see through most deception.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- If the party is badly wounded in Act 1-2, Thorgrim can guide them to a hidden cave with a hot spring (full rest opportunity, costs 1 day)
- If Cryonax defeats the party but doesn't kill them, they wake up in his hoard as "entertainment"—escape scenario
- If too much time passes, the adventure continues but [[The Obsidian Gate]] becomes harder (additional traps, reinforced guards)
- Total party kill means the campaign must continue with new characters or a rescue mission

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** The party descends toward the Obsidian Gate. From the mountain's far side, they can see the fortress—a structure of black glass and impossible geometry, crackling with purple lightning. The Covenant's banners fly from its walls. The final stage of the campaign begins.

**If Failed:** If the party turned back or was forced to retreat, the Covenant completes its preparations. The seals weaken further. The party must find another way—perhaps through the Underdark, perhaps with an army at their back.

**If Partial Success:** The party reaches the Obsidian Gate but is wounded, under-equipped, or pursued by a surviving Cryonax. The next adventure begins at a disadvantage.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- If Cryonax dies, the Dragon's Spine becomes (relatively) safe—trade routes may eventually reopen
- The Dwarves of the Sundered Peaks may reclaim the high passes
- The party's legend grows—they crossed the uncrossable
- If Cryonax lives, he becomes a recurring enemy, potentially enhanced further by the Imprisoned

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. Cryonax (if alive) will seek revenge—he never forgets a slight
2. The Imprisoned's ability to corrupt dragons suggests other wyrms may be compromised
3. The dwarven shortcut tunnels connect to deeper passages—what else is down there?

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Cryonax | Dead or wounded/fled | Empowered by the Imprisoned |
| Thorgrim | Honors his brother; becomes ally | Dies in the attempt or blames party |
| Remorhaz Matriarch | Dead | Survives; nest grows |
| Covenant Stragglers | Already dead | Already dead |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Emphasize the environmental hostility—the mountain should feel like an enemy
- Track resources carefully: rations, water, climbing gear, spell slots
- Use exhaustion levels to build tension; the party should feel worn down
- Let Cryonax be terrifying—he's an apex predator who has never lost
- Give players agency: let them plan their route, timing, and approach
- Don't be afraid to let players skip encounters with clever thinking

### Pacing Suggestions
- Day 1: Frosthollow and Glacier crossing (Act 1)
- Day 2: Ice Caves exploration and Remorhaz encounter (Act 2)
- Day 3: Peak of Storms and Cryonax (Act 3)
- Day 4: Descent to Obsidian Gate (transition)
- Build intensity: environmental -> creature -> boss

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to fly over the peaks | Wild magic zones and Cryonax's aerial superiority make this dangerous |
| Use Sending to call for help | Help is 2+ days away; encouragement only |
| Try to collapse the caves on Cryonax | Possible but risks trapping themselves; dragon has multiple exits |
| Hunt Remorhaz for supplies | Their heated bodies can provide warmth; risky but clever |
| Take a long rest in the open | Cryonax finds them; attack during rest |
| Negotiate with Cryonax | He's arrogant; flattery works but he wants something significant |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Reduce Cryonax to Adult White Dragon (CR 13) with minor shadow enhancements
- Remove one Young Remorhaz from the nest encounter
- Provide additional supplies at Frosthollow
- Make environmental saves DC 10 instead of DC 12-15

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add frost giant patrols (allied with Cryonax)
- Include a second Adult Remorhaz
- Make Cryonax fight to the death (no retreat option)
- Add time pressure: storms close in, reducing available time

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- The Obsidian Gate is visible from the far side—describe its wrongness
- The shadow corruption in Cryonax hints at the Imprisoned's power
- Mention that the Covenant's leadership is already inside the fortress
- Plant seeds about "the ritual" being nearly complete

## Secrets

1. **Cryonax's Bargain:** The dragon has been promised transformation into a Void Dragon—immortal, invulnerable to mortal weapons, capable of freezing reality itself. He genuinely believes this and will fight harder to protect the Covenant's mission than he would for mere territory.

2. **The Icevein Tunnels:** The dwarven shortcut connects to the Deep Roads and eventually to [[Ironhold]]. The dwarves have kept this secret for centuries, fearing what might come up from below. Using this route risks attracting attention from things that dwell in the deep dark.

3. **Thorgrim's Brother:** Borin Icepick didn't just die to Cryonax—he was captured alive and is now one of the frozen victims in the dragon's gallery. Thorgrim suspects this but hasn't confirmed it. Finding Borin's body will either break Thorgrim or forge him into a relentless ally.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. **The Grey Keep's Victory:** The siege is broken, but the Covenant escaped into the mountains. Pursuit is the only option.
2. **The Prophet's Trail:** Captured documents reveal the Covenant's destination and the urgency of stopping them.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **Revenge of the White Silence:** If Cryonax survives, he rebuilds his strength and hunts the party across the continent, potentially appearing at the worst possible moment in a future adventure.
2. **The Dwarven Debt:** The dwarves of Frosthollow and Ironhold owe the party for clearing their passes. They offer aid, information about the mountains' secrets, and access to the Deep Roads.
3. **The Void Dragon Prophecy:** Learning of Cryonax's intended transformation raises questions—are other dragons being corrupted? Could the Imprisoned create an army of shadow dragons?

**Prompt:**
> Four adventurers crossing a knife-edge mountain ridge, the path barely two feet wide with thousand-foot drops on either side. Jagged black peaks stretch to the horizon under a sky of churning purple storm clouds. One character reaches back to help another who has slipped. Ice and snow blast horizontally across the scene.

**Prompt:**
> Cryonax, the White Silence, an Ancient White Dragon of terrifying size, rears up on the Peak of Storms. His scales are glacier-blue, frost coating his massive form. His eyes are pools of void-black, leaking shadow. His jaws open to release a torrent of white-blue breath weapon mixed with swirling darkness. Before him, four adventurers brace against the attack—a fighter raising a shield, a wizard preparing a fire spell, a rogue diving for cover, a cleric calling on divine light. Purple lightning strikes the stone pillars around them. The wind howls. Ice and shadow merge in the dragon's terrible presence.

## Notes
- This is a "Level 8-9" adventure—characters should start at 8 and reach 9 during or after
- The Dragon fight is optional but extremely rewarding; evading Cryonax is a valid victory
- Emphasize exhaustion and resource depletion; this should feel like a war of attrition against the mountain
- Cryonax is CR 20—this is meant to be terrifying. The party should feel like underdogs.
- The environmental hazards are as deadly as the monsters; don't pull punches on Constitution saves
- If the party kills Cryonax, it's a major campaign achievement—celebrate it appropriately
