# Riverboat to Highwall

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A roleplay-heavy interlude adventure bridging [[Ruins of the Dawn]] and [[The Traitors Masquerade]]. The party travels aboard a luxury riverboat to reach [[Highwall]] in time for the Masquerade Ball. During the journey, a murder occurs, and the party must identify the killer among the passengers before the boat docks. This adventure emphasizes investigation, social interaction, and deduction, with combat as a climactic confrontation rather than a series of encounters.

## Overview

Following their victory at the [[Ruins of the Dawn]], the party carries damning evidence against [[Lord Valerius]] and must reach [[Highwall]] before the Masquerade Ball. The fastest route is aboard **The Gilded Swan**, a luxury riverboat traveling down the Swiftwater River through [[The Greenfields]]. During the night, a fellow passenger is found dead in his locked cabin—**Inspector Hark**, a Crown investigator secretly carrying additional evidence against the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]. The killer is **Madame Vane**, an elderly noblewoman who is actually a Covenant assassin dispatched to silence Hark. The party must solve the murder and recover the Inspector's documents before the boat reaches port, or the evidence dies with him.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Investigation / Murder Mystery

**Tone:** Noir / Suspense / Tense

**Themes:**
- Trust and deception
- Justice versus expediency
- Enemies hiding in plain sight

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** One-Shot (3-4 hours)

**Party Level:** 3

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate

**Combat Frequency:** Low (One significant encounter)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Very High

**Exploration Emphasis:** Low (confined to the riverboat)

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party books passage on The Gilded Swan, the fastest vessel traveling down the Swiftwater River to [[Highwall]]. The first evening passes pleasantly enough, but the next morning, screams echo through the passenger deck. A body has been discovered. Captain Orivan approaches the party—he's heard they're capable adventurers and needs help maintaining order while investigating.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** Captain Orivan Blackwater
**Motivation:** Maintain the safety and reputation of his vessel; avoid scandal that would ruin his business
**What They Offer:** Free passage, a private cabin, and his eternal gratitude; if the party solves the case discreetly, he'll provide useful contacts in Highwall's merchant district

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- A passenger named **Inspector Hark** was found dead in his cabin this morning
- The cabin was locked from the inside with no signs of forced entry
- The ship carries twelve passengers and fifteen crew members
- The boat will reach Highwall in approximately six hours
- Captain Orivan wants this handled quietly to avoid panic

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate (the boat docks in six hours)

**Consequences of Delay:** If the murderer is not identified before docking, they will slip away into the city. The Inspector's evidence will be lost, and the Covenant will have won this round. Additionally, Captain Orivan may face legal consequences for arriving with an unsolved murder.

## Background

### The Situation
Inspector Hark of the Crown's Justice was secretly investigating [[Lord Valerius]]'s connection to the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]. He had assembled a dossier proving Valerius's involvement in artifact smuggling, including shipping manifests, witness testimonies, and a partial list of Covenant operatives in [[Highwall]]. The Covenant learned of his mission and dispatched **Madame Vane**—an elderly noblewoman persona concealing one of their deadliest assassins—to eliminate him and recover the evidence. She poisoned him through his evening tea using a slow-acting toxin derived from shadowroot, then retrieved most of his documents. However, she couldn't find the most damning piece: a sealed letter naming Valerius directly, which Hark had hidden in the false bottom of his traveling chest.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- **Three weeks ago:** Inspector Hark began his investigation after receiving an anonymous tip about Valerius
- **One week ago:** Hark assembled enough evidence to warrant Valerius's arrest and booked passage to Highwall
- **Three days ago:** The Covenant intercepted word of Hark's journey and dispatched Madame Vane
- **Yesterday evening:** Madame Vane posed as a friendly elderly woman and shared tea with Hark in the salon; she slipped poison into his cup
- **Last night:** Hark felt ill and retired early; the poison stopped his heart around midnight
- **This morning:** A steward discovered the body when bringing morning tea

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Madame Vane]] | Escape suspicion and reach Highwall to report success | Maintain her harmless elderly persona, deflect suspicion onto others |
| **Captain Orivan** | Solve the murder quietly and protect his reputation | Cooperate with investigators, control information |
| **Merchant Aldric** | Avoid scrutiny of his smuggled wine | Act nervous and evasive, drawing suspicion |
| **Silas the Bard** | Document the mystery for a future ballad | Ask too many questions, potentially help or hinder |
| **Inspector Hark** (deceased) | Expose Valerius and the Covenant | His hidden evidence can still accomplish this posthumously |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:**
- They recover Hark's evidence, gaining additional ammunition against Valerius for the Masquerade
- They eliminate a dangerous Covenant operative
- They gain Captain Orivan as an ally with connections in Highwall
- The party arrives at the capital with momentum and advantage

**If the party fails:**
- Madame Vane escapes to warn the Covenant that Hark's investigation may have touched others
- The evidence is lost (or the party keeps theirs without the reinforcement Hark's documents would provide)
- Valerius may be warned that investigators are coming
- The Masquerade becomes significantly harder

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Identify Inspector Hark's murderer before The Gilded Swan docks at Highwall.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Recover Inspector Hark's hidden evidence against Lord Valerius
2. Learn why Hark was targeted (connecting the murder to the larger Covenant conspiracy)
3. Apprehend the murderer alive for questioning
4. Complete the investigation without causing a panic among passengers

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Protect Silas the Bard, who has inadvertently overheard too much and may be Vane's next target
2. Discover that Merchant Aldric's smuggling operation has connections to [[The Black Lotus]]

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The murderer is correctly identified (Madame Vane)
- The party recovers the hidden evidence OR prevents Vane from destroying it

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- The boat docks with the murderer unidentified
- Madame Vane eliminates another witness (Silas) and escapes
- The party accuses the wrong person and Vane uses the confusion to escape

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Body
**Goal:** Establish the murder and begin gathering evidence.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Discovery:** The party is summoned to Hark's cabin. They find him dead in his bunk, door locked from inside, no obvious wounds. A cold cup of tea sits on the nightstand.
2. **The Crime Scene:** Investigation reveals the tea was poisoned (Medicine DC 12 or Poisoner's Kit), the window is latched but shows faint scratches (Investigation DC 15), and personal effects have been searched (Perception DC 10).
3. **The Captain's Briefing:** Orivan provides the passenger manifest and asks for discretion. He mentions Hark kept to himself but was seen talking with "the kind old grandmother" yesterday.

**Information to Reveal:**
- Hark was poisoned, not killed by violence
- Someone searched his belongings before discovery
- The locked-room mystery has a solution (the window latch)

**Transition to Act 2:** The party must interview the suspects to identify who had means, motive, and opportunity.

### Act 2: The Interrogations
**Goal:** Interview suspects, gather clues, and narrow down the killer.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Nervous Merchant (Aldric):** A sweating, evasive man who clearly has something to hide. He claims he was in his cabin all night. His secret: he's smuggling untaxed Greenfield wine in his luggage. Red herring, but his nervousness makes him suspicious.
2. **The Curious Bard (Silas):** A flamboyant entertainer who was awake late, composing in the salon. He noticed Madame Vane walking the deck around midnight—"taking air for her joints," she claimed. He also heard Hark's door click around that time. Key witness.
3. **The Charming Grandmother (Madame Vane):** A frail-seeming elderly woman traveling to visit her "grandchildren" in Highwall. She admits to sharing tea with Hark yesterday—"such a nice young man"—but feigns shock at his death. She's unnaturally observant (Insight DC 16 notices her eyes don't match her persona).
4. **The Crew Interviews:** Stewards confirm delivering Hark's tea to his cabin yesterday (he always took it in his room). One mentions Madame Vane asking about passenger accommodations—"just making conversation."

**Rising Tension:**
- If the party focuses too much on Aldric, Vane plants evidence in his cabin (a vial of poison)
- If the party questions Vane too aggressively, she begins considering eliminating Silas as a loose end
- The clock is ticking—distant views of Highwall's towers become visible

**Midpoint Twist:**
The party discovers Inspector Hark's hidden pocket in his traveling chest, containing a sealed letter marked "FOR THE KING'S EYES ONLY—Evidence Against Lord V." This reveals Hark was no ordinary passenger and raises the stakes dramatically. However, the letter is incomplete without the corroborating documents Vane already stole.

**Transition to Act 3:** The party must confront their prime suspect before the boat docks.

### Act 3: The Unmasking
**Goal:** Confront Madame Vane and recover the stolen evidence.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Confrontation:** When accused or cornered, Vane drops her grandmother act. Her posture changes; her voice becomes cold. She may attempt to negotiate ("We could both benefit from Valerius's fall—give me passage and I'll tell you everything").
2. **The Chase/Fight:** If combat occurs, Vane fights to escape, not to kill (unless cornered). She'll try to reach the deck and jump overboard to swim to shore, or take a hostage.

**Climactic Encounter:**
Vane reveals her true capabilities as a trained Covenant assassin. She fights with poisoned needles, acrobatic grace, and dirty tricks. The confined ship environment creates interesting tactical challenges—narrow corridors, bystanders, the risk of falling overboard.

**Resolution Options:**
- **Capture:** Vane is subdued and bound. She can be interrogated (she knows some Covenant operations but not the big picture) and turned over to authorities in Highwall.
- **Death:** Vane is killed in combat. Her belongings contain Hark's stolen documents and a coded message referencing "the Silver Mask" (Valerius).
- **Escape:** Vane jumps overboard and swims to shore. The party loses intelligence but may find her documents in her cabin.
- **Negotiation:** If the party agrees to let Vane escape, she reveals Valerius's role and warns that "bigger things are in motion than one noble's downfall." (Morally complicated but provides information)

## Locations

### Overview Map
The Gilded Swan is a three-deck riverboat approximately 120 feet long. The adventure takes place entirely aboard the vessel as it travels down the Swiftwater River through the Greenfields toward Highwall.

### Primary Location
**Name:** The Gilded Swan (Main Deck)

**Description:** The main deck features the grand salon, dining area, and passenger cabins. Polished oak panels line the walls, brass fixtures gleam, and large windows offer views of the passing countryside. Lanterns provide warm lighting, and the gentle rock of the boat creates a constant subtle motion.

**Key Features:**
- Grand Salon: Central gathering space with couches, a small stage, and a bar
- Passenger Cabins: Eight private rooms along a narrow corridor, each with a bunk, writing desk, and porthole window
- Dining Area: Long table for communal meals, adjacent to the small galley

**Encounters Here:** Most interrogations occur in the salon; the crime scene is Hark's cabin; the climax may occur in the corridor or salon.

### Location 2: Upper Deck
**Description:** The open-air upper deck features seating areas where passengers can enjoy the view. A canvas awning provides shade during the day. At night, it's lit only by lanterns and moonlight.

**Key Features:**
- Observation Area: Chairs and small tables for scenic viewing
- Pilot House: Where Captain Orivan and his helmsman operate the vessel
- Cargo Crane: For loading supplies at ports

**Encounters Here:** Vane's midnight walk was observed from here; potential chase scene location; possible escape point for Vane.

### Location 3: Lower Deck (Hold)
**Description:** The cargo hold and crew quarters occupy the lower deck. It's darker here, lit by fewer lanterns, with the constant sound of the river against the hull. Storage crates and passenger luggage fill most of the space.

**Key Features:**
- Cargo Hold: Contains passenger luggage, trade goods, and Aldric's smuggled wine
- Crew Quarters: Cramped bunks for the fifteen crew members
- Engine Room: The magical/mechanical system that propels the boat (or oar banks/sail rigging if non-magical)

**Encounters Here:** Search for hidden evidence; potential ambush location; Aldric's contraband can be discovered.

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Oakhaven Docks | Highwall Harbor | ~80 miles | River rapids (avoided by captain), potential pirate activity (not relevant to this adventure) |
| Main Deck | Upper Deck | Stairs (one round) | Slippery in rain |
| Main Deck | Lower Deck | Ladder (one round) | Narrow, difficult to navigate in combat |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### Captain Orivan Blackwater
**Role:** Quest giver and ally

**Description:** A weathered human man in his fifties with a close-cropped grey beard and keen blue eyes. He wears a spotless captain's coat despite the practical nature of his work. His hands are calloused from years of river work, but his manner suggests education and refinement.

**Personality:** Professional, courteous, deeply concerned with reputation, genuinely wants justice but prioritizes his vessel and passengers' safety.

**What They Want:** The murder solved quietly and efficiently before docking; no scandal, no panic, no damage to his business.

**What They Know:** Passenger backgrounds (basic), crew alibis, ship layout, that Hark was a Crown official traveling on business.

**How They Can Help:** Provides access to all areas of the ship, can order crew to assist, offers private space for interrogations, can delay arrival by a few hours if convinced it's necessary.

#### Silas Songweaver
**Role:** Key witness and potential victim

**Description:** A young half-elf bard with wild auburn hair, mismatched traveling clothes that somehow work together, and an ever-present lute. His eyes are bright with curiosity and mischief.

**Personality:** Flamboyant, curious, talks too much, genuinely helpful but can't resist a good story. His curiosity may endanger him.

**What They Want:** A great tale to tell; the truth about the mystery; adventure.

**What They Know:** Saw Madame Vane on deck at midnight; heard Hark's door click; noticed Vane watching other passengers throughout the voyage.

**How They Can Help:** Provides crucial testimony placing Vane near the scene; can distract or charm NPCs; may inadvertently reveal the party's investigation to Vane if not warned to stay quiet.

### Neutrals

#### Merchant Aldric Thornbury
**Role:** Red herring suspect

**Description:** A portly human merchant in his forties with thinning brown hair and an unfortunate tendency to sweat when nervous. His clothes are expensive but rumpled, and he constantly fidgets with a gold ring.

**Personality:** Nervous, evasive, defensive; not a bad man, just a small-time smuggler caught in a bad situation.

**What They Want:** To reach Highwall without anyone examining his luggage too closely.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Initially suspicious and unhelpful; if the party discovers his smuggling but agrees to overlook it, he becomes cooperative and reveals everything he observed.

#### Lady Corrine Ashford
**Role:** Aristocratic passenger

**Description:** An actual elderly noblewoman (unlike Vane's disguise) traveling with her maid. She's imperious, easily offended, and makes frequent complaints about the accommodations.

**Personality:** Haughty, observant, surprisingly sharp beneath the complaints.

**What They Want:** To reach Highwall for her nephew's wedding; to be treated with the respect her station deserves.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Initially dismissive; if treated with appropriate deference, reveals she thought Madame Vane's "grandmother act" was rather overdone ("No woman of quality would behave so...saccharine").

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: Madame Vane
**Role:** The murderer / Covenant assassin

**Description:** In her guise as Madame Vane, she appears to be a kindly woman in her late sixties with silver hair in a neat bun, warm brown eyes, and a gentle smile. She wears simple but well-made traveling clothes in muted colors. She walks with a slight limp and carries a cane. In reality, she is a Covenant assassin in her forties, her true appearance concealed by a Hat of Disguise (or masterful mundane disguise). Beneath the illusion, she has sharp features, cold grey eyes, and the lean build of a predator.

**Personality:** The grandmother persona is warm, curious, and chatty. The true Vane is cold, professional, and utterly pragmatic. She kills without malice or pleasure—it's simply work. She respects competence and may genuinely compliment the party if they see through her disguise.

**Motivation:** Complete her mission for the Covenant; survive and escape; she believes in the Covenant's cause but is not a fanatic—survival takes priority over martyrdom.

**Methods:** Poison (her specialty), misdirection, manipulation, framing others, and when cornered, precise violence. She avoids direct combat when possible.

**Weakness:** Her disguise, while excellent, has tells (her eyes are too sharp for a grandmother; her "arthritic" hands are too steady; her cane has no weight-bearing wear). She underestimates "common adventurers." She's operating alone without backup.

**Combat Notes:**
- Use **Assassin** stat block (MM p.343), adjusted for level 3 party if needed
- Alternatively, use **Spy** stat block with added poison abilities
- Key abilities: Sneak Attack, Poison Use, expertise in Deception and Stealth
- Tactics: Strike from surprise, use environment, take hostages, flee rather than die

#### Secondary Antagonist: (None present)
**Note:** The Covenant itself is the secondary antagonist, represented by Vane. Lord Valerius's shadow looms over the adventure but he does not appear.

**Connection to Primary:** Vane was dispatched by Covenant leadership to protect Valerius's identity and operations.

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: Vane Cornered
**Location:** Passenger corridor or Grand Salon

**Trigger:** The party publicly accuses Vane or attempts to restrain her

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Madame Vane (Spy/Assassin) | 1 | See stat block modifications below |

**Tactics:** Vane's first priority is escape, not combat. She throws a smoke bomb (heavily obscured, 10-foot radius), uses a hostage if available (closest passenger or Silas), and fights defensively while moving toward the deck. If she reaches the upper deck, she dives overboard and attempts to swim to shore.

**Difficulty:** Medium (Hard if Vane achieves surprise or takes a hostage)

**Terrain Features:**
- Narrow corridor: 5 feet wide, difficult to flank
- Breakable lanterns: Can be shattered to create fire hazards or darkness
- Passenger doors: Bystanders may open doors at inopportune moments
- Cabin furniture: Tables, chairs can provide half cover or be thrown

**Rewards:** Vane's equipment, stolen documents if she's stopped before escaping.

#### Encounter 2: (Optional) Deck Chase
**Location:** Main Deck to Upper Deck

**Trigger:** Vane flees toward the upper deck to escape overboard

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Madame Vane (fleeing) | 1 | Uses Dash and Disengage actions |

**Tactics:** This is a chase rather than a fight. Vane uses Dash and attempts to reach the railing. She may throw caltrops, push obstacles in the party's path, or feint attacks to create openings. If caught, she fights.

**Difficulty:** Easy (the goal is to stop her, not kill her)

**Rewards:** If caught before going overboard, full recovery of stolen items and possibility of interrogation.

#### Boss Encounter: Vane's Last Stand
**Location:** Upper Deck, near the railing

**Setup:** If cornered with no escape route, or if the party threatens something she cares about (the mission's completion, her own life with no quarter offered), Vane fights to kill.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Madame Vane (Assassin) | 1 | Full capabilities |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 (Above 50% HP):** Vane uses poisoned needles at range (dart attacks with additional poison damage), maintains distance, uses Cunning Action to Disengage/Hide.
2. **Phase 2 (Below 50% HP):** Vane closes to melee with a hidden shortsword, uses Sneak Attack aggressively, may attempt a final suicide gambit if death is certain (destroy the documents, take someone with her).

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:** None (single-session adventure, keep it simple).

**Victory Conditions:** Vane killed or incapacitated; alternatively, Vane escapes but documents are recovered.

**Rewards:**
- Vane's equipment: Hat of Disguise (or disguise kit), 5 doses of shadowroot poison, 50 gp, coded Covenant instructions
- Hark's stolen documents (if recovered)
- Interrogation opportunity if captured alive

### Social Encounters

#### The Interrogations
**Location:** Grand Salon, individual cabins

**NPCs Present:** Rotating based on who the party interviews; Captain Orivan may observe

**Stakes:** Correctly identifying the murderer versus accusing an innocent person

**Information Available:**
- Each NPC has something to hide (not necessarily relevant to the murder)
- Each NPC observed something potentially useful
- The truth points consistently toward Vane

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Insight (Vane) | 16 | Notice her eyes don't match her demeanor | Vane seems genuinely sweet |
| Insight (Aldric) | 10 | Realize he's hiding something unrelated | Assume his nervousness means guilt |
| Persuasion (Lady Ashford) | 14 | She shares her suspicions about Vane | She refuses to gossip with commoners |
| Intimidation (Any) | 12 | NPC reveals their secret quickly | NPC becomes hostile, other passengers notice |
| Deception (to Vane) | 14 | Convince her you suspect someone else | Vane realizes you're onto her and prepares |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Party identifies Vane through clever questioning without alerting her, allowing them to set an ambush
- Moderate: Party correctly identifies Vane but she knows she's suspected, leading to confrontation
- Worst: Party accuses the wrong person (Aldric), creating chaos that Vane uses to escape

### Exploration Challenges

#### Searching Hark's Cabin
**Location:** Inspector Hark's cabin (crime scene)

**Description:** A small but well-appointed cabin with a bunk, writing desk, porthole window, and traveling chest. Hark's body has been covered but not moved. A cold cup of tea sits on the nightstand.

**Skills Useful:**
- Investigation: Search the cabin thoroughly
- Medicine: Examine the body and tea
- Perception: Notice small details
- Thieves' Tools: Open the locked chest properly

**Hazards:** None physical; the hazard is missing crucial evidence.

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
| Check | DC | Discovery |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| Medicine (tea) | 12 | Poisoned with shadowroot; bitter smell masked by strong tea |
| Medicine (body) | 14 | Death occurred approximately midnight; no defensive wounds |
| Investigation (window) | 15 | Faint scratches on the latch from a thin tool; someone relocked it from outside |
| Investigation (chest) | 13 | False bottom (Thieves' Tools DC 10 to open without damage) |
| Perception (desk) | 12 | Faint impressions on blank paper—Hark wrote a letter recently |
| Investigation (room general) | 10 | Someone searched here before; drawers not quite aligned, papers slightly disturbed |

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Hark was poisoned | His cabin | Medicine check on tea | Looking for who had access to his tea |
| Vane shared tea with Hark yesterday | Interview witnesses | Captain Orivan or salon steward | Vane had means |
| Vane was seen near Hark's cabin at midnight | Silas interview | Silas's testimony | Vane had opportunity |
| Window was relocked from outside | Hark's cabin | Investigation check | Understanding the locked-room mystery |
| Hark was a Crown investigator | His documents | Reading papers, hidden letter | Understanding motive (Covenant connection) |
| Vane's disguise has tells | Observation, Lady Ashford | High Insight, social questioning | Confirming Vane is not what she seems |
| Vane has hidden items | Her cabin | Search (DC 15) | Stolen documents, poison vials, coded orders |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. **Aldric's Smuggling:** His nervous behavior and evasiveness make him an obvious suspect, but he's only smuggling untaxed wine. If accused, he breaks down and confesses to smuggling, providing an alibi (he was rearranging his cargo in the hold during the murder window).
2. **The "Mysterious Letter":** Hark received a letter before boarding that seemed to upset him. It was actually from his wife, asking when he'd return home. Emotional, not conspiratorial.
3. **Crew Member Grudge:** A steward had a heated exchange with Hark over a spilled drink. The steward was angry but has a solid alibi (on duty at the pilot house all night, confirmed by Captain Orivan).

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** Madame Vane, the sweet grandmother, is actually a Covenant assassin.

**When It's Revealed:** This can happen through:
- Catching inconsistencies in her story
- Finding the stolen documents in her cabin
- Lady Ashford's observation about her "overdone" act
- A very high Insight roll (DC 18) revealing her "grandmother hands" have no tremor and her eyes track movement like a predator

**Impact:** The revelation reframes everything the party thought they knew about her. Her kindness was manipulation; her frailty was cover. The Covenant's reach extends further than expected—they had an assassin ready to deploy at short notice.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Poison needle (Vane's cane) | Vane's possession | Attempting to grab the cane | Spring-loaded needle coated in shadowroot poison | DEX 13 to avoid | 1 piercing + DC 13 CON or 2d6 poison |
| Smoke bomb (Vane's escape) | Vane's sleeve | Vane throws it as action | 10-foot radius heavily obscured for 1 minute | N/A | No damage; area denial |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Narrow corridors | Below decks | Difficult terrain for Medium+ creatures side by side | Single file or accept disadvantage |
| Slippery deck (if raining) | Upper deck | DEX DC 10 or fall prone when Dashing | Move at normal speed |
| River current | Overboard | STR DC 12 Athletics to swim; 30 feet toward Highwall per round | Don't fall overboard; rope |
| Bystanders | Any public area | Civilians may get in the way, take damage, or panic | Clear the area before combat |

### Puzzles

#### The Locked-Room Mystery
**Location:** Inspector Hark's cabin

**Description:** Hark was found dead in a room locked from the inside. The door has a sliding bolt that can only be operated from within. How did the killer escape?

**Solution:** The killer exited through the porthole window (small but passable for a slim person), then used a thin tool inserted through the gap to manipulate the interior latch, relocking the window from outside. Evidence: scratches on the window latch consistent with a thin metal tool.

**Hints:**
- The window shows faint scratches (Investigation DC 15)
- A thin tool (like a needle or lockpick) could fit through the gap
- Vane carries several thin metal implements disguised as hairpins

**Bypass Options:** The party doesn't need to solve this puzzle to identify Vane, but solving it proves premeditation and eliminates theories about suicide or natural causes.

## Rewards

### Treasure

#### Monetary
**Total Value:** ~150 gp in coins and items

**Distribution:**
| Location | Contents | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Vane's purse | Gold coins | 50 gp |
| Vane's hidden pocket | Gems (payment for the job) | 75 gp |
| Inspector Hark's chest | Personal funds | 25 gp |

#### Magic Items
| Item | Location | Guarded By |
|------|----------|------------|
| Hat of Disguise | Worn by Vane | Vane |
| Potion of Healing | Hark's belongings | N/A (already dead) |
| 5 doses of shadowroot poison | Vane's hidden vials | Vane |

### Quest Rewards
**From Quest Giver:**
Captain Orivan offers:
- Free passage to Highwall (already provided, but no charge is taken)
- A letter of introduction to the Merchant's Guild of Highwall
- 50 gp bonus for "discreet resolution"
- Future passage on The Gilded Swan at half price

**Additional Rewards:**
- If Aldric's smuggling is overlooked, he owes the party a favor (can provide black market contacts in Highwall)
- Silas composes a ballad about the party ("The Sleuths of the Gilded Swan") that may enhance their reputation

### Experience
**Combat XP:** 200 XP for defeating Vane (Assassin CR 2, adjusted)

**Non-Combat XP:** 300 XP for solving the mystery (investigation milestone)

**Milestone Advancement:** This interlude does not grant a level (party should still be level 3), but completion counts toward the Act 1 milestone of reaching level 4.

### Intangible Rewards
- **Reputation:** Word spreads that the party solved a murder on the riverboat; +1 to social checks in Highwall for the next adventure
- **Allies Gained:** Captain Orivan (transportation), Silas (information, entertainment contacts)
- **Information Learned:** The Covenant has operational assassins deployed in the field; Valerius's exposure is important enough to kill for; Hark's evidence corroborates the party's own findings
- **Story Hooks:** Vane's coded orders mention "the Silver Mask" (Valerius) and reference "the Masquerade"—the party now knows the ball is significant to the Covenant

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Who to interview first? | Aldric (obvious suspect), Vane (witness), Silas (bystander), Lady Ashford (noble) | Order affects what information is available and whether Vane has time to prepare |
| How to handle Aldric's smuggling? | Report it, overlook it, blackmail him | Reporting wastes time and antagonizes him; overlooking gains an ally; blackmail provides leverage |
| Confront Vane publicly or privately? | Public (salon), private (her cabin), ambush | Public risks hostages but has witnesses; private is more dangerous; ambush has highest chance of capture |
| Kill or capture Vane? | Lethal force, non-lethal, let her escape for information | Killing ends the threat but loses intelligence; capture provides interrogation; escape may provide info but is risky |
| What to do with Hark's evidence? | Keep it, turn it over to authorities, destroy it | Keeping it strengthens the Masquerade mission; turning it over may involve authorities; destroying it (why?!) fails the secondary objective |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Sneak into Vane's cabin while she's elsewhere to find evidence without confrontation
- **Diplomacy:** Convince Vane that cooperation benefits her (she's a professional, not a fanatic)
- **Brute Force:** Confront Vane immediately based on suspicion and force a confession through intimidation
- **Deception:** Pretend to be Covenant agents to trick Vane into revealing herself

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- **Wrong accusation:** If the party falsely accuses Aldric, Vane uses the chaos to slip away. The adventure can continue with the party realizing their error and pursuing her into Highwall (extended chase).
- **Vane escapes:** If Vane escapes overboard, the party loses the intelligence but keeps Hark's hidden letter. The Masquerade becomes harder, but not impossible.
- **Time runs out:** If the boat docks with no resolution, local authorities take over. The party can provide their suspicions, and Vane may be caught later (off-screen), but they gain no rewards and the evidence may be compromised in the bureaucratic process.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:**
The party arrives at Highwall with both their evidence from the Ruins and Hark's corroborating documents. Captain Orivan smooths their arrival with the harbor master. The authorities are satisfied that the murder is solved (or informed if Vane is handed over). The party has several hours before the Masquerade to prepare, and they now know the Covenant considers this event significant.

**If Failed:**
The party arrives at Highwall under a cloud. If Vane escaped, they may be questioned about the unresolved murder. Their evidence is weaker without Hark's documents, and they've lost the element of surprise—Vane may have warned her handlers that investigators are coming.

**If Partial Success:**
The party solved the murder but Vane escaped, or vice versa. They have some advantages but not all.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- If Vane was captured and interrogated, she reveals operational details that could be useful in future Covenant encounters
- If Vane was killed, the Covenant marks the party as genuine threats—they've now eliminated two of their operatives (Captain Varrick's team and Vane)
- Inspector Hark's death creates a vacancy in the Crown's Justice; someone may seek to fill it (potential future ally or enemy)

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. Who tipped off the Covenant about Inspector Hark's journey? There's a leak somewhere in the Crown's Justice or at Hark's origin point.
2. Aldric's smuggling operation connects to [[The Black Lotus]]—what else are they moving through the Greenfields?

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Madame Vane | Captured/killed; removed as threat | Escapes to warn Covenant; may reappear as recurring enemy |
| Captain Orivan | Grateful ally; provides ongoing transport help | Tarnished reputation; may blame party for bungling the investigation |
| Silas the Bard | Writes flattering ballad; becomes information contact in Highwall | If Vane escaped after being questioned, may be targeted later |
| Merchant Aldric | Nervous but grateful if protected; future contact | Arrested if his smuggling was revealed; hostile |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- **Maintain tension through time:** Regularly describe the passing scenery—farmland giving way to the walls of Highwall on the horizon, then the city's spires becoming distinct. This creates urgency without a strict countdown.
- **Make Vane's persona convincing:** Before the reveal, she should seem genuinely sweet. Don't oversell it—let the party's suspicions grow naturally.
- **Prepare NPC voices:** Each suspect should be distinct in mannerism and speech pattern.
- **Allow creative solutions:** If the party comes up with a clever approach not covered here, reward it.
- **The locked-room mystery is optional:** Not all groups enjoy puzzles. If the party struggles, have Silas mention he heard the window squeak that night.

### Pacing Suggestions
- **First 30 minutes:** Discovery, crime scene investigation, initial NPC introductions
- **Next 60-90 minutes:** Interrogations, clue-gathering, putting pieces together
- **Final 30-45 minutes:** Confrontation, climax, resolution
- Adjust based on group engagement—if they're having fun with interrogations, let them run; if they're stuck, have an NPC offer a clue

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Search Vane's cabin immediately | She's there (she rarely leaves it); must explain their presence or return later |
| Try to contact authorities via magic | No authorities on the boat; magic might reach shore but help won't arrive before docking |
| Cast Zone of Truth | Vane automatically fails (she's aware of the spell) and simply refuses to speak, arousing suspicion |
| Accuse Vane without solid evidence | She acts deeply wounded and other passengers may turn against the party; she plans to eliminate Silas and frame Aldric |
| Try to delay the boat | Captain Orivan agrees to slow down for 2 hours maximum; longer requires compelling reason |
| Attempt to seize and search all passengers | Creates chaos, passenger rebellion, and lets Vane dispose of evidence or escape in confusion |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Reduce Vane to Spy stats (CR 1)
- Remove the smoke bomb or reduce poison damage
- Have Silas more directly implicate Vane ("I saw her coming from Hark's direction, now that I think of it...")

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Use full Assassin stats for Vane
- Add a junior Covenant agent disguised as a steward who aids Vane's escape
- Require more evidence to convict (the party must find the documents AND prove the locked-room solution)

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- Hark's documents mention the Masquerade specifically—the Covenant knew about it
- Vane, if interrogated, mentions "the Silver Mask" as her handler's title (this is Valerius)
- A coded note in Vane's belongings references "Project Corruption" in the Whisperwood (foreshadowing Act 2)

## Secrets

1. **Inspector Hark was actually investigating more than just Valerius.** His full dossier (which Vane destroyed) contained evidence of Covenant infiltration in three noble houses, the Arcane Synod, and the Crown's Justice itself. The party only recovers the Valerius portion.

2. **Madame Vane is not her real name or her only identity.** She has operated under a dozen aliases across the continent. If captured and her true face seen, there's a chance (10%) a party member recognizes her from a wanted poster or past encounter under a different name.

3. **The Covenant dispatched two assassins, not one.** The second, a young man posing as a deckhand, lost his nerve when Vane completed the mission cleanly and is hiding among the crew. He will not act unless discovered, and he knows very little—but his existence suggests the Covenant takes no chances.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. **The Ruins Victory:** The party has just secured the Dawn Key and evidence against Valerius from the [[Ruins of the Dawn]]. They need fast transport to Highwall before the Masquerade.
2. **Time Pressure:** Lady Kaelen of the [[Grey Wardens]] has sent word that the Masquerade happens in two days. The Gilded Swan is the fastest option.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **The Masquerade:** The party's next adventure ([[The Traitors Masquerade]]) is directly set up. They arrive in Highwall with evidence, contacts, and knowledge of Covenant interest in the event.
2. **The Leak Hunt:** Who told the Covenant about Hark? A future investigation could trace the intelligence failure to a corrupt official.
3. **The Black Lotus Connection:** Aldric's smuggling operation connects to larger criminal networks. The party may need those contacts later—or have to deal with them as enemies.

## Notes

- This adventure is designed as a palette cleanser between the dungeon-crawl of Ruins of the Dawn and the social intrigue of The Traitor's Masquerade
- The confined setting encourages creative problem-solving and intensive roleplay
- Murder mystery adventures can frustrate players who feel stuck—prepare hints through NPC observations and allow creative interrogation techniques
- Madame Vane works best as a memorable villain who feels genuinely threatening despite being a single enemy; her competence and cold professionalism contrast with the cultists the party has faced before
- The evidence recovered here should feel significant—it should provide tangible advantages in the next adventure, such as advantage on certain social checks or access to otherwise unavailable information
- Consider having a printed passenger list for players to take notes on during the investigation
