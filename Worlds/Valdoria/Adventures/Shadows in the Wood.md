# Shadows in the Wood

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
Based on intelligence recovered from Valerius's ledger, the party enters the ancient [[The Whisperwood|Whisperwood]] to investigate reports of unnatural corruption spreading from its heart. A fallen druid circle called the **Circle of Rot**—corrupted servants of [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]—has been poisoning the forest's ley lines to channel dark energy toward the seals binding [[The Shackled God]]. The party must navigate a dying forest turned hostile, cleanse three corrupted Ley Nodes before the corruption becomes irreversible, rescue the last unicorn of the Whisperwood from ritual sacrifice, and ultimately confront Malakor the Blighted at the Heart Tree before the entire forest falls to shadow.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Wilderness Exploration / Environmental Horror / Boss Rush

**Tone:** Dark Fantasy / Environmental Horror / Survival

**Themes:**
- Nature corrupted and perverted from within
- The price of falling to dark temptation
- Desperate survival against overwhelming decay
- Hope preserved in small acts of restoration

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 3 Sessions

**Party Level:** 5

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Hard (Environmental hazards compound combat)

**Combat Frequency:** High

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Moderate (Lirael, the dying forest, moral choices)

**Exploration Emphasis:** High (Navigating corrupted terrain, finding Ley Nodes)

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party arrives at [[Oakhaven]] following leads from their investigation into the Covenant. At the village edge, they find a dryad collapsed against a fence post—her bark cracked and weeping black sap, her leaf-hair withered to brown. She is Lirael, guardian spirit of the Whisperwood's eastern reaches, and she has crawled for three days to reach help. With her dying breath, she begs the party to save "the Heart Tree" before collapsing into unconsciousness.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Lirael]], Dryad of the Eastern Grove
**Motivation:** Save her home, her people, and the unicorn she has protected for centuries
**What They Offer:** Her guidance through the corrupted forest, knowledge of safe paths, and the promise that the forest itself will remember their service

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The forest is "sick"—animals have turned rabid, trees weep black ichor, and the very ground squelches with corruption
- A black sludge flows through streams that once ran crystal clear
- The [[The Grey Wardens|Grey Wardens]] have lost contact with patrols in the deep forest
- Something is happening at "the Ley Nodes"—places of power that Lirael describes as "the forest's veins"
- A group of druids calling themselves the Circle of Rot have turned against nature itself

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Critical

**Consequences of Delay:** Every day the party delays, the corruption spreads further. After three days, the third Ley Node falls permanently, and the unicorn is sacrificed. After five days, the Heart Tree dies, and the entire Whisperwood begins its transformation into a nightmare forest that will threaten all surrounding lands.

## Background

### The Situation
Six months ago, a druid named Malakor was approached by agents of [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] who promised him the secret of "true rebirth"—a way to transcend the cycle of death and decay that all druids witness in nature. Already bitter from watching his grove destroyed by logging interests and his pleas to [[The Grey Wardens]] go unanswered, Malakor accepted. What he received was shadow magic that twisted his connection to nature into something profane. Now styling himself "Malakor the Blighted," he leads a circle of corrupted druids in a ritual to poison the forest's three Ley Nodes—focal points of primal energy. The corruption he channels feeds through the earth toward the Seal-Point beneath the Whisperwood, weakening the ancient bindings that [[The Grey Wardens]] unknowingly guard. Two nodes have already fallen. If the third falls and the Heart Tree is corrupted, the damage may be irreversible.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- Six months ago: Malakor falls to Covenant influence after his grove is destroyed
- Four months ago: Malakor recruits other bitter druids, forming the Circle of Rot
- Two months ago: The First Ley Node falls, beginning the corruption's spread
- One month ago: The Second Ley Node falls; animals begin turning rabid
- Two weeks ago: Lirael discovers the Circle's plan to sacrifice the unicorn
- Three days ago: The Circle attacks Lirael's grove; she barely escapes to seek help
- Present: The Third Ley Node is under active assault; the unicorn is captured

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Malakor]] | Corrupt the Heart Tree and prove his dark masters right | Rituals at Ley Nodes, sacrificing the unicorn |
| [[Lirael]] | Save the Whisperwood and the unicorn she loves | Guide heroes, share knowledge, sacrifice if necessary |
| [[Elder Thorn]] | Understand what threatens the wards | Sending the party in his stead (he cannot leave [[Oakhaven]]) |
| The Unicorn (Silverlight) | Survive, protect the forest's last hope | Held captive, awaiting rescue or death |
| Rotmother Thess | Prove her devotion to the new way | Guarding the First Node, hunting intruders |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:**
The Whisperwood begins healing. The corruption recedes over months of careful tending by [[The Grey Wardens]]. The unicorn Silverlight becomes an ally to the party and the region. The Covenant loses a major operation and must find another way to weaken the seals. [[Elder Thorn]] learns the truth about the threats facing his order and begins to suspect the Covenant's existence.

**If the party fails:**
The Whisperwood transforms into the "Rotwood"—a nightmare forest of twisted vegetation, corrupted beasts, and spreading decay. The ward-totems maintained by [[The Grey Wardens]] fail. The Seal-Point beneath Grandfather Oak's grove weakens significantly. [[Oakhaven]] is evacuated or destroyed. The corruption threatens [[The Greenfields]] and [[The Valdris Vale]] within months. The Covenant claims a major victory.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Cleanse the three Ley Nodes and defeat Malakor before he corrupts the Heart Tree.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Save the unicorn Silverlight from ritual sacrifice
2. Learn the identity of Malakor's Covenant contacts
3. Recover Malakor's journal documenting his corruption (evidence for [[The Grey Wardens]])
4. Save any Circle of Rot members who can still be redeemed

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Discover that the corruption channels toward something buried deep beneath the forest (the Seal-Point)
2. Learn that Fern Willowbark, a Grey Warden they may meet, has unknowingly been weakening the wards

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- At least two of three Ley Nodes are cleansed (one can remain corrupted if time runs out)
- Malakor is defeated (killed or captured)
- The Heart Tree is not corrupted (if it falls, the Whisperwood is lost regardless of other victories)

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- All three Ley Nodes remain corrupted when Malakor completes his ritual
- The Heart Tree is corrupted (total failure—the forest is lost)
- The party flees the forest without confronting Malakor (he completes the ritual within days)

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Rot (Session 1)
**Goal:** Enter the corrupted forest and reach the First Ley Node.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Village Edge:** The party meets [[Elder Thorn]] at [[Oakhaven]], who confirms the corruption and provides what guidance he can. He cannot enter the forest himself due to his bargain, but he senses great wrong. He provides a Warden guide—Fern Willowbark—who will accompany them to the forest's edge.

2. **The Dead River:** The first sign of corruption—a stream that once ran clear now flows with black sludge that burns flesh. Crossing requires creativity. **Two Black Puddings** lurk beneath the surface, drawn to movement.

3. **The Corrupted Bear:** A massive **Cave Bear** (corrupted, half its fur fallen out to reveal pustulent flesh) attacks the party. This was once a guardian beast of the forest, now a mindless engine of destruction. Killing it is merciful.

4. **The First Node - The Rotmother's Garden:** The former Grove of Starlight, now a festering swamp. **Rotmother Thess**, a Circle of Rot druid, guards it with **two Blights (Needle and Vine)**. The node itself is a standing stone wrapped in diseased vines. To cleanse it, the party must defeat Thess and perform a simple purification ritual (Nature DC 13 or Religion DC 15) while pouring pure water on the stone.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The Circle of Rot consists of at least four druids who turned against nature
- The corruption flows along underground channels toward "somewhere deep"
- Two more nodes must be cleansed before Malakor completes his work

**Transition to Act 2:**
Lirael, if conscious, or signs in the forest direct the party deeper—toward the Heart Tree and the remaining nodes.

### Act 2: The Hunt (Session 2)
**Goal:** Reach the Heart Tree while being hunted, cleanse the Second Node, and make a critical choice.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Stalking:** The party realizes they are being hunted. **Two Displacer Beasts** and **a pack of four Corrupted Wolves** track them through the dying forest. The party can fight, flee, or attempt to lose them. These creatures were sent by Malakor.

2. **Lirael's Grove (The Second Node):** The party discovers Lirael's home grove—once beautiful, now rotting. If Lirael is with them, she weeps. The node here is a pool that has turned to tar. A **Shambling Mound** (reflavored as a Rot Mound—masses of decomposed vegetation animated by corruption) guards it. Cleansing requires the same ritual but with an additional component: a personal sacrifice (blood willingly given, a cherished possession destroyed, or a memory surrendered).

3. **The Cage Tree:** The party discovers a massive hollow tree where Malakor keeps prisoners—including the unicorn Silverlight, bound by thorned vines, and possibly a captured Grey Warden or lost villager. Freeing them attracts the attention of a **Vine Blight swarm (three Blights)**.

4. **The Choice - The Burning Grove:** A secondary grove is actively being corrupted by **two Circle of Rot acolytes**. The party can see smoke rising from the direction of the Heart Tree—Malakor is beginning his final ritual. They must choose: save this grove and lose time (adding difficulty to the final confrontation), or pursue Malakor and let the grove fall (the corruption will spread regardless of victory, complicating the aftermath).

**Rising Tension:**
- The forest grows darker and more hostile as they progress
- Animals flee in terror or attack mindlessly
- The trees themselves seem to watch with malevolent intent
- Whispers promise power if they would only stop fighting

**Midpoint Twist:**
If Lirael is with the party, she reveals the unicorn Silverlight is more than a creature—it carries a fragment of the Whisperwood's original spirit, placed there during [[The Age of Shadows]] as a failsafe. If Silverlight dies, the forest's ability to heal itself dies with it.

**Transition to Act 3:**
The path to the Heart Tree opens before them. The third node is there, beneath the ancient tree's roots. Malakor waits.

### Act 3: The Heart (Session 3)
**Goal:** Stop Malakor's ritual, cleanse the final node, and save the Heart Tree.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Approach:** The Heart Tree is visible for miles—a colossal oak whose upper branches have turned black while its lower trunk still shows green. Corrupted vines pulse with dark energy flowing up toward the crown. The air tastes of decay. Around the tree, the Third Ley Node glows with sickly purple light as Malakor chants.

2. **The Heart Tree Clearing:** Malakor stands before a corrupted altar made of fused bones and rotting wood. The Third Ley Node—a crystal formation at the tree's roots—pulses with shadow. If the unicorn was not rescued, it lies bound on the altar, blood being drawn by thorned vines. If rescued, Malakor has substituted a captured dryad (one of Lirael's sisters).

3. **Malakor's Transformation:** When confronted, Malakor does not flee. He has been waiting. He speaks of rebirth, of how the "old ways" failed to save his grove, and how only through death can true growth occur. Then he channels the corruption directly into himself and transforms—his body bloating, splitting, and merging with the rot around him.

**Climactic Encounter:**
**The Heart of Rot** (see Boss Encounter below)

**Resolution Options:**
- **Total Victory:** Malakor defeated, unicorn saved, Third Node cleansed. The Heart Tree begins to heal immediately, shedding corrupted branches. The Whisperwood will recover within a year.
- **Partial Victory:** Malakor defeated, but unicorn killed or Third Node not cleansed. The Heart Tree survives but is weakened. Recovery will take decades and require Grey Warden intervention.
- **Pyrrhic Victory:** Malakor defeated, but Heart Tree corrupted. The tree must be cut down (a task requiring [[The Grey Wardens]]' blessing) to stop the spread. The Whisperwood survives but is scarred forever.

## Locations

### Overview Map
The adventure moves roughly west to east through the Whisperwood's interior. The party enters from [[Oakhaven]] at the western edge, passes through the Dead River crossing (northwest), reaches the First Node (north-central), continues to the Second Node/Lirael's Grove (central), potentially detours to the Cage Tree or Burning Grove (northeast), and finally arrives at the Heart Tree (eastern depths).

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[The Whisperwood]] (Corrupted)

**Description:** Once a place of silver-barked trees and bioluminescent wonder, the corrupted Whisperwood is a nightmare made real. Grey mist hangs perpetually at knee height, smelling of rot. Trees that once whispered secrets now groan in pain or stand silent as gravestones. The bioluminescent plants have dimmed or turned sickly purple. Animals either flee or attack, driven mad by corruption flowing through the land. The deeper one travels, the worse it becomes—trees twisted into impossible shapes, ground that squelches with decay, and shadows that move against the light.

**Key Features:**
- Perpetual twilight even at midday due to dying canopy
- Black sludge in streams and pooled in hollows
- Corrupted animals that attack without warning
- Trees that seem to watch and occasionally move
- Whispers that promise power or threaten doom

**Encounters Here:**
- Random corrupted beast encounters
- Environmental hazards (caustic sludge, unstable ground, grasping vines)
- The constant sense of being watched

### Location 2: The First Ley Node (Rotmother's Garden)
**Description:** Once called the Grove of Starlight for the way moonlight filtered through its silver leaves, this sacred clearing is now a festering swamp. The standing stone at its center, carved with ancient druidic symbols, has been wrapped in diseased vines that pulse with unnatural life. The water is black, the earth is soft and grasping, and the stench of decay overpowers everything.

**Key Features:**
- Standing stone (Ley Node focus) wrapped in corrupted vines
- Swampy terrain (difficult terrain, risk of sinking)
- Dead animals arranged in ritual patterns around the edges
- Rotmother Thess's ritual circle of toadstools

**Encounters Here:**
- Rotmother Thess (Circle of Rot Druid, CR 3)
- Two Blights (Needle and Vine)
- Environmental hazard: Toxic Spores (Constitution save DC 12 or poisoned for 1 hour)

### Location 3: Lirael's Grove (The Second Ley Node)
**Description:** This was Lirael's home for three centuries—a secret grove of white-flowered trees surrounding a crystalline pool. Now the flowers have withered black, the trees are skeletal, and the pool has transformed into a pit of viscous tar. Lirael's treehouse hangs in ruin, its delicate construction rotted through. The node here manifests as the pool itself—once a mirror that could show true visions, now blind with corruption.

**Key Features:**
- Tar pool (Ley Node focus) that was once a scrying pool
- Ruined treehouse (can be searched for supplies and a letter from Lirael to Silverlight)
- Skeletal remains of dryads who couldn't flee in time
- Rot Mound (Shambling Mound) that rises from the tar when approached

**Encounters Here:**
- Rot Mound (Shambling Mound reflavored)
- Environmental hazard: Tar Pool (Strength DC 14 to escape if you fall in, 2d6 acid damage per round)

### Location 4: The Heart Tree
**Description:** The Heart Tree is ancient beyond reckoning—a massive oak whose trunk would take twenty people holding hands to encircle. It has stood since before humans came to Valdoria, and some say it was planted by the Architects of Dawn themselves. Now it is dying. The upper two-thirds of its branches have turned black and brittle, weeping dark sap. The lower trunk still shows patches of healthy bark, a testament to the tree's desperate fight for survival. At its roots, where the Third Ley Node manifests as a crystal formation, Malakor has constructed his altar of corruption.

**Key Features:**
- The Heart Tree itself (massive, partially corrupted)
- Corruption altar at the roots (bone and rotted wood)
- Third Ley Node (crystal formation in the roots)
- Clearing surrounded by a ring of dead trees (no cover)
- Branches that occasionally drop corrupted matter

**Encounters Here:**
- Malakor the Blighted (Boss)
- Corrupted Shambling Mound (if unicorn was rescued)
- Environmental hazard: Falling Corruption (random targeting, Dexterity save DC 12 or 2d6 necrotic damage)

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| [[Oakhaven]] | Dead River | 4 hours | Corrupted wildlife, difficult terrain |
| Dead River | First Node | 3 hours | Black Puddings, grasping terrain |
| First Node | Second Node | 5 hours | Stalking predators, toxic spores |
| Second Node | Cage Tree | 2 hours | Vine Blights, disorienting mist |
| Second Node | Heart Tree | 4 hours | All previous hazards intensified |
| Cage Tree | Heart Tree | 3 hours | Time pressure, Malakor's minions |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### Lirael, Dryad of the Eastern Grove
**Role:** Quest Giver / Guide / Ally

**Description:** Lirael is a dryad who has watched over the Whisperwood's eastern reaches for three centuries. Before the corruption, her bark-skin was silver-white, and flowers bloomed in her leaf-hair with each season. Now her bark is cracked and grey, weeping black sap from the wounds she received fleeing the Circle of Rot. Her leaf-hair hangs limp and brown. Yet her amber eyes still hold fierce determination, and her voice—though weak—carries the authority of an ancient guardian.

**Personality:** Gentle but ancient; speaks in natural metaphors; fiercely protective of Silverlight; guilt-ridden that she couldn't stop the corruption alone

**What They Want:** To save the Whisperwood, rescue Silverlight, and see Malakor stopped—in that order of priority

**What They Know:**
- The locations of all three Ley Nodes
- Safe paths through the forest (though "safe" is relative now)
- Malakor's history and how he fell
- The true nature of Silverlight's importance

**How They Can Help:**
- Guide through the forest (advantage on survival checks)
- Translate the forest's warnings
- Perform the cleansing rituals at Ley Nodes (if the party cannot)
- Take a killing blow meant for a party member (she will sacrifice herself to save the unicorn's rescuers)

#### Silverlight (The Last Unicorn)
**Role:** Rescue Target / Living MacGuffin

**Description:** Silverlight is the last unicorn born in the Whisperwood—a creature of impossible beauty even in captivity. Her coat is pale as starlight, her mane flows like liquid silver, and her horn glows with gentle warmth. Bound by corrupted vines at the Cage Tree or Malakor's altar, she does not struggle or cry out, but her eyes—ancient and knowing—plead silently for aid. She carries within her a fragment of the Whisperwood's original spirit, making her simultaneously a powerful magical being and the forest's last hope for natural recovery.

**Personality:** Ancient wisdom in innocent form; communicates through emotions and images rather than words; trusts completely once trust is earned; will die rather than allow her power to serve corruption

**What They Want:** To live, to see the forest healed, to never again be alone

**What They Know:** Everything the forest knows—can share visions of the corruption's spread and Malakor's activities

**How They Can Help:**
- Her horn can purify corrupted water (once per day)
- Her presence grants advantage on saves against the forest's corruption
- If freed, she can cast Greater Restoration once and Heal once before exhaustion

### Neutrals

#### Fern Willowbark
**Role:** Grey Warden Guide (Compromised)

**Description:** A young human woman in her late twenties with sun-darkened skin and close-cropped brown hair. She wears the grey-green of the Grey Wardens with obvious pride. What no one knows—not even Fern herself—is that [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] has been manipulating her through dreams, convincing her that small "improvements" to the ward-totems serve a higher purpose. She is not evil; she believes she is helping. If the party brings her into the forest, she may inadvertently report their progress to Covenant handlers.

**Personality:** Earnest, eager to prove herself, slightly nervous about the deep forest, conflicted by dreams she doesn't fully understand

**What They Want:** To prove herself worthy of the Grey Wardens, to understand the strange dreams she's been having

**Attitude Toward Party:** Helpful and friendly, though she'll try to steer them away from certain areas (ward-totem locations) without understanding why she feels compelled to do so

#### Elder Thorn
**Role:** Information Source / Quest Authority

**Description:** A blind halfling druid of extreme age who leads [[The Grey Wardens]] from [[Oakhaven]]. He perceives the world through the forest's roots and creatures, which is how he knows something terrible is happening despite being unable to leave the village's edge. His bargain with the forest spirit means leaving would kill him instantly.

**Personality:** Cryptic, patient, deeply worried beneath his calm exterior, speaks in riddles that contain truth

**What They Want:** To understand the threat and protect the wards his order has maintained for centuries

**Attitude Toward Party:** Hopeful but cautious; will provide what aid he can but cannot act directly

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: Malakor the Blighted
**Role:** Final Boss / Fallen Druid

**Description:** Once Malakor was a gentle soul who wept for every tree felled and healed every wounded animal that crossed his path. That Malakor died when logging operations destroyed his sacred grove while [[The Grey Wardens]] did nothing—too concerned with "greater matters" to help one small circle. The being that remains wears Malakor's face but views all life through the lens of decay. His robes are woven from grave-moss and rotting leaves. His staff is a twisted branch that constantly drips black sap. His eyes have filmed over with white, yet he sees perfectly—sees the rot in all things, the death that waits within every living creature. He has embraced the Covenant's dark teachings not because he was corrupted against his will, but because they gave him a framework for the despair he already felt.

**Personality:** Bitter, philosophical, genuinely believes death and decay are liberation; speaks softly and reasonably even while doing terrible things; sees himself as a healer—healing the world of the disease called "life"

**Motivation:** To prove that the natural cycle of decay is the only true path; to punish the world that failed him by accelerating its return to rot; to become something more than mortal through the Covenant's promised "rebirth"

**Methods:** Corrupts ley lines through ritual, transforms willing followers through rot magic, sacrifices creatures of purity to fuel greater corruption, uses the forest's own creatures as weapons

**Weakness:** The memory of what he was; if confronted with evidence of his grove's restoration or his former friends' love, he hesitates. His transformation is incomplete—he can still feel pain, doubt, and regret, though he suppresses these as weakness.

**Combat Notes:** Before transformation, Malakor fights as a Circle of Spores druid with emphasis on necrotic damage and fungal minions. After channeling the corruption (round 3 of combat or when reduced to half HP), he transforms into a larger, more monstrous form with increased hit points and legendary actions.

#### Secondary Antagonist: Rotmother Thess
**Role:** Mini-Boss at First Node

**Description:** Thess was never as gentle as Malakor. She joined the druid circles for power, not love of nature, and chafed under traditions that limited what she could do. When Malakor offered her true power—power without restriction—she accepted eagerly. Now she tends the First Ley Node's corruption like a beloved garden, nurturing diseases and plagues with maternal care.

**Connection to Primary:** She was one of Malakor's first converts and remains fanatically loyal. She calls him "Father Rot" and views the corruption as a blessing he bestowed upon her.

#### Boss Encounter: The Heart of Rot
**Location:** The Heart Tree

**Setup:** Malakor stands before the corrupted altar, chanting. If the unicorn is not yet rescued, it lies bleeding on the altar, thorned vines drawing its blood into ritual channels. The Third Ley Node pulses with shadow energy. Corrupted branches creak ominously overhead.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Malakor the Blighted | 1 | CR 5 Circle of Spores Druid, transforms at half HP |
| Corrupted Shambling Mound | 1 | Only if unicorn was previously rescued |
| Vine Blight | 2 | Reinforcements arrive round 4 if battle continues |

**Phases/Tactics:**

**Phase 1 - The Bitter Druid (HP 60):**
Malakor fights as a spellcaster, maintaining distance. He casts Spike Growth to control terrain, uses Infestation and Chill Touch for damage, and activates Symbiotic Entity when first engaged in melee. He monologues about the peace of decay, the futility of fighting death, and how the party has already lost because the forest belongs to rot now.

**Phase 2 - The Blighted One (HP 45, triggered at half HP or round 3):**
Malakor channels the corruption directly into himself. His body bloats and splits, bark erupting from his skin, fungal growths bursting from his wounds. He gains:
- Resistance to nonmagical weapon damage
- Multiattack (2 claw attacks, 1d8+3 slashing + 1d6 necrotic each)
- Corrupting Touch (recharge 5-6): 15-foot cone, Constitution DC 14, 4d6 necrotic damage, half on save
- Speed reduced to 20 feet

**Lair Actions (Initiative 20):**
Choose one:
- Grasping Roots: One creature must succeed on Strength DC 14 or be restrained until the end of its next turn
- Falling Corruption: Each creature must succeed on Dexterity DC 12 or take 2d6 necrotic damage from falling corrupted matter
- Whispers of Rot: Each creature must succeed on Wisdom DC 13 or be frightened until the end of its next turn

**Legendary Actions (Phase 2 only, 2/round):**
- Move (1 action): Move up to half speed without provoking
- Claw (1 action): Make one claw attack
- Spore Burst (2 actions): Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on Constitution DC 14 or take 2d8 necrotic damage

**Victory Conditions:**
- Malakor reduced to 0 HP
- The ritual is interrupted (killing Malakor or destroying the altar—AC 15, HP 30, immune to necrotic)
- Cleansing the Third Node (possible during combat if party splits—very difficult)

**Rewards:** See Rewards section

### Social Encounters

#### Fern's Conflict
**Location:** During travel through the forest

**NPCs Present:** Fern Willowbark, party members

**Stakes:** Whether Fern realizes she's been compromised and helps the party or remains a unwitting threat

**Information Available:**
- Fern mentions strange dreams about "helping the forest in a deeper way"
- She unconsciously tries to steer the party away from ward-totem locations
- If confronted with evidence, she breaks down and reveals everything she remembers

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Insight | 14 | Notice Fern's strange behavior | Miss the signs entirely |
| Persuasion | 16 | Get Fern to open up about her dreams | She clams up and becomes suspicious |
| Intimidation | 18 | Force Fern to confront her actions | She flees or attacks in panic |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Fern realizes the truth, becomes a valuable ally with insider knowledge, can warn [[The Grey Wardens]]
- Moderate: Fern is confused but helpful; the Covenant loses their agent but gains no information from this adventure
- Worst: Fern remains compromised; the Covenant learns detailed information about the party's activities

#### Malakor's Monologue
**Location:** The Heart Tree (before or during combat)

**NPCs Present:** Malakor, party members, possibly Lirael

**Stakes:** Understanding Malakor's fall; possibility of redemption or at least hesitation

**Information Available:**
- How Malakor fell to the Covenant's influence
- The name "Covenant of the Unveiled Truth" if not previously known
- Hints about larger operations beyond this forest
- His genuine pain and how it was exploited

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 20 | Malakor hesitates; party gains advantage round 1 | No effect |
| History/Nature | 14 | Recall his original grove; mention it to cause hesitation | Cannot find the right words |
| Insight | 12 | Recognize his pain as genuine; understand he can still feel | See only a monster |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Malakor hesitates long enough to allow the party a surprise round; dies asking if his grove could truly be restored
- Moderate: Standard combat; Malakor dies cursing the world
- Worst: Party's attempts to talk enrage him; he gains advantage on his first round of attacks

### Exploration Challenges

#### Navigating the Corrupted Forest
**Location:** Throughout the Whisperwood

**Description:** The forest itself resists travel. Paths shift, landmarks disappear, and the corruption creates disorienting effects.

**Skills Useful:**
- Survival DC 14 to maintain direction
- Nature DC 12 to identify safe versus dangerous areas
- Perception DC 13 to notice ambush preparations
- With Lirael: Advantage on all these checks

**Hazards:**
- Getting lost adds 1d4 hours to travel time
- Wandering into a corrupted pocket (Constitution DC 12 or gain 1 level of exhaustion)
- Triggering a random corrupted beast encounter

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Hidden Grey Warden cache (2 Potions of Healing, 50 feet rope, supplies)
- Uncorrupted spring (rest here removes exhaustion, refreshes resources)
- Malakor's original grove site (evidence of what was lost; can be used in social encounter)

#### The Ley Node Cleansing Ritual
**Location:** Each of the three Ley Nodes

**Description:** Cleansing a corrupted Ley Node requires a specific ritual. Lirael can perform it automatically, but if she is unconscious or dead, the party must attempt it themselves.

**Skills Useful:**
- Nature DC 13 to understand the ritual requirements
- Religion DC 15 as an alternative approach (calling on nature spirits)
- Arcana DC 16 to force the cleansing through magical means (causes backlash: 2d6 necrotic damage to the caster)

**Hazards:**
- Failed attempts alert nearby enemies
- The corruption fights back (Constitution DC 14 or be poisoned for 1 hour)
- Partial cleansing is worse than none (destabilizes the node, causing an explosion: 3d6 necrotic in 20-foot radius)

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Understanding the corruption's true source (the Seal-Point beneath Grandfather Oak)
- Fragments of the original protective magic (can be used to enhance weapons: +1d6 radiant damage against corrupted creatures for 24 hours)

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Circle of Rot exists | Oakhaven | Elder Thorn's briefing | First Node |
| Malakor leads the Circle | First Node | Thess's notes or interrogation | Understanding the enemy |
| Three Nodes must be cleansed | Lirael or Thess's notes | Dialogue or documents | Full objective clarity |
| Corruption flows underground | Second Node | Successful Nature check | Hidden objective (Seal-Point) |
| Silverlight's true nature | Lirael (midpoint) | Dialogue | Raised stakes |
| Covenant connection | Malakor's journal | Found on his body | Campaign connection |
| Fern is compromised | Fern's behavior | Observation and Insight | Side plot resolution |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. **The Logging Camp:** An abandoned logging camp shows signs of violence. It appears the corruption originated here. In truth, the loggers fled weeks ago when animals turned rabid—they're not responsible, just victims.
2. **The Standing Stones:** Ancient stones covered in moss seem significant. A successful History check reveals they're just trail markers from the old Elven roads—unrelated to the Ley Nodes.

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The corruption doesn't just spread randomly—it flows toward something. The Seal-Point beneath the Whisperwood, one of the five seals binding [[The Shackled God]], is the true target. Malakor may not even fully understand what he serves.

**When It's Revealed:** When cleansing the Second or Third Node, or upon defeating Malakor and examining the altar's construction.

**Impact:** This elevates the stakes from a local environmental horror to a piece of a much larger conspiracy. The party realizes they've stopped one operation of many.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Pit Trap (Corrupted) | Path to First Node | Pressure plate (buried leaves) | 10-foot fall into corrupted mud | Perception DC 14 to spot | 1d6 bludgeoning + 2d4 necrotic |
| Grasping Vines | Cage Tree entrance | Proximity | Restrained; vines deal damage each round | Dexterity DC 14 to avoid | 1d6 piercing per round |
| Spore Cloud | Rotmother's Garden | Stepping on ritual toadstools | Poison cloud fills 10-foot area | Constitution DC 12 | Poisoned condition 1 hour |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Corrupted Water | Throughout | 2d4 acid damage per round of contact | Don't touch it; use purification magic |
| Toxic Air Pockets | Deep forest | Constitution DC 13 or 1 level exhaustion | Nature DC 12 to detect and avoid |
| Unstable Ground | Near Ley Nodes | Dexterity DC 12 or sink knee-deep, difficult terrain | Move slowly; Survival to identify |
| Corrupted Rain (Act 3) | Heart Tree area | 1d4 necrotic per minute of exposure | Find cover; magical protection |

### Puzzles

#### The Ley Node Sequence
**Location:** Third Ley Node at the Heart Tree

**Description:** The altar protecting the Third Node has three crystal receptacles arranged in a triangle. To begin the cleansing without combat (or to weaken Malakor), the crystals must be activated in the correct sequence while speaking words of purification in Sylvan.

**Solution:** The crystals correspond to the three Ley Nodes. They must be activated in the order the nodes were corrupted (First, Second, Third—which requires learning this information earlier). The Sylvan words translate to "Roots remember, branches forgive, leaves return."

**Hints:**
- Lirael knows the words but may be unconscious
- Thess's notes mention the corruption sequence
- A Nature DC 16 check reveals the pattern through the feel of the corruption

**Bypass Options:**
- Destroy the altar (alerts Malakor, starts combat immediately)
- Kill Malakor first (his death disrupts the protection)
- Raw magical force (Arcana DC 18, causes 3d6 necrotic backlash)

- **Story Hooks:** The Covenant connection leads to further investigation; Fern's handlers remain unknown; the Seal-Point's discovery raises questions about what else [[The Grey Wardens]] don't know

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| The Burning Grove choice | Save the grove or pursue Malakor | Saving adds time; Malakor gains advantages. Pursuing leaves lasting corruption in the forest. |
| Fern's fate | Confront, ignore, or expose her | Confronting gains an ally and Covenant intel. Ignoring leaves the leak active. Exposing to Wardens without care destroys her. |
| Malakor's end | Kill, capture, or attempt redemption | Killing is simplest. Capturing provides Covenant intelligence. Redemption attempt is extremely difficult (DC 20+) but provides the most information. |
| Silverlight's rescue | Prioritize or delay | Prioritizing may require splitting the party or rushing. Delaying risks her death in the final ritual. |
| The Third Node | Cleanse during combat or after | During combat is very difficult but weakens Malakor. After is easier but Malakor may partially succeed. |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Sneak past some encounters to reach the Heart Tree quickly. High risk, high reward—failure means fighting exhausted.
- **Diplomacy:** Limited options. Thess is fanatical. Malakor can be made to hesitate but not convinced. Best used to learn information before inevitable combat.
- **Brute Force:** Fight everything, cleanse nothing until the end. Possible but exhausting; the party will be depleted for the final battle.
- **Deception:** Pretend to be interested in joining the Circle of Rot. Requires excellent deception and a strong stomach for witnessing atrocities.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- **Party defeated but not killed:** Malakor captures them for sacrifice; they wake in the Cage Tree with a chance to escape and try again
- **Nodes not cleansed:** The forest remains corrupted but the Heart Tree survives; future adventures involve healing efforts
- **Unicorn dies:** The forest can still be saved but recovery takes decades; creates long-term regional consequences
- **Total Party Kill:** [[The Grey Wardens]] eventually mount their own offensive; the party's sacrifice is honored, and new characters can continue the campaign

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:**
The Heart Tree sheds its corrupted branches in a shower of black leaves that turn to ash before they hit the ground. New green shoots appear within hours. Silverlight, if freed, touches her horn to the ground and a wave of warmth spreads outward, pushing back the corruption visibly. Animals emerge from hiding. Birds sing for the first time in months. Lirael (if alive) weeps with joy and thanks the party in words too ancient for translation. [[The Grey Wardens]] arrive within days to begin the long process of full restoration.

**If Failed:**
The Heart Tree convulses and dies, its trunk splitting to reveal a hollow filled with writhing darkness. The corruption spreads explosively. [[Oakhaven]] has perhaps a week before it must be evacuated. The Whisperwood becomes the Rotwood—a festering wound on the land that threatens everything nearby. [[The Grey Wardens]] are devastated. [[Elder Thorn]] makes a final journey into the dying forest and does not return.

**If Partial Success:**
The Heart Tree survives but is weakened. Patches of corruption remain throughout the forest. [[The Grey Wardens]] must dedicate significant resources to containment. The Whisperwood will recover, but it will take generations, not years. The party is thanked, but there's an undercurrent of "it could have been better."

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] loses this operation but learns the party exists as a threat
- [[The Grey Wardens]] become more vigilant and may request the party's aid in the future
- The Seal-Point beneath the Whisperwood is now known to the party; this knowledge will become important
- If Fern is redeemed, she becomes a valuable intelligence asset; if exposed improperly, the Covenant adds another enemy to their list
- Regional stability improves (or worsens dramatically if failed), affecting trade, settlement, and future adventures

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. Who were Malakor's Covenant contacts? The trail leads toward [[Rivergard]].
2. If Fern was compromised, who else in [[The Grey Wardens]] might be?
3. The Seal-Point exists—what exactly is it, and are there others?
4. Malakor mentioned "other operations"—where are they?
5. If any Circle of Rot members escaped, they may seek revenge.

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Lirael | Recovers slowly; becomes lifelong ally | Dies defending the Heart Tree |
| Silverlight | Lives; becomes regional guardian | Sacrificed; the forest loses its hope |
| Malakor | Dead or captured | Transforms fully; becomes regional threat |
| Rotmother Thess | Dead | Inherits Malakor's mantle if he falls |
| Fern Willowbark | Redeemed or exposed | Continues as unknowing Covenant asset |
| Elder Thorn | Grateful; shares knowledge | Dies attempting to seal the Rotwood |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Emphasize the sensory horror of the corruption—the smell, the sounds, the wrongness
- Give Malakor a sympathetic backstory that doesn't excuse his actions; he chose this path
- Use Lirael as an emotional anchor—her love for the forest and Silverlight should be palpable
- The forest should feel like a character—its suffering should move the players
- Don't let the difficulty of the final fight be underestimated; this is meant to be challenging
- If the party is struggling, have Silverlight's presence provide tangible benefits

### Pacing Suggestions
- **Session 1:** Hook, travel to First Node, First Node encounter, begin travel to Second
- **Session 2:** Stalking encounter, Second Node, Cage Tree/Burning Grove choice, approach Heart Tree
- **Session 3:** Final confrontation with Malakor, aftermath, rewards

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to purify water magically | It works but draws attention; the corruption resists |
| Attempt to communicate with corrupted animals | Insight DC 15 reveals pain beneath the madness; some can be calmed |
| Split the party | Each group faces full encounters; very dangerous |
| Try to fly over the forest | Works for short distances; the canopy blocks longer flights |
| Capture Malakor alive | He can provide Covenant information but is dangerous to transport |
| Refuse to enter the forest | Lirael dies within a day; guilt and Grey Warden pressure follow |
| Try to destroy the corruption at its source | They'd need to find the Seal-Point first; that's a future adventure |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Remove one Displacer Beast from the Stalking encounter
- Reduce Malakor's Phase 2 HP to 30
- Give the party an extra Potion of Healing at the Grey Warden cache
- Have Silverlight's presence grant temporary HP (5) at the start of each encounter

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add a third Black Pudding at the Dead River
- Give Rotmother Thess a Wand of Entangle with 3 charges
- Add an additional Shambling Mound at the Heart Tree
- Give Malakor a 3rd Legendary Action per round

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- Malakor's journal mentions "the Voice of Chains" and "the master's promise"—references to [[The Prophet of Chains]]
- The Seal-Point connection hints at the larger conspiracy
- Fern's corruption suggests the Covenant has agents in many organizations
- If the party questions Malakor or Thess, they mention "the Citadel" without context—this is [[The Citadel of Tears]]

## Secrets

1. **The Seal-Point Connection:** The corruption doesn't just spread—it specifically flows toward the Seal-Point beneath Grandfather Oak's grove. Malakor may not fully understand this; he was told only that his ritual would "feed the earth." The Covenant is using him.

2. **Fern's True Role:** Fern Willowbark is being used by the Covenant not just for information but to subtly damage the ward-totems. Her "improvements" have been weakening the very protections she thinks she's maintaining. If this continues, the Seal-Point will be exposed regardless of Malakor's success.

3. **Silverlight's Burden:** The unicorn carries a fragment of the Whisperwood's original spirit—a failsafe created during [[The Age of Shadows]] when the Seal-Point was established. If Silverlight dies, the forest loses not just its ability to heal naturally but its connection to its own ancient past. The Covenant knows this; that's why they targeted Silverlight specifically.

4. **Malakor's Last Chance:** In his heart, Malakor knows what he's done is wrong. He chose corruption because despair seemed easier than hope, but a small part of him prays for someone to stop him. If the party can reach that part—by mentioning his original grove, by showing him proof that nature can heal, by offering him redemption without condemnation—he will hesitate. It won't save him, but it might save his soul.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. **Valerius's Ledger:** The party recovered documentation in a previous adventure that mentioned "the Whisperwood operation" and payments to someone called "M.B."
2. **Grey Warden Request:** [[Elder Thorn]] sent word to allies requesting adventurers to investigate why his patrols have gone silent.
3. **The Dying Dryad:** The party encounters Lirael on the road, collapsed and begging for help.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **The Covenant Trail:** Malakor's journal and effects lead toward [[Rivergard]], where Voice of Gold (possibly [[The Nightmaster]]) operates.
2. **The Seal-Point Mystery:** What exactly is beneath the Whisperwood, and are there other seal-points in danger?
3. **The Infiltration Problem:** If Fern was compromised, who else has the Covenant turned? A spy hunt within [[The Grey Wardens]] beckons.
4. **The Rotwood Rising:** If the party failed, stopping the corruption's spread becomes urgent. The Rotwood must be contained before it consumes the Greenfields.
5. **Silverlight's Quest:** If rescued, the unicorn may ask the party to help restore other sacred sites or protect other creatures of pure magic from the Covenant's predations.

## Notes
- This adventure bridges the investigation-focused early campaign with the action-heavy middle arc
- The environmental horror theme distinguishes it from dungeon crawls
- Malakor should be sympathetic but not excusable—his choice, even if understandable, was still wrong
- The failure states are harsh but not campaign-ending; even total failure creates interesting future content
- The Covenant connection should feel like a piece of a larger puzzle, not the whole picture
- Consider having the Whisperwood's recovery (or fall) be referenced in future adventures
