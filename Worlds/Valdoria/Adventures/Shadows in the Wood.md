> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
Based on intelligence from Valerius's ledger, the party enters the ancient **Whisperwood**. A corrupted druid circle, the **Circle of Rot**, has been poisoning the forest's ley lines to feed dark energy into the earth—energy destined for the Imprisoned. The party must navigate the twisting, hostile forest, locate the corruption's source, and defeat the mutated guardians before the damage is irreversible.
