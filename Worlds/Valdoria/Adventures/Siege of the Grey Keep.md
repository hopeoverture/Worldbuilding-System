> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
War has come to Valdoria. The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth unmasks its military might, marching a legion of hobgoblins, mercenaries, and summoned horrors toward the **Grey Keep**, the last bastion protecting the pass to the Sundered Peaks. The party must assume command (or key roles) in the defense, holding the walls against overwhelming odds to buy time for the **Sunstone's** energy to anchor the region's wards.
