# Siege of the Grey Keep

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
War has come to Valdoria. [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] unmasks its military might, marching a legion of hobgoblins, mercenaries, and summoned horrors toward the **Grey Keep**—the last bastion protecting the mountain pass to [[The Sundered Peaks]]. Five thousand enemies stand against three hundred defenders. When the Keep's commander falls to an assassin's blade in the opening hour, the party must assume command, hold the walls for three desperate days, and ultimately face Warlord Kragg himself as he descends on his wyvern to claim victory. This is not a battle that can be won through strength alone—it is a test of leadership, sacrifice, and the desperate courage that makes legends.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Siege Defense / War

**Tone:** Gritty / Desperate / Epic War

**Themes:**
- Heroism against overwhelming odds
- The weight of command and sacrifice
- The brutality and chaos of war
- Finding hope in darkness

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 3 Sessions (one per day of the siege)

**Party Level:** 7

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Hard (Endurance-focused)

**Combat Frequency:** Constant (waves of combat with brief respites)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Moderate (Command decisions, troop morale, NPC interactions)

**Exploration Emphasis:** Low (Fortress-based, some saboteur investigation)

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party arrives at the Grey Keep—perhaps delivering supplies, escorting refugees, or following leads from a previous adventure. As they enter the fortress, war horns echo from the eastern hills. The horizon darkens with an approaching army: rank upon rank of hobgoblins, war machines, and something massive circling overhead. Before anyone can react, Commander Aldric Ironfist collapses at the war table, a poisoned needle in his neck. The saboteur has struck first blood. With no clear chain of command, panicked soldiers look to the party for leadership.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Lieutenant Mara Blackwood]]
**Motivation:** Preserve the garrison, honor the fallen Commander, protect the mountain pass from enemy forces
**What They Offer:** Command authority, access to fortress resources, the gratitude of the realm, and payment from [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] (500 gp per party member if successful)

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- An army of approximately 5,000 troops approaches, led by the notorious [[Warlord Kragg]]
- The Keep has 300 defenders: 200 soldiers, 50 archers, 30 cavalry, and 20 support staff
- Reinforcements from [[Highwall]] could arrive in three days if messengers get through
- The Commander's death suggests a saboteur inside the walls
- The enemy army includes siege engines, wyvern riders, and at least one Hill Giant

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Critical

**Consequences of Delay:** Every hour without clear command causes troop morale to drop. The enemy army will begin their assault at dawn. If the Keep falls, the pass lies open, threatening [[The Sundered Peaks]] and the dwarven holds beyond.

## Background

### The Situation
[[Warlord Kragg]], a hobgoblin general of legendary cruelty, serves as the military arm of [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]. His mission: seize the Grey Keep to open a supply line for Covenant operations in the mountains, where they seek to access one of the seals binding [[The Shackled God]]. The Covenant has spent months preparing this assault, infiltrating a saboteur named Vex into the Keep disguised as a quartermaster's assistant. Kragg commands a disciplined hobgoblin legion reinforced by orc mercenaries, goblin sappers, and monstrous shock troops. He rides "Sky-Terror," an ancient wyvern, and intends to make an example of this fortress to discourage future resistance.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- Three months ago, [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] contracted [[Warlord Kragg]] to clear the eastern passes
- The saboteur Vex arrived six weeks ago with a refugee caravan, established cover as a quartermaster's assistant
- [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] received warnings but dismissed them as exaggerated reports
- [[The Grey Wardens]] noticed unusual troop movements but couldn't identify the threat in time
- Commander Aldric sent ravens requesting reinforcements a week ago; they were intercepted

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Warlord Kragg]] | Take the Keep within three days to maintain supply lines | Siege engines, aerial assault, overwhelming numbers |
| [[Lieutenant Mara]] | Hold the walls until reinforcements arrive | Rally troops, organize defenses, support party command |
| Vex the Saboteur | Ensure the Keep falls from within | Poison, sabotage, assassination of key personnel |
| [[The Party]] | Survive the siege and defeat Kragg | Leadership, heroics, rooting out the saboteur |
| Sergeant Brennan | Protect his soldiers and earn glory | Volunteers for dangerous missions, follows orders |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** The Grey Keep holds, Kragg's army is broken, and [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] loses a key military asset. The mountain passes remain secure. The party becomes legendary—the "Heroes of the Grey Keep"—earning fame, rewards, and the gratitude of multiple factions.

**If the party fails:** The Keep falls, opening the eastern passes to Covenant forces. Hundreds of soldiers die. The dwarven holds face invasion. [[The Sundered Peaks]] seal-points become accessible to the enemy. The balance of power in Valdoria shifts toward darkness.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Prevent the Grey Keep from falling for three days (72 hours) until reinforcements from [[Highwall]] arrive to break the siege.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Destroy the enemy's massive siege tower before it reaches the walls (prevents breach)
2. Identify and neutralize the saboteur Vex before they cause catastrophic damage
3. Get a messenger through enemy lines to confirm reinforcement timing
4. Protect the wounded in the infirmary from a night raid
5. Maintain garrison morale above breaking point

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Capture intelligence documents revealing Covenant operations in [[The Sundered Peaks]]
2. Turn Kragg's orc mercenaries against him by exploiting their grievances (reduces enemy numbers)

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The Keep's gates remain intact when reinforcements arrive
- At least 50 defenders survive to continue the fight
- Warlord Kragg is killed or driven off

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- The main gate is breached and held by enemy forces
- Garrison morale breaks completely, causing mass surrender or desertion
- All party members fall in combat
- The saboteur succeeds in destroying the armory or poisoning the water supply

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The First Wave (Day One)
**Goal:** Organize defenses, repel the vanguard assault, and establish command authority.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Fall of Command:** The party witnesses Commander Aldric's assassination and must take charge amid chaos. Soldiers look to them for orders. Lieutenant Mara offers support but needs someone to lead.
2. **The War Council:** The party meets with key officers (Lieutenant Mara, Sergeant Brennan, Quartermaster Thorne, Healer Elara) to assess resources, assign troops, and plan defensive positions. Key decisions: archer placement, cavalry deployment, gate reinforcement.
3. **The Vanguard Assault:** At dusk, 500 hobgoblin infantry attack the walls with scaling ladders. The party must lead the defense, choosing where to concentrate forces. Combat encounter with Hobgoblin Warlord (CR 5) and Hobgoblin soldiers.
4. **The First Night:** Between watches, the party can investigate the assassination, rally weary troops, or prepare for tomorrow. The saboteur plants seeds of doubt, spreading rumors that command is incompetent.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The enemy has three siege towers under construction, one nearly complete
- A Hill Giant has been spotted with the enemy reserves
- Something is wrong with the morning food supply (saboteur's first minor move)

**Transition to Act 2:** At dawn of the second day, scouts report the largest siege tower is nearly complete. It will reach the walls by nightfall unless destroyed.

### Act 2: The Long Night (Day Two)
**Goal:** Disrupt enemy operations, survive the siege tower assault, and unmask the saboteur.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **Sabotage Discovered:** The main gate mechanism has been jammed with slag metal. The gate cannot open for cavalry sorties or to receive reinforcements. The party must organize repairs while under arrow fire (skill challenge).
2. **The Night Raid:** The party leads a daring sortie to destroy the siege tower before it reaches the walls. Stealth through enemy camp, plant alchemist's fire, and escape before the explosion. Combat encounter with Hobgoblin Captains and goblin sappers.
3. **The Tower Falls:** If the raid succeeds, the siege tower burns spectacularly, killing dozens of enemies and buying time. If it fails, the tower hits the walls, creating a breach that must be defended.
4. **Unmask the Saboteur:** Clues point toward someone in the quartermaster's office. The party must identify Vex through investigation before they poison the water supply at midnight. Social and investigation encounter.
5. **The Breach Attempt:** Even without the tower, the enemy launches a night assault using goblin sappers with explosive charges. Frantic combat to prevent wall breaches.

**Rising Tension:** Casualties mount. Soldiers are exhausted. The saboteur's activities cause distrust among defenders. Food and arrow supplies run lower than expected.

**Midpoint Twist:** If the party captures Vex alive, they learn that Kragg carries intelligence documents about Covenant operations—and that he plans a personal assault on Day Three to ensure victory before reinforcements arrive.

**Transition to Act 3:** Dawn of Day Three brings the sound of a war horn. Kragg himself is coming.

### Act 3: The Final Push (Day Three)
**Goal:** Survive Kragg's personal assault and kill or drive off the Warlord to break the siege.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Giant's Assault:** At midday, the Hill Giant leads a direct assault on the main gate, battering it with a massive tree trunk while soldiers defend. The party must neutralize the giant before the gate falls.
2. **The Wyvern Riders:** Three wyverns strafe the walls, dropping alchemist's fire. The party must defend the battlements and bring down at least one wyvern.
3. **Kragg Descends:** When his army falters, Warlord Kragg lands Sky-Terror in the courtyard, determined to take the fortress personally. He challenges the party's leader to single combat—though he won't fight fair.
4. **Victory or Death:** The climactic battle against Kragg, his wyvern, and his elite guard. If Kragg falls, his army breaks. If he lives but is driven off, the siege continues until reinforcements arrive at sunset.

**Climactic Encounter:** Party vs. [[Warlord Kragg]] (CR 6), Sky-Terror the Wyvern (CR 6), 4 Hobgoblin Captains (CR 3 each).

**Resolution Options:**
- Kill Kragg: His army immediately breaks and retreats, siege ends in total victory
- Defeat Kragg but he escapes: Army retreats but enemy survives for future vengeance
- Drive off Kragg: Hold until reinforcements break the siege at sunset
- Capture Kragg alive: Major intelligence coup, but his army may attempt rescue

## Locations

### Overview Map
The Grey Keep sits in a narrow mountain pass, with steep cliffs on either side funneling all approaches to the main gate. The fortress consists of an outer curtain wall, a central courtyard, and an inner keep (the Tower of Vigilance). Behind the Keep, a narrow path leads up into [[The Sundered Peaks]].

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[Grey Keep]]

**Description:** A weathered stone fortress built into the mountainside, its grey granite walls rising sixty feet to crenellated battlements. The Keep has stood for three centuries, surviving a dozen sieges. Its position in the mountain pass makes it nearly impregnable—but "nearly" is not "completely."

**Key Features:**
- **Main Gate:** Iron-reinforced oak doors, twenty feet tall. Defended by murder holes and flanking towers.
- **Curtain Wall:** Sixty feet tall, fifteen feet thick. Archer positions every thirty feet.
- **Gate Towers:** Twin towers flanking the entrance, each with ballistae mounted on top.
- **Courtyard:** Central mustering area, 100 feet across. Contains well, armory entrance, and access to inner keep.
- **Tower of Vigilance:** The inner keep, four stories tall. Commander's quarters, war room, and last refuge.
- **The Cellar:** Underground supply storage, armory, and emergency escape tunnel (collapse risk).

**Encounters Here:** Wall defense, courtyard battle, final showdown with Kragg.

### Location 2: The Eastern Approach
**Description:** The killing ground before the Keep—a quarter-mile of rocky terrain funneled between cliff walls. Littered with defensive obstacles: caltrops, trenches, and sharpened stakes.

**Key Features:**
- Siege line: Where the enemy army encamps
- Siege tower construction zone (Day 1-2)
- Enemy command tent (Kragg's location)

**Encounters Here:** Observation, night raid, escape route for messenger.

### Location 3: The Infirmary
**Description:** A converted storage room in the Tower of Vigilance, now filled with cots for the wounded. Healer Elara runs it with three assistants.

**Key Features:**
- 20+ wounded soldiers requiring care
- Limited medical supplies
- Vulnerable to night raids through upper windows

**Encounters Here:** Protecting the wounded, investigating poison (saboteur may target here).

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Grey Keep | Enemy Camp | 1/4 mile | Arrow fire, patrols, open ground |
| Grey Keep | Escape Tunnel Exit | 1/2 mile (underground) | Collapse risk, darkness |
| Grey Keep | [[Highwall]] | 3 days march | Enemy scouts, mountain hazards |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### [[Lieutenant Mara Blackwood]]
**Role:** Second-in-Command, Party's Executive Officer

**Description:** A tall, stern woman in her late thirties with short-cropped grey hair and a scar across her jaw from a previous battle. She wears battered plate armor and carries a halberd that's seen decades of service. Her voice is steady even when everything burns around her.

**Personality:** Practical, stoic, fiercely loyal to her soldiers. She hides grief over Commander Aldric behind duty.

**What They Want:** To save as many of her soldiers as possible and honor Commander Aldric's memory.

**What They Know:** The Keep's defensive capabilities, garrison personnel, and that something felt wrong about the refugee caravan six weeks ago.

**How They Can Help:** Executes party orders, provides military advice, rallies troops, leads counterattacks.

#### Sergeant Brennan
**Role:** Veteran Infantry Leader

**Description:** A grizzled dwarf with a magnificent braided beard and an arm that ends at the elbow (lost to a wyvern fifteen years ago). He's the soldiers' heart—where he stands, they stand.

**Personality:** Gruff, darkly humorous, protective of younger soldiers. Secretly terrified but hides it perfectly.

**What They Want:** To die with honor if he must, but preferably to see his soldiers survive.

**What They Know:** The fortress layout, which soldiers are reliable, and that the quartermaster's assistant asks too many questions.

**How They Can Help:** Leads infantry, boosts morale, provides tactical insight, volunteers for suicide missions.

#### Healer Elara
**Role:** Chief Medical Officer

**Description:** A young half-elf woman with kind eyes and blood-stained robes. She's been awake for thirty hours and shows no signs of stopping.

**Personality:** Compassionate, determined, horrified by war but refuses to break.

**What They Want:** To save lives. Every life. She doesn't distinguish between defender and enemy wounded.

**What They Know:** The poison that killed Commander Aldric was rare—sourced from the Mirelands. Medical supply levels.

**How They Can Help:** Heals party members between encounters, identifies poisons, stabilizes critical NPCs.

### Neutrals

#### Quartermaster Thorne
**Role:** Supply Master (Unwitting Cover for Saboteur)

**Description:** An elderly man with thick spectacles and nervous hands. He's been the Keep's quartermaster for twenty years and is devastated that his department harbored a traitor.

**Personality:** Fussy, detail-oriented, deeply guilty when the sabotage is discovered.

**What They Want:** To prove his innocence and help catch the saboteur.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Cooperative, perhaps overly helpful in his guilt.

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: [[Warlord Kragg]]
**Role:** Enemy General, Final Boss

**Description:** Warlord Kragg stands seven feet tall, massive even by hobgoblin standards. His orange skin is covered in ritual scars, and his armor is decorated with the skulls of defeated commanders. His eyes burn with cold intelligence—this is no mere brute, but a tactical genius who has never lost a siege. He speaks Common with perfect diction, often quoting military philosophy before ordering atrocities. Sky-Terror, his ancient wyvern mount, is as feared as Kragg himself.

**Personality:** Coldly professional, utterly ruthless, respects capable enemies. He views war as art and slaughter as craft.

**Motivation:** Fulfill his contract with [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]], add another fortress to his legend, and test himself against worthy foes.

**Methods:** Overwhelming force, siege warfare, psychological terror (displays of executed prisoners), exploitation of weaknesses revealed by his saboteur.

**Weakness:** Pride. If challenged directly and publicly, he may accept single combat when tactically inadvisable. He also underestimates small-unit tactics—he thinks in army scale.

**Combat Notes:** Kragg fights with a massive glaive called "Widow-Maker" and wears enchanted plate armor. He opens combat from wyvern-back, then dismounts to face worthy foes personally. He has +1 plate armor and a +1 glaive (these become loot).

#### Secondary Antagonist: Vex the Saboteur
**Role:** Inside Threat, Investigation Target

**Description:** A young human woman with forgettable features and a talent for disappearing into crowds. She arrived with refugees six weeks ago and secured a position as assistant to Quartermaster Thorne. Her real name is Velxara, and she serves [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] as a poisoner and infiltrator.

**Connection to Primary:** Vex was placed by Covenant handlers to ensure Kragg's success. She communicates with the enemy through signal fires and has killed Commander Aldric to create chaos.

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Rare poison killed Commander | Infirmary | Investigation DC 12 | Saboteur uses exotic methods |
| Quartermaster's assistant asks questions | Barracks | Soldier gossip | Vex as suspect |
| Signal fire on east wall | Patrol reports | Automatic | Saboteur communicates with enemy |
| Vex arrived with refugees | Records | Investigation DC 10 | Vex's cover story |
| Gate mechanism sabotage | Main gate | Automatic Day 2 | Confirm saboteur exists |
| Kragg carries intelligence | Captured Vex | Interrogation | Motivation for capturing Kragg |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. A soldier who deserted three months ago and returned last week (actually genuine, traumatized)
2. Strange packages in Quartermaster Thorne's personal effects (his wife's letters and keepsakes)

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** Vex is not just a saboteur—she genuinely believes [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] serves a higher purpose. If captured, she pleads that the party is on the wrong side, that the "gods of order" have imprisoned something that could set the world free. This foreshadows the Covenant's true nature.

**When It's Revealed:** During interrogation if Vex is captured.

**Impact:** Introduces the Covenant's ideology, sets up future campaign elements, may cause party to question simple good-vs-evil narratives.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Poisoned needle | Commander's chair | Touch | Poison delivery | Perception 18 | 3d6 poison + paralysis |
| Gate sabotage | Main gate mechanism | Use | Gate jammed open/closed | Investigation 15 | N/A (requires 2 hours repair) |
| Water poison | Main well | Drinking | Mass incapacitation | Medicine 16 to detect | Poisoned condition 24 hours |
| Caltrops | Retreat paths | Movement | Slow enemy advance | Perception 12 | 1d4 piercing, speed reduced |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Arrow fire | Outer walls | 1d8 piercing per round exposed | Stay behind cover, suppressing fire |
| Siege engine fire | Anywhere on walls | 3d6 fire, 10-ft radius | Spotters warn 1 round before impact |
| Smoke from fires | Courtyard | Lightly obscured, Constitution save or coughing | Wet cloth over face, stay low |
| Exhaustion | Everywhere | Levels of exhaustion from constant combat | Rotate defenders, short rests |

### Puzzles

#### Repairing the Gate Mechanism
**Location:** Main Gate, gatehouse interior

**Description:** The saboteur has poured molten slag into the gear mechanism. The gate is jammed and cannot open or close properly. The party must repair it while under arrow fire.

**Solution:** Combination of martial and magical approaches:
- Athletics DC 15 to remove slag with tools
- Smith's Tools proficiency grants advantage
- *Mending* cantrip can repair broken gears
- *Heat Metal* can re-soften the slag for removal

**Hints:**
- Sergeant Brennan knows where tools are stored
- The fortress blacksmith can help if found and protected
- The mechanism has redundant systems if one gear set is bypassed

**Bypass Options:** The gate can be barricaded from inside instead (disadvantage: no sorties possible, reduced morale).

| Lead from front vs. command from rear | Personal combat vs. directing troops | Higher personal risk but better morale vs. safer but troops may doubt courage |
| Destroy siege tower vs. poison water supply | Sabotage mission vs. enemy weakening | Tower gone prevents breach vs. weakened enemies easier to fight |
| Kill Vex vs. capture alive | Execution vs. interrogation | Immediate threat ended vs. intelligence gained |
| Accept Kragg's duel challenge | Single combat vs. group fight | Honor and morale vs. tactical advantage |
| Evacuate wounded vs. defend infirmary | Tunnel escape vs. fortress defense | Saves wounded but loses fighters vs. keeps force intact but risks casualties |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Night raids, assassination attempts on enemy commanders, saboteur-style tactics turned against the enemy
- **Diplomacy:** Attempt to negotiate with or bribe the orc mercenaries to switch sides (possible but difficult)
- **Brute Force:** Lead every charge personally, inspiring through martial prowess (high risk, high reward)
- **Deception:** Spread misinformation to the enemy, fake troop numbers, feigned retreats

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- If the gate falls early, defenders retreat to the Tower of Vigilance for a last stand (smaller but more defensible)
- If morale breaks, a core of loyal soldiers remains with the party for desperate defense
- If Kragg wins, the party may be captured and need to escape from a prisoner convoy (sequel adventure)
- If the party falls, reinforcements find the ruins and seek vengeance on Kragg (new party, continuation)

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** Reinforcements from [[Highwall]] arrive to find the Keep battered but standing. Surviving soldiers cheer the party as heroes. Lieutenant Mara is promoted to Commander. The enemy army scatters into the mountains, leaderless. A celebration is held despite the casualties, with the party as honored guests.

**If Failed:** The Keep falls. Survivors either escape through the tunnel or are captured. Enemy forces pour through the mountain pass. [[The Sundered Peaks]] dwarves must defend their borders. The party becomes witnesses to a disaster, survivors who must report the failure and seek another way to stop the Covenant.

**If Partial Success:** The Keep holds but at terrible cost. Fewer than thirty defenders survive. Lieutenant Mara is badly wounded. The party kept the pass closed, but the victory feels pyrrhic. Rebuilding will take months.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- The mountain pass remains secure (if successful), protecting dwarven trade routes
- [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] loses a key military asset but learns the party's capabilities
- [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] invests more resources in eastern defenses
- [[The Grey Wardens]] take interest in the party, suspecting Covenant involvement
- Hobgoblin unity fractures without Kragg's leadership (if he dies)

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. If Kragg survives, he swears vengeance—a future encounter with him better prepared
2. Covenant intelligence documents reveal operations near [[The Citadel of Tears]]—investigation opportunity
3. Vex's belief in the Covenant's righteousness raises questions about what they truly seek
4. The orc mercenaries, if approached, mention other Covenant contracts elsewhere

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Lieutenant Mara | Promoted to Commander, remains grateful ally | Killed defending the gate, or captured |
| Sergeant Brennan | Retires with honor, opens a tavern in [[Highwall]] | Dies holding a breach, remembered as hero |
| Healer Elara | Continues service, researches Covenant poisons | Escapes through tunnel, traumatized but alive |
| Warlord Kragg | Dead or fled with army broken | Victorious, becomes regional threat |
| Vex the Saboteur | Executed, imprisoned, or escaped | Rewarded by Covenant, continues operations |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Track garrison morale as a secondary resource (starts at 10, drops or rises based on events; if it reaches 0, mass surrender)
- Use the "war movie" structure: intense action, then quiet character moments, then action again
- Name individual soldiers who fight alongside the party—their deaths should matter
- Kragg should feel like an intelligent threat: he adapts to party tactics across the three days
- The saboteur investigation should feel urgent but not impossible—leave multiple paths to the truth

### Pacing Suggestions
- Session 1 (Day One): Assassination, war council, first assault, investigation begins
- Session 2 (Day Two): Gate sabotage, night raid on siege tower, unmask saboteur, breach attempt
- Session 3 (Day Three): Giant assault, wyvern attacks, final battle with Kragg, resolution

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to parley with Kragg | He demands surrender; refusal earns grudging respect |
| Attempt to assassinate Kragg early | Layers of security; failure alerts him to the threat |
| Abandon the Keep to guerrilla tactics | Remaining defenders lack leadership, Keep falls by Day Two |
| Focus entirely on the saboteur | Investigation succeeds but defense suffers |
| Split the party for multiple objectives | Risky but potentially rewarding; adjust encounter difficulty |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Reduce enemy numbers by 25%
- Kragg has 80 HP instead of 112
- Add a ballistae on the walls that can target the giant/wyverns
- Provide an NPC wizard ally (battlefield control, no damage)

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add a second Hill Giant
- Kragg has Legendary Resistance (1/day)
- The saboteur has poisoned some of the party's equipment (disadvantage on first roll with affected item)
- Include a Covenant priest who provides healing to enemy leaders

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- Covenant documents mention "the Citadel operations" and "the weakening of the First Seal"
- Vex's rant about "imprisoned truth" and "gods who are jailers" hints at [[The Shackled God]]
- Kragg (if captured/interrogated) reveals he was paid with gold from "the shadow beneath [[Rivergard]]"
- A dying hobgoblin whispers about "what waits in the mountains" before expiring

## Secrets

1. **The True Target:** Kragg's assault is a distraction. While the Keep fights, a smaller Covenant team moves through the mountains toward [[The Sundered Peaks]] seal-point. The party may find evidence of this in captured documents.

2. **Vex's Insurance:** Vex has hidden a second poison cache in the Keep. Even if caught, the poison activates by alchemical timer in 48 hours unless found and disarmed (Investigation DC 18 to locate).

3. **The Commander's Knowledge:** Commander Aldric had discovered evidence of Covenant activity and was about to send warning to [[The Arcane Synod]]. His assassination was specifically timed to prevent this message—the letter is still in his quarters, unsent.

4. **Kragg's Debt:** Warlord Kragg owes his position to the Covenant. They provided him with Sky-Terror, raised from an egg they acquired. If Sky-Terror is killed, Kragg has failed in more than just this battle—his future with the Covenant is over.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. The party was hired to escort supplies to the Grey Keep (delivery becomes desperate defense)
2. Following leads from [[Shadows in the Wood]] revealed Covenant military preparations
3. The party was already at the Keep, investigating rumors of corruption

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **The Sundered Path:** Covenant documents reveal seal-point locations in [[The Sundered Peaks]]—investigation required
2. **The Widow's Hunt:** If Kragg survives, he rebuilds his forces for revenge—pre-emptive strike opportunity
3. **The Traitor's Web:** Vex's handler in [[Rivergard]] must be found before more saboteurs are deployed
4. **The Sealed Gate:** Evidence suggests the attack was timed to match Covenant ritual activity—what happened while the Keep fought?
5. **The Grateful Holds:** Dwarves of [[Ironhold]] wish to reward the party—and ask for help with something in the Deep Roads

## Notes
- This adventure is designed as a pivotal campaign moment—the party's first major military command
- The three-day structure allows for natural session breaks and escalating tension
- Consider having named soldiers assigned to the party who can die meaningfully
- Kragg is designed to be a memorable villain—if he survives, he should return
- The Covenant connection ties this to the larger campaign threat
- Mass combat rules from the DMG can be used for large engagements, or theatre-of-mind with party encounters as focal points
