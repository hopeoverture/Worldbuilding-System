# The Crossed Roads

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A travel encounter bridging the journey from Oakhaven to the Ruins of the Dawn. This adventure can be resolved through combat, negotiation, or cunning, and provides early clues about the Covenant's reach and Captain Varrick's head start.

## Overview
En route to the **Ruins of the Dawn** to intercept the Covenant's retrieval team, the party encounters a blocked bridge on the **Traveler's Way**. A group of bandits known as the "**Red Bandanas**" have set up a roadblock. Usually these outlaws merely demand tolls from travelers, but today they're demanding "offerings for the Mask" and bearing self-inflicted ritual scars. They've been radicalized by a Covenant recruiter and paid by **Captain Varrick** to delay anyone heading toward the ruins.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Ambush / Social Encounter

**Tone:** Gritty / Tense

**Themes:**
- Corruption spreads to the desperate
- The Covenant's far-reaching influence
- Choices have consequences

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** One-Shot (1-2 Hours)

**Party Level:** 2

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Easy-Moderate

**Combat Frequency:** Moderate (One potential combat)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Moderate

**Exploration Emphasis:** Low

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party is traveling the forest road toward the Ruins when they round a bend and find a massive fallen oak blocking the bridge over Whitewater Creek. As they assess the obstacle, figures emerge from the treeline on both sides—bandits with red cloth tied around their arms, bearing crude weapons and fresh scars carved into their forearms.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** Self-motivated (Time pressure to reach the ruins)
**Motivation:** Varrick's team is already at the ruins; every delay matters.
**What They Offer:** N/A

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The Red Bandanas were once mere toll collectors—aggressive but not fanatical.
- These bandits are carving symbols into their own flesh (eye motifs—the Covenant's mark).
- Their leader, Jorry, is shouting about "the Mask" and "the Coming Truth."

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate

**Consequences of Delay:** Every hour of delay gives Varrick more time to breach the ruins.

## Background

### The Situation
**Bandit Captain Jorry** accepted a bag of gold from **Captain Varrick** to block the road and delay any travelers heading toward the ruins. To sweeten the deal, a Covenant cultist named **Brother Silas** was left behind to "enlighten" the bandits. Silas has been feeding them narcotic-laced wine and whispering promises of power. Half the bandits are genuinely converted; the other half are just desperate and scared.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- **Week ago:** Varrick passes through, pays Jorry to block the road.
- **Days ago:** Brother Silas begins his "conversion" of the bandits.
- **Now:** The roadblock is manned by fanatical converts and confused thugs.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Jorry]] (Bandit Captain) | Get rich, impress the "Mask" | Extortion, roadblock |
| [[Brother Silas]] (Cultist) | Delay and convert | Manipulation, poison |
| Unconverted Bandits | Survive, get paid | Follow orders (reluctantly) |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds quickly:** They arrive at the ruins before Varrick breaches the inner sanctum.

**If the party is significantly delayed:** Varrick gains a crucial advantage; the ruins may be partially looted.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Pass the roadblock by any means necessary.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Learn about Varrick's head start (how far ahead is he?).
2. Convince some bandits to abandon the Covenant's cause.
3. Capture or kill Brother Silas (prevents future cult recruitment in the area).

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Jorry has a map showing Varrick's camp location (advantage on approach in Ruins of the Dawn).
2. Brother Silas carries orders signed by "The Silver Mask" (Lord Valerius's alias).

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The party crosses the bridge and continues toward the ruins.

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- Significant delay (captured, long negotiation, etc.) gives Varrick time to complete his breach.
- Party retreat means finding a long alternate route.

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Parley
**Goal:** Assess the situation and find a way through.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Confrontation:** Jorry steps forward, demanding "offerings for the Mask." He's erratic, pupils dilated (drugged).
2. **The Assessment:** The party can observe that not all bandits seem committed—some look scared, some look confused.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The bandits mention a "well-armored captain" who passed through days ago, heading the same direction.
- Brother Silas lurks in the back, watching, occasionally whispering to Jorry.

**Transition to Act 2:** Depending on party approach—negotiation, intimidation, or violence.

### Act 2: The Resolution
**Goal:** Clear the road through combat, persuasion, or deception.

**Key Scenes (Choose One Path):**

**Path A - Combat:**
1. **The Ambush Reversed:** If the party attacks, the bandits fight but some flee quickly.
2. **Brother Silas Flees:** The cultist attempts to escape into the woods if combat goes poorly.

**Path B - Persuasion:**
1. **Reaching Jorry:** A DC 15 Persuasion check can make Jorry realize he's being used. His "conversion" is recent and shallow.
2. **Turning the Bandits:** Pointing out the Covenant's manipulation can cause half the bandits to stand down.

**Path C - Deception:**
1. **Fake Offering:** Pretending to have Covenant business ("We're also servants of the Mask") can confuse Jorry.
2. **Poison the Poisoner:** Swapping Brother Silas's drugged wine for something worse.

**Rising Tension:** Brother Silas begins chanting if negotiations stall, trying to trigger violence.

**Midpoint Twist:** One of the bandits (young, scared) might approach the party secretly, offering to help if they promise not to kill him.

**Transition to Act 3:** Resolution and aftermath.

### Act 3: The Aftermath
**Goal:** Gather information and continue the journey.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Search:** Jorry's body/belongings contain a map showing Varrick's route and camp location.
2. **The Interrogation:** Brother Silas (if captured) reveals little, but his orders mention "the Silver Mask."

**Climactic Encounter:** If not resolved earlier, a final confrontation with Brother Silas, who may summon a **Shadow** as a last resort.

**Resolution Options:**
- Combat victory: Road cleared, some intel obtained.
- Negotiation victory: Bandits disperse, more intel obtained, Silas may escape.
- Deception victory: Party passes without alerting Silas, preserving surprise.

## Locations

### Overview Map
The Traveler's Way cuts through the Westmark forest. Whitewater Creek runs beneath a stone bridge. The "fallen" oak is actually dragged into place—not a natural collapse.

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[The Travelers Way]] - Whitewater Bridge

**Description:** A narrow stone bridge over a swift forest stream. The surrounding woods are thick with autumn foliage, providing excellent concealment for ambushers.

**Key Features:**
- **The Fallen Oak:** Deliberately placed; can be moved with DC 20 Athletics (or burned/chopped).
- **The Treeline:** Bandits hiding on both sides; partial cover.
- **The Bridge:** 15 feet wide, 30 feet long; falling into the creek is non-lethal but cold.

**Encounters Here:** Bandit roadblock.

### Location 2: The Bandit Camp
**Description:** A rough camp 200 feet off the road, hidden in a clearing. Tents, campfire, and a makeshift "shrine" to the Unveiled Truth.

**Key Features:**
- **The Shrine:** A rock with a painted eye; offerings of blood surround it.
- **Silas's Tent:** Contains his orders, ritual components, and the drugged wine.

**Encounters Here:** Only if party investigates after combat.

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| [[Oakhaven]] | The Roadblock | Half-day | None |
| The Roadblock | [[Ruins of the Dawn]] | Half-day | Possible Varrick scouts |

## Key NPCs

### Allies (Potential)

#### Young Bandit (Tam)
**Role:** Potential informant

**Description:** A skinny teenager with wide, frightened eyes. He joined the bandits out of hunger, not malice.

**Personality:** Scared, regretful, looking for a way out.

**What They Want:** To escape this situation alive.

**What They Know:** Where Silas keeps his orders; which bandits are true converts vs. coerced.

**How They Can Help:** Can cause a distraction, reveal weak points, or lead party around the roadblock.

### Neutrals

#### Unconverted Bandits (4)
**Role:** Coerced participants

**Description:** Rough men and women who signed up for robbery, not cult activity.

**Personality:** Uncomfortable, afraid of both the party and Silas.

**What They Want:** Money and survival.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Will surrender or flee if the fight turns against them.

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: [[Bandit Captain Jorry]]
**Role:** Roadblock leader

**Description:** A heavyset man with a bushy beard and wild eyes. Fresh cuts in the shape of eyes mark his forearms. He speaks too fast, laughs at odd moments—clearly under the influence.

**Personality:** Unstable, paranoid, but not beyond reason. The drug clouds his judgment.

**Motivation:** Greed and the promise of power from "the Mask."

**Methods:** Intimidation, numbers, and the threat of the "Mask's vengeance."

**Weakness:** His conversion is shallow; genuine reasoning can shake him. The drug makes him suggestible.

**Combat Notes:** Use **Bandit Captain** stats. Fights recklessly; doesn't retreat until bloodied.

#### Secondary Antagonist: [[Brother Silas]]
**Role:** Cult handler / True believer

**Description:** A thin man in travel-stained robes with a calm, patient smile that never reaches his cold eyes. No visible weapons, but his hands are stained with ritual ink.

**Personality:** Quietly fanatical, condescending, utterly convinced of his cause.

**Motivation:** Spread the Covenant's influence; delay anyone pursuing Varrick.

**Methods:** Manipulation, drugged wine, summoning magic as a last resort.

**Weakness:** Cowardly in direct combat; will flee or surrender if cornered.

**Combat Notes:** Use **Cultist** stats; can cast *Command* once and summon a **Shadow** once (takes 1 round to complete).

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Roadblock Fight
**Location:** Whitewater Bridge

**Trigger:** Party refuses demands and initiates combat, or negotiations fail badly.

**Location:** The Roadblock

**NPCs Present:** Jorry, Silas, Bandits

**Stakes:** Passage without combat; information about Varrick.

**Information Available:**

| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 15 | Jorry doubts Silas; half bandits stand down | Jorry grows paranoid |
| Intimidation | 14 | Bandits hesitate; Jorry must make a decision | Jorry attacks out of fear |
| Insight | 12 | Recognize Jorry is drugged; can be exploited | Miss the signs |
| Deception | 13 | Convince Jorry you're Covenant allies | Silas sees through it |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Jorry turns on Silas; bandits scatter; party gains map and info.
- Moderate: Bandits stand down; Silas flees; party passes.
- Worst: Negotiations collapse into combat.

#### Convincing Young Tam
**Location:** Edges of the roadblock

**NPCs Present:** Tam (hiding in the treeline)

**Stakes:** Inside help, information.

**Information Available:**
- Which bandits are true believers (only 2—Jorry and one other).
- Where the camp is.
- That Silas has "papers from someone important."

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 10 | Tam helps willingly | Tam is too scared to act |
| Intimidation | 12 | Tam helps out of fear | Tam runs and alerts others |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Tam guides the party around the roadblock or causes a distraction.
- Worst: Tam alerts the bandits; element of surprise lost.

### Exploration Challenges

#### Searching the Bandit Camp
**Location:** Hidden camp off the road

**Description:** A crude camp with tents, a fire pit, and a disturbing shrine.

**Skills Useful:** Investigation (DC 12) to find Silas's tent; Perception (DC 14) to notice the hidden lockbox.

**Hazards:** If Silas escaped, he may have left a trap (poisoned needle, DC 13 to spot, 2d6 poison damage).

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Silas's orders (clue about Lord Valerius).
- 30 gp in a lockbox.
- Drugged wine (can be used as poison or evidence).

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| "Armored captain" ahead | Jorry | Negotiation or interrogation | Confirms Varrick's presence |
| Map to Varrick's camp | Jorry's body/belongings | Search | Advantage in Ruins of the Dawn |
| Orders from "Silver Mask" | Silas's tent | Search | Hints at Lord Valerius |
| Covenant is recruiting criminals | Observation | Insight check | Understanding the threat's scope |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. The bandits claim the "Mask" will punish anyone who harms them (empty threat).
2. Silas hints at "reinforcements coming" (bluff—no one is coming).

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The bandits are more victims than villains—desperate people manipulated by the Covenant.

**When It's Revealed:** When a party member succeeds on an Insight check to notice Jorry's drugged state, or when Tam approaches.

**Impact:** Shifts the moral calculation; the party may try to save the bandits rather than kill them.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Poison Needle | Silas's Lockbox | Opening without check | Poisoned | DEX 14 | 2d6 poison |
| Trip Wire | Path to camp | Walking | Bell alarm | PER 12 | None (alerts camp) |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Swift Creek | Below bridge | Swept 30 ft. downstream if fallen | Swim DC 10 |
| Dense Foliage | Around road | Difficult terrain; half cover | Ignore with Survival |

### Puzzles

#### Moving the Oak
**Location:** The bridge

**Description:** The massive fallen oak blocks passage. It was dragged here, not naturally fallen.

**Solution:** DC 20 Athletics (multiple party members can Help), chop through (10 minutes), burn it (risky—may spread), or find an alternate path through the woods.

**Hints:**
- Drag marks are visible (Investigation DC 10).
- The oak's roots were cut, not torn.

**Bypass Options:** Tam can show a game trail that goes around (adds 30 minutes).

## Rewards

### Treasure

#### Monetary
**Total Value:** 80 gp

**Distribution:**
| Location | Contents | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Jorry's pouch | Extorted tolls | 50 gp |
| Bandit camp lockbox | Varrick's payment | 30 gp |

#### Magic Items
| Item | Location | Guarded By |
|------|----------|------------|
| None | — | — |

### Quest Rewards
**From Quest Giver:** None (self-motivated).

**Additional Rewards:**
- Jorry's Map: Advantage on Survival checks to approach the ruins and locate Varrick's camp.
- Silas's Orders: Documentary evidence of the Covenant's network; useful later.

### Experience
**Combat XP:** ~200 XP (if full combat).

**Non-Combat XP:** 100 XP for resolving without bloodshed.

**Milestone Advancement:** Partial progress toward Level 3.

### Intangible Rewards
- **Reputation:** Sparing the bandits earns goodwill with any survivors; killing them all earns a "ruthless" reputation.
- **Allies Gained:** Tam may reappear as a reformed NPC later.
- **Information Learned:** Varrick's location; the Covenant's recruitment methods.
- **Story Hooks:** "The Silver Mask" is mentioned—who is this mysterious figure?

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| How to pass | Fight / Talk / Sneak | Speed vs. information vs. moral standing |
| Spare or kill Jorry | Spare / Kill | Potential future ally or enemy eliminated |
| Deal with Silas | Capture / Kill / Let escape | Intel vs. future problems |
| Help Tam | Yes / No | Potential ally gained or lost |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Can sneak around (Tam helps; adds 30 minutes travel).
- **Diplomacy:** Can talk down Jorry; gain max intel.
- **Brute Force:** Fast but gains less information.
- **Deception:** Pretend to be Covenant; risky but creative.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- If captured, the party can escape when the bandits get distracted by Silas's chanting.
- If they flee, they can find another route (adds half a day, but they still reach the ruins).

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful (Quick):** The party continues to the Ruins with Varrick's location in hand.

**If Delayed:** Varrick has more time; the party arrives to find him already inside the Ruins.

**If Bandits Spared:** Word spreads that the party is merciful; may help with future social encounters.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- If Silas escapes, he reports to the Covenant; they know the party is coming.
- If Silas is captured, the Covenant loses an agent in the region.
- If Tam is helped, he may appear later as a reformed informant.

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. Who is "The Silver Mask"? (Lord Valerius, revealed later)
2. Where did the Covenant recruit Silas? (A larger cult network)

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| [[Jorry]] | Killed, captured, or freed | Continues blocking road |
| [[Brother Silas]] | Captured, killed, or escaped | Reports to Covenant |
| [[Tam]] | Freed, potential ally | Remains trapped with bandits |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Play Jorry as unstable but not unreachable—he's a man in over his head.
- Silas should be sinister and calm, a contrast to Jorry's erratic behavior.
- Let the party's approach dictate the pace; this can be a fast combat or a tense negotiation.

### Pacing Suggestions
- The confrontation should build tension quickly—the party is on a clock.
- If negotiations drag, have Silas start chanting to force a decision.
- Keep the aftermath brief; the party should feel urgency to continue.

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Attack immediately | Combat begins; some bandits flee quickly |
| Try to negotiate | Jorry is receptive but Silas undermines |
| Look for another route | Tam approaches, offers help |
| Pretend to be Covenant | Silas demands proof; high Deception DC |
| Target Silas first | Smart! He's the true threat |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:** Remove 2 bandits; Silas's Shadow doesn't manifest properly (half HP).

**For Stronger Parties:** Add 2 bandits; Silas successfully summons the Shadow before combat ends.

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- The orders mentioning "The Silver Mask" plant the seed for Lord Valerius's reveal.
- Varrick is established as a dangerous, organized opponent.
- The Covenant's recruitment of criminals shows their amoral methods.

## Secrets

1. Silas reports directly to Lord Valerius; his capture would be a significant intelligence coup.
2. The drugged wine contains a mild hallucinogen that makes subjects suggestible—standard Covenant recruitment technique.
3. Jorry was once a decent man who fell into banditry after losing his farm to taxes; he can be redeemed.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. The party follows the clues from The Silent Bell pointing to the Ruins of the Dawn.
2. The Letter from the Silver Mask mentions a "retrieval team" heading to the ruins.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. Direct continuation to **Ruins of the Dawn** with or without Varrick's map.
2. If Silas escapes, he reappears as a recurring antagonist.
3. The "Silver Mask" mystery leads eventually to Lord Valerius.

## Notes
This adventure serves as a transition between the investigation in Oakhaven and the dungeon crawl at the Ruins. It establishes that the Covenant has reach beyond the main plotline and introduces Varrick as a tangible opponent. The encounter can be resolved in many ways, rewarding player creativity.
