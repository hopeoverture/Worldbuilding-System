> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
To repair the weakening seals, the party needs the **Sunstone**, a relic created by the Architects of Dawn. Ancient texts recovered from the Ruins of the Dawn point to the **Shrine of the Morning**, hidden deep within the mist-shrouded **Valdris Vale**. There, the party must prove their worthiness to the ancient guardian—a Sphinx named **Isandria**—by passing trials of Courage, Wisdom, and Sacrifice.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Puzzle Dungeon / Trial

**Tone:** Mythic / Cerebral

**Themes:**
- The weight of history
- Worthiness and virtue
- Knowledge as power

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 2 Sessions

**Party Level:** 6

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate

**Combat Frequency:** Low

**Roleplay Emphasis:** High

**Exploration Emphasis:** High

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party's ally (Scholar/Mage) translates the final runes on the Dawn Key: *"Only the pure of heart may bear the Light."* The Key vibrates, acting as a compass pointing south to the Vale.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** The Dawn Key (Artifact) / [[Master Elodin]]

### Initial Information
- The Shrine is protected by powerful illusion magic.
- It was a testing ground for the first Paladins of the Architects.

## Background

### The Situation
The Covenant knows the shrine exists but cannot enter; their malice triggers the outer defenses (deadly solar lasers). They are camped outside, trying to corrupt the wards.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Isandria]] (Gynosphinx) | Test the worthy | Riddles and illusions |
| [[Covenant Siege Commander]] | Breached the shrine | Dark rituals (failing) |

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Pass the three trials and claim the **Sunstone**.

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Barrier
**Goal:** Breach the Covenant blockade and enter the Shrine.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **The Mist:** Navigating the magical fog that confuses directional sense.
2.  **The Camp:** A stealth mission to bypass the frustrated Covenant forces blasting the door.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The Covenant is getting desperate; they are summoning demons to try and brute force the door.

**Transition to Act 2:** Using the Dawn Key to open the massive golden gates.

### Act 2: The Three Trials
**Goal:** Prove worthiness.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **Trial of Courage:** The room goes pitch black. Players fight "Shadows" of their worst fears (Roleplay/Combat). The only way to win is to not attack, but to walk forward.
2.  **Trial of Wisdom:** A giant chessboard or riddle room presided over by Isandria.
3.  **Trial of Sacrifice:** A magical scale. Players must place something of true value (a magic item, a memory, hit points) to balance the feather of truth.

**Rising Tension:** The Covenant breaches the outer door and starts fighting the temple's constructs behind the party.

**Midpoint Twist:** Isandria reveals she is dying/fading; she *needs* them to succeed so she can pass on her burden.

**Transition to Act 3:** The Inner Sanctum.

### Act 3: The Inheritance
**Goal:** Claim the stone and defend it.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **The Bestowal:** Isandria gives the **Sunstone**.
2.  **The Breach:** The Covenant commander breaks in with a **Glabrezu** (Demon).

**Climactic Encounter:** Party + Isandria (weakened) vs. Commander (Blackguard) + Glabrezu.

**Resolution Options:**
- Defeat the intruders. Isandria fades away, leaving the shrine's stewardship to the party.

## Locations

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[Shrine of the Morning]]

**Description:** A pristine sanctuary of white marble and gold, seemingly untouched by the centuries. It feels "outside of time."

**Key Features:**
- **The Solar Hall:** Lit by a miniature sun.
- **The Pool of Reflection:** Shows the past.

## Key NPCs

### Allies (Potential)
