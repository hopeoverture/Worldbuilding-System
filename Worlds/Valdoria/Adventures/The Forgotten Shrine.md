# The Forgotten Shrine

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
To repair the weakening seals that bind [[The Shackled God]], the party must claim the **Sunstone**—a legendary relic forged by the Architects of Dawn from the crystallized heart of a Solar angel. Ancient texts recovered during [[Ruins of the Dawn]] point to the **Shrine of the Morning**, a sacred temple hidden deep within the mist-shrouded [[The Valdris Vale|Valdris Vale]]. But [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] has besieged the shrine's outer gates, desperate to claim or destroy the artifact before heroes can wield it against them. The party must bypass the blockade, prove their worthiness to the ancient guardian—a gynosphinx named **Isandria** who has watched over the shrine for three millennia—by passing the Trials of Courage, Wisdom, and Sacrifice, and then defend their prize against a demonic assault.

**Exploration Emphasis:** High

## The Hook

### How It Begins
Following the party's success at [[Ruins of the Dawn]], their ally—[[Master Elodin]] of the [[The Arcane Synod|Arcane Synod]] or a scholar who translated the recovered texts—reveals what the **Dawn Key** unlocks: the path to the Sunstone. As the scholar finishes the translation, the Dawn Key begins to pulse with warm golden light, acting as a compass pointing south toward the mist-shrouded vale. "Only the pure of heart may bear the Light," the runes declare. "Only the worthy shall pass the Guardian's gaze."

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Master Elodin]] / The Dawn Key (Artifact)
**Motivation:** Master Elodin believes the Sunstone is humanity's best hope against the Covenant's seal-breaking operations. The Dawn Key itself seems to compel the bearer toward the shrine, as if the ancient Architects anticipated this moment.
**What They Offer:** Elodin provides maps of the Valdris Vale's hidden paths, information about the Shrine's legendary trials, and a warning: the Covenant's agents are already there.

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The Shrine of the Morning is protected by powerful illusion magic that confuses directional sense—the Dawn Key can pierce these mists.
- It was a testing ground for the first Paladins of the Architects, designed to judge worthiness.
- The Guardian is a Sphinx who has judged seekers for three thousand years—very few have passed.
- [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] knows the shrine exists but their malice triggers the outer defenses. They've been trying to breach it with dark rituals for weeks.

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate (Critical if delayed)

**Consequences of Delay:** The Covenant has summoned a Glabrezu demon to breach the shrine's doors. Every day the party delays increases the demon's progress. If the party takes more than three days after learning of the shrine, the Covenant breaches during Act 2 rather than Act 3, significantly complicating the trials.

## Background

### The Situation
The Shrine of the Morning has stood inviolate for three millennia, protected by wards keyed to detect malice and corruption. [[Commander Kael]], a fallen paladin serving [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]], has established a siege camp outside the shrine's entrance. His forces have tried brute force, dark rituals, and even negotiation—all have failed. The shrine's solar wards burn anyone approaching with evil intent. In desperation, Kael has summoned a weakened Glabrezu demon to batter down the golden gates. The demon's assault is slowly working, each impact cracking the ancient protections. Inside, Isandria—the last of the Architect's guardians—watches her wards fail inch by inch. She has waited three thousand years for worthy champions. Time is running out.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- **3,000 years ago:** The Architects of Dawn built the Shrine as a repository for the Sunstone and a testing ground for those who would wield holy power against the darkness. They appointed Isandria, a gynosphinx, as eternal guardian.
- **The Age of Myth ends:** The Architects vanished or ascended, leaving their creations behind. The Shrine passed into legend.
- **500 years ago:** [[The Prophet of Chains]] learned of the Sunstone through communion with [[The Shackled God]]. The Covenant has sought it ever since.
- **Three weeks ago:** Covenant scouts finally located the Shrine using stolen Architect maps.
- **One week ago:** Commander Kael established his siege camp after his vanguard was incinerated by the wards.
- **Three days ago:** Kael summoned a Glabrezu, binding it with promises of carnage.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Isandria]] (Gynosphinx) | Test the worthy and pass on her burden before death | The Three Trials—ancient tests of virtue |
| [[Commander Kael]] (Blackguard) | Claim or destroy the Sunstone for the Covenant | Demonic brute force; will desecrate the shrine if he cannot possess it |
| The Glabrezu | Feed on mortal suffering and escape its binding | Follows Kael's orders but seeks opportunities for cruelty |
| [[Master Elodin]] | Acquire the Sunstone to reinforce the prison seals | Relies entirely on the party's success |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:**
- The party gains the Sunstone, a powerful artifact for fighting the Covenant and reinforcing the seals.
- Isandria's millennia of vigilance ends peacefully; she passes her sacred duty to new champions.
- The Covenant loses their chance to destroy or corrupt a major holy artifact.
- The [[The Order of the Silver Flame|Order of the Silver Flame]] gains hope that the divine has not abandoned the mortal world.

**If the party fails:**
- The Glabrezu destroys or corrupts the Sunstone, eliminating a major weapon against the Shackled God.
- Isandria dies in despair, her vigil ended in failure.
- Commander Kael's success emboldens the Covenant's operations across the continent.
- The weakening seals lose their best hope of reinforcement.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Pass the three Trials of the Guardian—Courage, Wisdom, and Sacrifice—and claim the **Sunstone** from the Inner Sanctum.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. **Defeat Commander Kael** rather than allowing him to escape—his death deals a significant blow to Covenant operations in the Vale.
2. **Preserve Isandria's wisdom** by asking her about the Architects, the seals, and the true nature of the Shackled God before she fades.
3. **Recover Architect texts** from the shrine's library for the Arcane Synod.
4. **Free the Glabrezu's captive souls** trapped within its form (requires specific actions during the final battle).

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. **Learn Isandria's secret**—she is one of the Architects' companions/pets, left behind when they departed. She knows things about the Shackled God that no mortal text records.
2. **Discover the Sunstone's true nature**—it is the crystallized heart of a Solar angel who volunteered for sacrifice. Speaking to it during the Trial of Sacrifice reveals its name: Solarius.

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The party claims the Sunstone intact.
- The shrine is not desecrated (Kael and the demon defeated or driven off).

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- All party members die or flee before claiming the Sunstone.
- The Glabrezu destroys the Sunstone before the party can claim it.
- The party fails all three trials (Isandria offers one retry per trial; a second failure on the same trial ends the attempt).

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Barrier
**Goal:** Bypass the Covenant blockade and enter the Shrine.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Wandering Mist:** The party enters the Valdris Vale's mist-shrouded interior, where powerful illusions confuse direction and loop travelers back on themselves. The Dawn Key glows to show the true path, but straying from its light means hours of wandering. Perception DC 15 to notice they're being watched; Covenant scouts trail any group heading toward the shrine.
2. **The Siege Camp:** A clearing before the shrine's golden gates reveals Commander Kael's operation: twenty cultists in a fortified camp, a massive summoning circle containing a partially-materialized Glabrezu battering the gates, and Kael himself directing the assault. The party can approach via stealth (group Stealth vs. passive Perception 12), create a distraction (limited only by creativity), or launch a direct assault (very difficult at this stage).
3. **The Golden Gates:** Massive gates of white-gold metal stand thirty feet high, carved with scenes of angels at war. The Dawn Key fits a central lock—but using it while the camp is active alerts every Covenant soldier. Clever parties will neutralize or bypass the camp first.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The Covenant is getting desperate. Kael has been besieging for a week with no progress. The Glabrezu is his last resort, and its binding is unstable.
- Overheard conversation: "The Prophet says the Light-Bearer must not reach the shrine. Kill them all, desecrate the temple, destroy the stone—whatever it takes."
- The cultists fear the shrine's defenses. Two soldiers who approached the gates too closely were incinerated by "holy fire."

**Transition to Act 2:** The party uses the Dawn Key to open the golden gates. As they swing inward, revealing pristine white marble halls, a calm female voice speaks in their minds: *"Seekers. At last. Enter, and be judged."*

### Act 2: The Three Trials
**Goal:** Prove worthiness through the ancient tests of Courage, Wisdom, and Sacrifice.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Entrance Hall:** A vast chamber of white marble and gold, impossibly preserved. Sunlight streams through crystal skylights though the party entered at night. At the far end, upon a raised dais, sits **Isandria**—a massive lioness with eagle wings and a wise, ancient human face, wearing a golden headdress that gleams with inner light. She speaks without moving her lips: *"Three thousand years I have waited. Many have come seeking the Light. All have failed. Will you be different?"* She explains the trials and warns: one chance per trial, then a second if the first is failed. Fail twice on any trial, and the shrine closes forever to that seeker.

2. **Trial of Courage (The Shadow Hall):** The party enters a chamber that plunges into absolute darkness—even darkvision fails. From the darkness emerge manifestations of each character's deepest fears: a dead loved one returned wrong, a moment of failure replayed, the face of a nemesis. These **Shadow Fears** have the statistics of Shadows but cannot actually harm the party—their attacks deal psychic damage but this damage is illusory, vanishing when the trial ends. The trial's secret: *the only way to win is to stop fighting and walk forward through the darkness*. Characters who attack their fears find them multiplying. Characters who speak words of acceptance or simply advance despite terror find the shadows parting. When the last character stops fighting and walks forward, the chamber floods with light and a door opens.
   - **Hint (Isandria's riddle):** *"In darkness, the warrior's blade finds nothing. Only by walking blind does one reach the light."*
   - **Alternative Success:** A character who realizes the truth can call out to their companions. A DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check to understand, or DC 14 Intelligence (Religion) to recognize the structure of virtue tests.

3. **Trial of Wisdom (The Riddle Chamber):** A massive chamber contains a giant chessboard-like floor, sixty-four squares of alternating gold and silver. Isandria's voice presents three riddles, each requiring the party to stand on specific squares to indicate their answer (letters correspond to squares). Wrong answers trigger magical traps—lightning bolts, force walls, or teleportation.
   - **Riddle 1:** *"I am always coming but never arrive. I am never here but always near. What am I?"* Answer: TOMORROW (stand on T-O-M-O-R-R-O-W squares)
   - **Riddle 2:** *"The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?"* Answer: FOOTSTEPS
   - **Riddle 3:** *"I can fly without wings. I can cry without eyes. Whenever I go, darkness flies. What am I?"* Answer: LIGHT or SUNLIGHT
   - **Alternative:** A DC 18 Intelligence check allows a character to perceive the underlying logic of the puzzle. DC 20 Arcana reveals the answers encoded in the chamber's architecture.

4. **Trial of Sacrifice (The Scales of Truth):** The final trial chamber contains a massive golden scale, one pan holding a white feather, the other empty. Isandria's voice speaks: *"To bear the Light, you must give something of true worth. Not gold, which passes. Not flesh, which heals. Place upon the scale that which you will truly miss, and the feather shall rise."*
   - **Acceptable sacrifices:** A treasured magic item (attuned items weigh more on the scales), genuine memories (character may choose to forget a meaningful NPC or event—mechanically reflected by the player), a portion of one's life force (permanent -2 HP maximum), a vow that binds (sworn before the scale, a geas-like effect), or a confession of a secret shame (grants the shrine permanent knowledge of that secret).
   - **The Test's Truth:** The scale measures *willingness*, not material value. A character who genuinely offers something precious succeeds even if the item seems minor. A character who offers something "expensive" but meaningless to them fails.
   - **Deepest Sacrifice:** If a character offers to take Isandria's place as guardian, the scale rises instantly. Isandria will tearfully refuse but grants that character her personal blessing (+1 to Wisdom saving throws permanently).

**Rising Tension:** As the party completes each trial, tremors shake the shrine. The Glabrezu's assault intensifies. Between trials, Isandria grows visibly weaker, her form flickering. After the second trial, a BOOM echoes through the halls—the outer gates have fallen.

**Midpoint Twist:** Before the Trial of Sacrifice, Isandria speaks privately to the character who showed the most virtue in previous trials: *"I must tell you truth. I am dying. Not from age—I am beyond age—but because my purpose ends. For three thousand years I have waited for those who could carry the Light. If you succeed... I can finally rest. My creators are gone. I am the last. Please... be worthy."*

**Transition to Act 3:** The scales balance. The door to the Inner Sanctum opens. But so does the main hall—the Covenant has breached the shrine.

### Act 3: The Inheritance
**Goal:** Claim the Sunstone and defend the shrine from desecration.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Solar Hall / Inner Sanctum:** A domed chamber of impossible beauty. In the center, a miniature sun orbits a crystal pedestal, bathing everything in warm golden light. Upon the pedestal rests the **Sunstone**—a fist-sized gem of brilliant yellow-gold that pulses like a heartbeat. The Pool of Reflection nearby shows images of the past: the Architects at work, the sealing of the Shackled God, and Isandria's long vigil. Isandria enters behind the party: *"You have proven worthy. The Light is yours. But you must take it—I cannot give it. Reach out, and accept the burden."* The character who reaches for the Sunstone must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be overwhelmed by the Solar's memories for one round (incapacitated). Success means a controlled vision: the Solar Solarius *chose* this fate, sacrificing immortality to create a weapon against ultimate darkness. The vision ends with his voice: *"Use me well."*

2. **The Breach:** The moment the Sunstone is claimed, the chamber shakes. The doors blast open. Commander Kael strides in, black plate armor splashed with the blood of his own fallen soldiers (the shrine's inner defenses killed many). Behind him, squeezing through the doorway, comes the **Glabrezu**—twelve feet of demonic muscle, pincers clicking. "The Prophet sends his regards," Kael snarls. "That stone belongs to the Void. Give it up and I'll make your deaths quick."

3. **Climactic Encounter: The Desecration:**
   - **Battlefield:** The Solar Hall—60 ft. diameter dome. Central pedestal (now empty). Pool of Reflection (difficult terrain, 10 ft. diameter). Pillars of light (bright light, provide half cover). The miniature sun (hovers 20 ft. up, can be called down once by whoever holds the Sunstone—see below).
   - **Allies:** Isandria (Gynosphinx, but weakened—use half HP). She fights to protect the party but prioritizes defense, using her spells to hinder enemies.
   - **Enemies:** Commander Kael (Blackguard, CR 5—use Veteran stat block with Divine Smite: +2d8 necrotic on hit 3/day), Glabrezu (CR 9, but weakened—use standard stats but half HP, or use young glabrezu variant).
   - **Tactics:** Kael engages the strongest-looking martial character, smiting viciously. The Glabrezu targets whoever holds the Sunstone, using its pincers to grapple and its Confusion ability to scatter the party. If the Sunstone is dropped, the Glabrezu spends an action trying to destroy it (requires two such actions to shatter it).
   - **The Sunstone's Power:** The character holding the Sunstone can use an action to call down the miniature sun, dealing 4d6 radiant damage to all enemies in a 20 ft. radius (DC 15 Dex save for half). This can only be done once.

**Resolution Options:**
- **Total Victory:** Both Kael and the Glabrezu are destroyed. The shrine is preserved. Isandria, satisfied, addresses the party: *"It is done. The Light passes to new bearers. I can rest."* She fades into golden motes that drift upward, joining the miniature sun. The shrine falls silent but remains sacred.
- **Partial Victory:** Kael or the Glabrezu escapes, but the Sunstone is secured. Isandria still fades, but warns: *"The darkness knows your faces now. Be wary."*
- **Pyrrhic Victory:** The party defeats the enemies but one or more members died, or Isandria was killed before she could fade peacefully. The Sunstone is secured, but at great cost.
- **Failure:** The Glabrezu destroys the Sunstone or the party is wiped out. The shrine is desecrated. This should only happen if the party makes very poor decisions or is extremely unlucky.

## Locations

### Overview Map
The Shrine of the Morning lies at the heart of the Valdris Vale, accessible only through mist-shrouded paths. Outside the golden gates is a natural clearing (the siege camp). Inside, a linear progression: Entrance Hall, Trial of Courage chamber, Trial of Wisdom chamber, Trial of Sacrifice chamber, and finally the Solar Hall.

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[Shrine of the Morning]]

**Description:** A pristine sanctuary of white marble and gold, seemingly untouched by the passage of three millennia. The architecture defies the local style—smooth curves, golden filigree, and crystal that captures light in impossible ways. Time feels different here; the air carries the faint scent of dawn flowers that haven't bloomed in centuries. Dust refuses to settle. Shadows seem thinner, less oppressive.

**Key Features:**
- **The Golden Gates:** Thirty feet high, warded against evil, depicting the War of Light and Shadow.
- **The Entrance Hall:** Where Isandria holds court, with walls showing the history of the Architects.
- **The Solar Hall:** The inner sanctum, lit by a miniature sun, containing the Sunstone.
- **The Pool of Reflection:** Shows visions of the past to those who gaze into it (DC 12 Wisdom save or be transfixed for 1 round).

**Encounters Here:** The Three Trials, Final Boss Battle

### Location 2: The Siege Camp
**Description:** A hastily fortified encampment of black tents bearing the Covenant's broken-circle symbol. A massive summoning circle dominates the center, anchored by iron spikes driven into the earth. The air reeks of brimstone and corruption.

**Key Features:**
- **Command Tent:** Kael's quarters, containing orders from the Prophet and maps of the region.
- **Summoning Circle:** Contains the partially-manifested Glabrezu; disrupting the circle releases the demon uncontrolled.
- **Supply Wagons:** Food, weapons, and ritual components. Also contains three prisoners (local farmers who wandered too close).

**Encounters Here:** Stealth/Social bypass, potential combat

### Location 3: The Mist Paths
**Description:** The heart of the Valdris Vale is choked with supernatural mist that loops travelers endlessly. Sound carries strangely; echoes of ancient voices whisper at the edge of hearing.

**Key Features:**
- **The Loops:** Without the Dawn Key's guidance, travelers find themselves back where they started after hours of walking.
- **The Watchers:** Covenant scouts patrol the mist's edges, looking for anyone heading toward the shrine.
- **The Memory Pools:** Occasional clearings with still water that show visions of the past.

**Encounters Here:** Navigation challenge, potential ambush

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Nearest settlement | Mist edge | 1 day | Covenant patrols |
| Mist edge | Shrine (with Key) | 4 hours | Mist illusions, scouts |
| Mist edge | Shrine (without Key) | Infinite | Cannot be navigated |
| Siege Camp | Golden Gates | 100 feet | Open ground, guards |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### [[Isandria]]
**Role:** Guardian Sphinx / Trial Administrator

**Description:** A massive gynosphinx—a lioness the size of a horse with great eagle wings and a noble human woman's face, ancient and beautiful and sad. She wears a golden headdress worked with the sun-symbol of the Architects, and her eyes hold the weight of three thousand years of solitary vigil. Her voice speaks directly into minds, calm and measured, with the faint echo of many voices speaking in harmony.

**Personality:** Stern but sorrowful; patient beyond mortal comprehension but secretly desperate. She has watched the world decay, seen countless seekers fail her trials, and feels the shrine's wards failing under the demonic assault. She wants to believe these newcomers are different. She is afraid to hope.

**What They Want:** To pass on her burden to worthy successors before she fades from existence. To know that her three millennia of vigilance meant something.

**What They Know:**
- The Sunstone's true nature as a Solar's crystallized heart.
- The original sealing of the Shackled God and the Architects' role in it.
- That the seals are weakening and the Covenant is close to success.
- That the Silver Flame (divine force, not organization) is connected to the same power that created the shrine.

**How They Can Help:** Administers the trials fairly but offers hints to those who show promise. In the final battle, she fights as an ally (weakened—half HP). Her Roar ability can frighten enemies, and her spells provide support.

### Neutrals

#### The Shrine Spirits
**Role:** Ambient witnesses

**Description:** Faint impressions of the Architects who once walked these halls—more like memories than ghosts. They observe but do not interact except through the Pool of Reflection.

**Personality:** Distant, ancient, beyond mortal concerns.

**What They Want:** Unknown—they may no longer want anything.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Curious observation. If a party member succeeds spectacularly at a trial, the spirits may offer a whispered blessing (+1 to a single roll).

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: [[Commander Kael]]
**Role:** Covenant Blackguard / Siege Commander

**Description:** A fallen paladin in his forties, Kael once served [[The Order of the Silver Flame]] before the death of his family during a Covenant attack led him to despair and, eventually, to their ranks. He wears black plate armor etched with the Covenant's broken-circle symbol, and wields a bastard sword that burns with necrotic flame. His face is handsome but hollow, with dead eyes that have seen too much and believe in nothing except power. He serves the Prophet not from faith but from nihilism—if the world will not be just, let it burn.

**Personality:** Cold, professional, efficient. He takes no pleasure in cruelty but accepts it as necessary. He genuinely believes the current divine order is corrupt and that its destruction is inevitable. He fights not for the Shackled God but against the gods who let his family die.

**Motivation:** Completion of his mission for the Covenant; personal revenge against a divine order that abandoned him. He believes destroying or claiming the Sunstone will prove that "holy" power is just power, no different from any other.

**Methods:** Military efficiency; he commands his forces well and adapts to changing circumstances. He summoned the Glabrezu as a last resort and privately fears the demon.

**Weakness:** His nihilism makes him predictable—he cannot conceive of genuine sacrifice or faith, which is why he could never pass the trials himself. In combat, he fights defensively when outmatched, seeking to withdraw and report rather than die meaninglessly.

**Combat Notes:**
- Use **Veteran** stat block with: +2 STR (total 18), Divine Smite (3/day, +2d8 necrotic damage on hit), 85 HP.
- Tactics: Engages strongest melee threat, uses smites aggressively, commands the Glabrezu telepathically. If reduced to 20 HP, attempts to flee.
- Immune to fear (has nothing left to lose).

#### Secondary Antagonist: The Glabrezu
**Role:** Summoned demon / Siege weapon

**Description:** Twelve feet of muscled demonic flesh, with a canine head, four arms (two ending in massive pincers), and eyes of burning malice. It strains against Kael's binding, hungry for the carnage it has been promised.

**Connection to Primary:** Bound to Kael through a summoning contract. Kael promised it "all the souls within the shrine" in exchange for battering down the gates and fighting beside him. The binding is imperfect—if Kael dies, the demon is freed to do as it pleases (likely destroying everything it can before being banished).

**Combat Notes:**
- Use **Glabrezu** stat block with half HP (78 instead of 157) to represent the weakened binding.
- Tactics: Grapples whoever holds the Sunstone; uses Confusion on clustered enemies; attempts to destroy the Sunstone if dropped.
- Can be banished with *banishment* or similar magic; also vulnerable to the Sunstone's radiant burst.

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Siege Camp
**Location:** Clearing before the Golden Gates

**Trigger:** Party is detected approaching or attacking

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Cult Fanatics | 4 | CR 2 each; zealots directing the ritual |
| Cultists | 8 | CR 1/8 each; soldiers and laborers |
| Glabrezu (partial) | 1 | Cannot leave summoning circle; uses Confusion on anyone within 30 ft. |

**Tactics:** Fanatics direct cultists to swarm intruders while they maintain the summoning. If the circle is disrupted (requires three successful DC 15 Arcana checks to sabotage or direct attack dealing 50 damage to the anchor points), the Glabrezu breaks free prematurely and attacks everyone indiscriminately.

**Difficulty:** Hard (if alerted), Medium (if surprised)

**Terrain Features:** Supply wagons provide cover; summoning circle is difficult terrain and deals 1d6 fire damage to non-demons ending turn inside; command tent has maps and intelligence.

**Rewards:** Orders from the Prophet (plot information), 250 gp in Covenant supplies, three grateful prisoners.

#### Encounter 2: Trial Complications (Optional)
**Location:** Any trial chamber

**Trigger:** Party takes excessive time (30+ minutes real time) on trials, or creates significant noise

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Shadow (Trial of Courage) | 4-6 | If party fails first attempt; shadows become real |
| Animated Armor (Trial of Wisdom) | 2 | Shrine defenses if wrong answers given |

**Tactics:** Trial defenses attack until destroyed or until the party leaves the chamber. They do not pursue.

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Rewards:** None—these are consequences, not treasure.

#### Boss Encounter: The Desecration
**Location:** The Solar Hall / Inner Sanctum

**Setup:** Immediately after claiming the Sunstone, Commander Kael and the Glabrezu breach the chamber. Isandria moves to support the party.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| [[Commander Kael]] | 1 | CR 5 Blackguard (modified Veteran) |
| Glabrezu (Weakened) | 1 | CR 9 with half HP |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 (Full Strength):** Kael and the Glabrezu fight tactically. Kael engages warriors; Glabrezu targets the Sunstone holder. Isandria uses Roar to frighten the Glabrezu, then provides support with Hold Person on Kael.
2. **Phase 2 (Kael Bloodied):** Kael becomes reckless, using all remaining smites. He curses the gods and the party alike.
3. **Phase 3 (Glabrezu Alone or Kael Dead):** If Kael dies first, the Glabrezu breaks free of control and focuses entirely on destruction—it will try to collapse the chamber if it cannot destroy the Sunstone. If the Glabrezu dies first, Kael fights to the death unless the party offers him information about his family's killers (a Covenant operation; the irony might break him).

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:**
- **Lair Action (Initiative 20):** The miniature sun flares. All creatures in the chamber must make a DC 13 Constitution save or be blinded until initiative 20 of the next round. (Occurs rounds 1, 4, 7.)
- **Isandria's Support:** On initiative 10, Isandria can use one of: Roar (frighten enemies), Hold Person (Kael), or grant one ally advantage on their next attack.

**Victory Conditions:**
- Both Kael and the Glabrezu are destroyed or banished.
- The Sunstone remains intact.

**Rewards:**
- **Kael's Equipment:** +1 Plate Armor (cursed with minor Covenant corruption—detect magic reveals faint evil aura), Bastard Sword of Necrotic Flame (as longsword, +1d6 necrotic on hit 3/day).
- **Covenant Intelligence:** Orders signed by [[The Prophet of Chains]] (sealed with shadow magic; opening requires DC 18 Arcana or dispel magic).
- **XP:** 3,900 XP (adjusted for weakened Glabrezu and ally support).

### Social Encounters

#### The Guardian's Welcome
**Location:** Entrance Hall

**NPCs Present:** [[Isandria]]

**Stakes:** Isandria must be convinced the party deserves a chance at the trials. She automatically grants this chance to anyone who enters with the Dawn Key, but their attitude affects her hints.

**Information Available:**
- Nature of the three trials (general, not specific solutions)
- History of the shrine and the Architects
- Warning about the Covenant's assault and time pressure
- Hints about the Sunstone's true nature (if party asks good questions)

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 14 | Isandria offers clearer hints for trials | Standard difficulty |
| Insight | 16 | Perceive Isandria's sorrow and desire to be released | Miss emotional context |
| Religion | 15 | Understand Architect theology; +1 on trial checks | No bonus |
| History | 18 | Know Sphinx testing traditions; reroll one failed trial | No reroll |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Party connects with Isandria emotionally and learns additional lore; she fights more effectively in the final battle.
- Moderate: Standard trial experience.
- Worst: (Cannot truly fail unless party attacks Isandria, which triggers 3,000-year-old guardian combat protocols—TPK likely.)

### Exploration Challenges

#### The Mist Navigation
**Location:** Valdris Vale interior

**Description:** Supernatural mist that loops travelers endlessly. Without the Dawn Key, escape is impossible; with it, the path is clear but not easy.

**Skills Useful:** Survival (following the Key's guidance), Perception (spotting landmarks and scouts), Stealth (avoiding Covenant patrols)

**Hazards:**
- Getting separated in the mist (if party splits up, lost members reappear at entrance after 1d4 hours)
- Covenant scout ambush (4 **Scouts** attack with surprise if party fails DC 14 group Perception)
- Memory pool visions (DC 12 Wisdom save or be transfixed by visions of the past for 1 minute—harmless but delays travel)

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| The Covenant siege | Master Elodin / scouts | Briefing / observation | Urgency of mission |
| Trial of Courage secret | Isandria's riddle | Listening carefully | "Walk forward" solution |
| Trial of Wisdom answers | Chamber architecture | DC 20 Arcana | Riddle solutions encoded |
| Trial of Sacrifice truth | Isandria's pre-trial speech | Paying attention | Understanding "true worth" |
| Isandria's condition | Observation between trials | Perception DC 13 | Her weakening state |
| Sunstone's origin | Pool of Reflection | Gazing into pool | Solar's sacrifice |
| Kael's vulnerability | Combat or Covenant orders | Reading documents | His family tragedy |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. A Covenant cultist claims there's "another way" to claim the Sunstone—through the "Shadow Path" that bypasses the trials. This path exists but is a trap; it leads directly into the Glabrezu's reach.
2. Ancient texts in the shrine suggest the trials can be "defeated through sufficient force." Attempting to break through trial chambers triggers increasingly lethal defenses.

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** Isandria is dying and the party's success is her release. She is not testing them merely for tradition—she is *desperate* for worthy successors.

**When It's Revealed:** After the Trial of Wisdom, before the Trial of Sacrifice, Isandria speaks privately to the most virtuous party member.

**Impact:** Reframes the trials from obstacles to sacred duty. The Trial of Sacrifice becomes more meaningful when the party understands they are inheriting a burden, not just claiming a prize.

**Second Revelation:** The Sunstone is sentient—it contains the essence of the Solar who became it. Solarius can communicate briefly during the claiming moment.

**Impact:** The artifact becomes more than an item; it's a fallen ally with its own perspective on the cosmic conflict.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Puzzles

#### The Riddle Floor (Trial of Wisdom)
**Location:** Trial of Wisdom Chamber

**Description:** A 64-square floor of gold and silver tiles, each marked with a letter. Answer riddles by standing on the appropriate letter squares to spell the answer. Wrong answers trigger traps.

**Solution:**
- Riddle 1: TOMORROW
- Riddle 2: FOOTSTEPS
- Riddle 3: LIGHT (or SUNLIGHT)

**Hints:**
- Isandria's pre-trial riddle: *"Words have power here. Stand upon your answer, and the path opens. Stand upon error, and face judgment."*
- The chamber ceiling shows constellations that, if mapped, trace the letters of the answers (DC 18 Investigation to notice).
- A faded inscription: "The wise speak truth with their feet."

**Bypass Options:** DC 25 Thieves' Tools to disable the trap mechanisms (allows guessing without consequences); *Dispel Magic* (DC 15) suppresses one trap trigger.

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Siege Camp approach | Stealth / Distraction / Assault / Negotiation | Affects difficulty, alarm status, prisoner fate |
| Trial of Sacrifice | What to sacrifice | Determines blessings received; shapes character development |
| Isandria's request (guardian offer) | Accept / Refuse | Refuse: blessing. Accept: She refuses but grants greater blessing |
| Kael's fate | Kill / Capture / Let flee | Kill: Glabrezu freed. Capture: Intelligence. Flee: Future enemy |
| Sunstone claiming | Who claims it | That character bears primary responsibility and connection |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Bypass the camp entirely using the Dawn Key; avoid combat until the final confrontation.
- **Diplomacy:** Attempt to negotiate with Kael (extremely difficult—requires DC 25 Persuasion and offering something he wants; even then, only delays combat).
- **Brute Force:** Assault the camp directly; harder but possible. The shrine defenses help by eliminating some Covenant forces.
- **Deception:** Disguise as Covenant reinforcements (requires captured uniforms and DC 16 Deception); gets party inside camp but complicated when they reach the shrine.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- **Failed Trials:** Isandria permits the party to leave and return in one year (or after demonstrating growth through another adventure). The Sunstone remains unclaimed but protected—for now.
- **TPK in Final Battle:** Isandria sacrifices the last of her power to resurrect one party member, who can flee with the Sunstone. The others must be resurrected elsewhere.
- **Sunstone Destroyed:** The shrine collapses; Isandria dies in despair. The party must find another way to reinforce the seals—perhaps seeking the remaining Architects themselves.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:**
Isandria fades peacefully, her golden essence joining the shrine's light. The miniature sun dims but does not go out—the shrine will endure as a sacred site. The party emerges bearing the Sunstone, which pulses warmly in response to their worthiness. News of their success spreads among those who know of the Covenant; the party becomes known quantities to both sides. The Sunstone can now be used to reinforce the seals at [[The Citadel of Tears]] or other prison-points.

**If Failed:**
The shrine is desecrated; demonic corruption spreads from the location. Isandria's death-scream echoes across the Vale, felt by sensitives for hundreds of miles. The Covenant celebrates a major victory. The seals' weakening accelerates. However, the party survives (assuming they flee before total defeat) and can pursue alternative methods of fighting the Covenant.

**If Partial Success:**
The Sunstone is secured but at cost—dead allies, escaped enemies, or Isandria's violent end. The party has the tool they need but carries the weight of what was lost. Kael (if escaped) becomes a recurring nemesis hunting them.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- The party's possession of the Sunstone makes them priority targets for [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]].
- [[The Order of the Silver Flame]] may approach the party as potential allies—or investigate them as possible Covenant agents (paranoia cuts both ways).
- The [[The Arcane Synod|Arcane Synod]] increases support, providing resources for the seal-reinforcement mission.
- The Shrine of the Morning remains sacred but guardian-less; pilgrims may eventually return.

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. **Kael's Origins:** If the party learns of his tragedy, they may investigate which Covenant operation killed his family—and discover it was ordered by [[The Prophet of Chains]] specifically to corrupt a Silver Flame paladin.
2. **The Other Architect Sites:** The Pool of Reflection shows images of other locations. The party now possesses the Dawn Key and the Sunstone—what other Architect legacies await?
3. **The Glabrezu's Master:** The demon was summoned, but who taught Kael the ritual? Someone within the Covenant specializes in demon-binding.

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| [[Isandria]] | Fades peacefully; spirit joins the Light | Dies in combat or despair |
| [[Commander Kael]] | Dead, captured, or fled wounded | Victorious; promoted within Covenant |
| Glabrezu | Destroyed or banished | Rampages until banished; kills many |
| [[Master Elodin]] | Grateful; increases support | Disappointed but understanding |
| Covenant prisoners | Freed and grateful | Unknown; likely sacrificed |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- **Emphasize Isandria's age and sorrow.** She is not a challenge to overcome but a character to interact with. Her weariness should be palpable. When she speaks of three thousand years of waiting, let that weight land.
- **The trials reward lateral thinking.** Players who approach them creatively should be rewarded. The "correct" solutions are guidelines, not requirements.
- **Kael is a tragic villain.** If the party learns his story, he becomes more interesting than a simple enemy. Let that tragedy inform his fighting style—methodical, without passion, as if he's already dead.
- **The Sunstone is a character.** When claimed, give the player a moment with Solarius's voice. This artifact has personality and opinions.
- **Let the final battle be chaotic.** Isandria helping, the Glabrezu's size making movement difficult, Kael shouting commands and curses—it should feel like a desperate defense, not a clean fight.

### Pacing Suggestions
- **Session 1:** Hook, mist navigation, siege camp approach, entrance to shrine, Trial of Courage
- **Session 2:** Trial of Wisdom, Trial of Sacrifice, Isandria's revelation, Final Battle
- **Optional Session 3:** If players are slow or want more roleplay, extend the trials; add additional Covenant reinforcements; or include a sub-quest in the mist (rescuing lost travelers)

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to destroy the summoning circle | Glabrezu breaks free early; attacks everything |
| Negotiate with Kael | He entertains it to buy time; betrays them unless offered something extraordinary |
| Attack Isandria | She defeats them effortlessly (CR 11 Gynosphinx); ejects survivors from shrine |
| Refuse to sacrifice anything | Scale doesn't balance; trial fails; one retry permitted |
| Try to take the Sunstone by force | Shrine defenses activate; 10d6 radiant damage |
| Ask Isandria about the Architects | She shares freely; knowledge is not hoarded here |
| Try to save Isandria | She cannot be saved; accepting this is its own form of sacrifice |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties (4 level 5 characters or 3 level 6):**
- Reduce Glabrezu to 50 HP instead of 78
- Kael has only 2 smites instead of 3
- Isandria is not weakened; fights at full HP
- Trial traps deal half damage

**For Stronger Parties (5 level 6 characters or 4 level 7):**
- Glabrezu at full HP (157) but still CR 9
- Add 2 Cult Fanatics to final battle (arriving round 3)
- Kael has 4 smites and Legendary Resistance (1/day)
- Trials have no retries

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- Isandria mentions "the other guardians sleep still"—implying more Architect sites with their own trials.
- The Pool of Reflection shows a brief image of [[The Citadel of Tears]]—where the Sunstone must be used.
- Kael's orders reference "the Prophet's great work nearing completion"—the seal-breaking is almost done.
- The Sunstone whispers occasionally about "my siblings"—other artifacts of Solar origin exist.

## Secrets

1. **Isandria is one of the Architects' pets/companions, left behind when they departed this realm.** She was not created to guard—she chose to stay because she could not bear to abandon the mortals her masters had sworn to protect.

2. **The Sunstone is the crystallized heart of a Solar named Solarius, who volunteered for sacrifice during the sealing of the Shackled God.** It retains fragments of his consciousness and can communicate during moments of great need. Solarius *wants* to be used to reinforce the seals—it fulfills his original purpose.

3. **Commander Kael's family was killed not by random Covenant violence but by a deliberate operation ordered by [[The Prophet of Chains]].** The Prophet targeted a promising Silver Flame paladin and engineered his fall. Kael does not know this; learning it could shatter his remaining loyalty to the Covenant.

4. **The shrine's wards are not merely magical but divine—they draw on the same power as the Silver Flame.** The [[The Order of the Silver Flame|Order of the Silver Flame]] does not know this connection exists. If they learned, they would claim the shrine as a holy site.

5. **The Glabrezu contains the trapped souls of its previous victims.** During the final battle, if a character casts *Protection from Evil and Good* on the demon and uses an action to call to the souls within, they can make a DC 18 Charisma check to free them. Success weakens the demon (-20 HP) and releases a dozen grateful spirits.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. **The Dawn Key's Call:** After [[Ruins of the Dawn]], the Dawn Key begins pulling toward the shrine. Following it is the most natural next step.
2. **Arcane Synod Research:** [[Master Elodin]] or another Synod scholar identifies the Sunstone as necessary for seal reinforcement and points the party toward the shrine.
3. **Silver Flame Intel:** The [[The Order of the Silver Flame|Order of the Silver Flame]] learns of Covenant activity in the Valdris Vale and hires the party to investigate—they don't know about the shrine but the party discovers it.
4. **Isandria's Dream:** A party member with high Wisdom or a divine connection receives a dream from Isandria—a desperate call for help from a guardian at the end of her strength.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **The Citadel Assault:** With the Sunstone in hand, the party can now attempt to reinforce the First Seal at [[The Citadel of Tears]]—or participate in the Silver Flame's planned crusade against the Covenant stronghold.
2. **Kael's Revenge:** If Kael escaped, he hunts the party obsessively, eventually learning uncomfortable truths about his own fall that may lead to redemption or further damnation.
3. **The Other Architect Sites:** The shrine contained references to sibling locations. The party has the Dawn Key—what else can it open?
4. **Solarius's Request:** The Solar spirit within the Sunstone speaks to its bearer in dreams, asking them to find "the others"—the remaining Solar artifacts scattered across the world.
5. **Covenant Escalation:** The party's success makes them priority targets. [[The Prophet of Chains]] takes personal interest in their destruction.

### Climactic Encounter
**Template:**
> Final battle in a domed chamber lit by a miniature sun. A blackguard in dark armor charges forward, necrotic flames trailing from his sword. Behind him, a twelve-foot demon with pincers for hands squeezes through a shattered doorway. Heroes stand before a crystal pedestal, golden light radiating from the artifact in their hands.

## Notes
- This adventure bridges the exploration phase ([[Ruins of the Dawn]]) and the major confrontation ([[The Citadel of Tears]] assault).
- The trials reward player creativity over combat prowess—this is intentional, providing variety in a campaign with significant combat elsewhere.
- Isandria's fate is meant to be emotionally resonant. She cannot be saved, but she can be honored. Let players grieve if they connect with her.
- The Sunstone is a campaign-critical artifact. Its powers should be significant but not overwhelming—*Sunbeam* 1/day is the baseline, with additional capabilities unlocked as the campaign progresses.
- Commander Kael can become a recurring villain or a tragic redemption arc depending on how the party handles him. Keep him alive if possible for future story potential.
