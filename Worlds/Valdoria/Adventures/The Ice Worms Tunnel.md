# The Ice Worm's Tunnel

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A claustrophobic dungeon crawl through ancient Remorhaz hibernation tunnels. Emphasize the oppressive heat, the constant threat of waking the Mother Worm, and the alien wrongness of traversing passages carved by monstrous predators. This is a tense stealth-and-survival interlude between two larger adventures.

## Overview
The magical storm surrounding the Obsidian Gate is impassable by normal means, but the ancient maps recovered from the Architects' archive reveal an alternative: a network of tunnels carved by generations of Remorhaz, the titanic ice worms that hibernate deep within the Sundered Peaks. These geothermally-heated passages run directly beneath the fortress's outer defenses, emerging inside the perimeter wall. The party must navigate chambers filled with dormant eggs, evade aggressive hatchlings, and above all else avoid waking the Mother Worm--a creature ancient even by Remorhaz standards, whose tunnels form the spine of this subterranean labyrinth.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Dungeon Crawl

**Tone:** Horror / Survival

**Themes:**
- Claustrophobia and the weight of stone
- The terror of apex predators in their domain
- Violation of alien spaces not meant for humanoids

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 1 Session (4-5 hours)

**Party Level:** 9

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Hard

**Combat Frequency:** Moderate (2-3 encounters, but high stakes)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Low

**Exploration Emphasis:** High

## The Hook

### How It Begins
After dealing with Cryonax atop the Dragon's Spine, the party reaches the far side of the Sundered Peaks--only to find their path blocked by the Storm of Chains, an unnatural blizzard of freezing wind and black lightning that surrounds the Obsidian Gate in a half-mile radius. No mortal can survive passage through it. Consulting the Architects' maps reveals the only alternative: ancient markings indicate a Remorhaz tunnel network that passes beneath the storm, emerging somewhere inside the fortress perimeter.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** The Architects' Map (recovered from [[Ruins of the Dawn]])
**Motivation:** The map is simply information, showing the tunnel entrance marked with a warning glyph: "The Warm Path. Do not wake the Matriarch."
**What They Offer:** A route past an impassable obstacle.

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The tunnel entrance is a natural cave that radiates unnatural warmth despite the surrounding ice.
- The tunnels were carved by Remorhaz over centuries, following geothermal vents.
- The map shows a roughly linear path, approximately 2 miles, emerging near the fortress's outer wall foundation.
- Warning glyphs indicate a "Matriarch" of immense size guards the deepest chambers.

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate

**Consequences of Delay:** Each long rest the party takes allows the Covenant more time to complete their ritual at the Obsidian Gate. Additionally, lingering in the tunnels increases the chance of encountering a Remorhaz hunting party returning from the surface.

## Background

### The Situation
The Remorhaz tunnels have existed for millennia, carved by successive generations of these titanic predators as they burrow through rock and ice seeking geothermal heat. The current tunnel network centers on the Matriarch's Chamber, where a Remorhaz of unprecedented age and size lairs amid her latest clutch of eggs. Young Remorhaz patrol the outer tunnels, instinctively defending the nesting grounds. The Architects knew of these tunnels and marked them on their maps, but wisely never used this route--the notation suggests they considered the risk too great. What the maps don't show is that the tunnel system has grown significantly since they were drawn; the Matriarch has been digging for centuries.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- The Remorhaz colonized these tunnels roughly 3,000 years ago, drawn by rich geothermal activity.
- The current Matriarch is at least 800 years old, an unprecedented lifespan that may be connected to the Imprisoned's influence bleeding through the nearby prison.
- The Architects marked this route as an emergency option but noted it was "not recommended under any circumstances."
- Recent Covenant activity at the Obsidian Gate has disturbed the tunnels' equilibrium, making the Remorhaz more aggressive.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| The Matriarch | Protect her eggs and territory | Remains dormant unless disturbed; awakens to hunt intruders |
| Young Remorhaz | Feed and patrol | Hunt in packs of 2-3, alert the Matriarch to large threats |
| Remorhaz Eggs | Incubate | Radiate heat, will hatch if significantly disturbed |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** They emerge inside the Obsidian Gate's perimeter, bypassing the Storm of Chains and the fortress's outer defenses entirely--a massive tactical advantage.

**If the party fails:** They are either killed by Remorhaz or forced to retreat, losing precious time. Worse, they may alert the Covenant to the tunnel route, causing them to collapse or guard it.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Traverse the Remorhaz tunnel network from the entrance cave to the exit point inside the Obsidian Gate perimeter without causing a catastrophic awakening of the Matriarch.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Map the tunnel system for potential future use or escape route.
2. Recover Remorhaz components (molten blood, superheated scales) for crafting.
3. Discover what enhanced the Matriarch's longevity (shadow corruption investigation).

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. The tunnels contain evidence of Architect explorers who died here--their remains hold useful equipment.
2. A secondary passage leads to a geothermal vent that could be collapsed to destroy part of the Obsidian Gate's foundation (setup for a later opportunity).

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The party reaches the exit tunnel and emerges inside the fortress perimeter.
- The Matriarch remains asleep (optimal) or is avoided without a full confrontation (acceptable).

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- Total party kill by Remorhaz.
- The Matriarch awakens fully and collapses the tunnel system in her rage, blocking the route.
- The party retreats and loses 1d4 days finding an alternative approach.

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Egg Chamber
**Goal:** Navigate the outer tunnels and pass through the egg nursery.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Warm Mouth:** The party enters the tunnel system through a cave that grows progressively warmer. The walls transition from ice to steaming rock, and the passage narrows to single-file in places. Perception checks reveal the circular bore marks of Remorhaz passage.
2. **The First Warning:** The party discovers the frozen (then thawed, then re-frozen) remains of an Architect explorer, their skeleton clutching a journal. The journal describes the route and contains a final entry: "The eggs are everywhere. We tried to move quietly. We failed."
3. **The Nursery:** A vast cavern filled with over forty Remorhaz eggs, each the size of a large barrel, glowing with internal heat. The party must cross 200 feet of egg-strewn terrain without breaking any eggs or making loud noises.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The tunnel system is larger than the maps indicate.
- The eggs respond to vibration and sound--cracking them releases pheromones that attract adults.
- Somewhere deeper, something very large is breathing.

**Transition to Act 2:** The party successfully crosses the nursery and descends deeper into warmer tunnels, where the walls begin to glow with geothermal heat.

### Act 2: The Hatchling Gauntlet
**Goal:** Survive encounters with Young Remorhaz in the hunting tunnels.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Molten River:** A tunnel bisected by a flow of liquid rock, requiring creative crossing. The heat alone deals damage to those who linger.
2. **The Ambush:** Two Young Remorhaz detect the party and attack from ambush positions, erupting from tunnel walls.
3. **The Breathing Walls:** A section of tunnel where the walls pulse rhythmically--the party realizes they are walking through a passage carved directly alongside the Matriarch's chamber. They can hear her massive heartbeat through the stone.

**Rising Tension:** Each encounter increases the party's paranoia. The tunnels grow narrower, hotter, and more alien in their geometry.

**Midpoint Twist:** The party discovers that the "exit" marked on their map has partially collapsed. They must either dig through (time-consuming and noisy) or take an unmarked side passage that runs even closer to the Matriarch's lair.

**Transition to Act 3:** The party commits to the dangerous route, entering tunnels where the Matriarch's presence is palpable.

### Act 3: The Mother's Domain
**Goal:** Pass the Matriarch's lair and escape to the surface.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Glow:** The tunnel opens into a massive chamber where the Matriarch sleeps coiled around a geothermal vent. She is enormous--at least 80 feet long, her body radiating heat that raises the chamber temperature to dangerous levels. The party must cross this chamber using cover provided by rock formations and her own coiled bulk.
2. **The Awakening:** Whether through failed stealth or deliberate disturbance, the Matriarch stirs. The party must flee through the final tunnel as she begins to wake, her movements causing cave-ins behind them.
3. **The Exit:** The party bursts from a fissure in the mountainside--and finds themselves inside the Obsidian Gate's outer wall, looking at the fortress from within its perimeter.

**Climactic Encounter:** The encounter with the Matriarch is designed as a chase/escape rather than a fight. If the party attempts to battle her, they will almost certainly die.

**Resolution Options:**
- Complete stealth: The Matriarch never wakes, and the party emerges undetected.
- Partial awakening: The Matriarch wakes but doesn't pursue; the party escapes with exhaustion levels from the heat and sprint.
- Full awakening: The Matriarch pursues; the party must use environment to delay her and barely escape.

## Locations

### Overview Map
The tunnel system runs roughly southwest to northeast, descending from the surface entrance through the Egg Chamber, then through the Hunting Tunnels, past the Matriarch's Lair, and finally emerging inside the Obsidian Gate perimeter. Total distance is approximately 2 miles as the crow flies, but the winding tunnels make the actual journey nearly 4 miles.

### Primary Location: The Egg Chamber
**Name:** The Nursery

**Description:** A natural cavern roughly 300 feet in diameter, its floor covered with Remorhaz eggs in various stages of development. The eggs glow with internal heat, casting the chamber in shifting orange light. The air is thick and humid, smelling of sulfur and something organic. Thin paths wind between the egg clusters.

**Key Features:**
- Over 40 Remorhaz eggs, each 4 feet tall and radiating 10 feet of uncomfortable heat.
- Unstable footing--the floor is covered in shed chitin, bones, and crystallized mineral deposits.
- Three exit tunnels at different heights in the chamber walls.
- A central formation of volcanic rock provides limited cover and a elevated vantage point.

**Encounters Here:** Egg Chamber Crossing (Exploration Challenge)

### Location 2: The Hunting Tunnels
**Description:** A network of winding passages carved by generations of Remorhaz, ranging from 20 feet in diameter to barely 5 feet. The walls show the characteristic circular bore marks of Remorhaz passage and radiate intense heat from geothermal activity. Occasional vents release jets of steam.

**Key Features:**
- Variable tunnel width forces the party to change formation frequently.
- Ambient temperature of 100-120 degrees Fahrenheit causes exhaustion over time.
- Remorhaz hunting trails intersect at several points.
- The Molten River bisects one major passage.

**Encounters Here:** Young Remorhaz Ambush, Molten River Crossing

### Location 3: The Matriarch's Lair
**Description:** A cathedral-sized chamber carved around a major geothermal vent, its ceiling lost in darkness and steam. The Matriarch lies coiled around the vent like a dragon on her hoard, her body a mountain of superheated chitin and glowing orange segments. The chamber floor is littered with the bones of massive prey.

**Key Features:**
- Chamber is roughly 400 feet in diameter with a 200-foot ceiling.
- The geothermal vent at center provides the only light, casting everything in hellish orange.
- The Matriarch occupies the chamber center; the exit tunnel is on the far side.
- Rock formations provide cover for a careful party.
- Temperature exceeds 130 degrees Fahrenheit near the Matriarch.

**Encounters Here:** The Matriarch (Chase/Escape)

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Surface Entrance | Egg Chamber | 0.5 miles | Narrowing passages, increasing heat |
| Egg Chamber | Hunting Tunnels | 1 mile | Steam vents, unstable footing |
| Hunting Tunnels | Matriarch's Lair | 1.5 miles | Young Remorhaz, molten river, extreme heat |
| Matriarch's Lair | Exit | 0.5 miles | The Matriarch, cave-ins |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

There are no allies in the Remorhaz tunnels. This is a place of predators and prey, and the party is definitively the latter.

### Neutrals

#### The Dead Architect
**Role:** Information source (corpse)

**Description:** The skeletal remains of an Architect explorer who died here centuries ago, their bones fused to the tunnel wall by mineral deposits and heat. Their enchanted journal survived.

**Personality:** N/A (deceased)

**What They Want:** N/A

**Attitude Toward Party:** The journal provides crucial information about tunnel navigation and Remorhaz behavior, written by someone who died learning these lessons.

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: The Matriarch
**Role:** Apex predator and obstacle

**Description:** The Matriarch is a Remorhaz of unprecedented size and age, measuring over 80 feet in length with a body diameter of nearly 15 feet. Her chitin has darkened to a deep crimson-black from centuries of geothermal exposure, and her superheated core burns brighter than any of her children. Her eyes, when open, gleam with a malevolent intelligence that suggests she is far more aware than typical Remorhaz--possibly touched by the Imprisoned's influence bleeding through the nearby prison. She has carved these tunnels over eight centuries and knows every passage intimately.

**Personality:** Territorial, patient, ancient, and utterly merciless. She doesn't hunt for sport--she eliminates threats.

**Motivation:** Protect her territory and offspring. Anything that disturbs her lair must be destroyed.

**Methods:** Ambush predator tactics even at her size; uses tunnel knowledge to cut off escape routes; her heat aura is so intense it damages creatures before she even attacks.

**Weakness:** She is slow to fully wake from deep sleep. Loud noises disturb her, but she won't immediately pursue unless she perceives a genuine threat to her eggs.

**Combat Notes:** The Matriarch uses Ancient Remorhaz statistics (CR 15+) with additional legendary actions representing her age and size. Direct combat is not recommended for a level 9 party--this is an escape encounter.

#### Secondary Antagonist: Young Remorhaz
**Role:** Tunnel predators and alert system

**Description:** Adolescent Remorhaz ranging from 15-25 feet in length, their superheated bodies leaving trails of scorched rock. They hunt in pairs or trios, communicating through vibrations in the stone.

**Connection to Primary:** The Young Remorhaz are the Matriarch's offspring. If seriously threatened or killed, the dying Remorhaz releases pheromones that may wake the Matriarch.

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: Young Remorhaz Ambush
**Location:** The Hunting Tunnels, at a junction where two passages meet.

**Trigger:** The party makes significant noise, or the Remorhaz on patrol detect body heat.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Young Remorhaz | 2 | CR 5 each; MM p.258 |

**Tactics:** The Young Remorhaz burst from side tunnels simultaneously, attempting to flank the party. They target the warmest creatures first (typically spellcasters using magic or characters in metal armor). If reduced below half HP, one flees deeper into the tunnels while shrieking--a sound that may wake the Matriarch (DC 15 Stealth check to silence it before it escapes).

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Terrain Features:**
- 10-foot wide tunnel limits movement options.
- Walls are hot to the touch (1d6 fire damage on contact).
- A steam vent can be triggered (Dexterity save DC 14 or 3d6 fire damage) if a creature is pushed into it.

**Rewards:**
- Remorhaz blood (rare alchemical component, 200 gp value per vial, 2 vials per creature).
- Superheated chitin scales (crafting material for fire-resistant armor, 150 gp value per creature).

#### Encounter 2: Molten River Crossing
**Location:** A tunnel bisected by a 20-foot wide flow of liquid rock.

**Trigger:** Automatic; the party must cross to continue.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Fire Elemental | 1 | CR 5; emerges if the river is disturbed |

**Tactics:** The Fire Elemental manifests only if the party disturbs the molten river significantly (failed Athletics checks, falling in, using water-based magic). It fights to drive intruders away from "its" territory rather than to kill.

**Difficulty:** Medium (environmental hazard + possible combat)

**Terrain Features:**
- The molten river deals 6d10 fire damage to any creature that enters it or starts its turn there.
- The heat within 5 feet of the river deals 1d10 fire damage per turn.
- Stone formations provide potential jumping points (Athletics DC 14 for each 10-foot jump).
- A natural stone bridge exists but is partially collapsed (can support 200 lbs at a time).

**Rewards:**
- Volcanic glass formations worth 50 gp can be harvested.
- If the Fire Elemental is defeated, its core can be harvested (rare component, 300 gp).

#### Boss Encounter: The Matriarch (Chase/Escape)
**Location:** The Matriarch's Lair and the Exit Tunnel.

**Setup:** The party must cross the Matriarch's chamber. If they fail stealth checks or make excessive noise, she begins to wake. This is not a fight--it's an escape sequence.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| The Matriarch | 1 | Ancient Remorhaz, CR 15+; see custom statblock |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 - Stirring:** The Matriarch shifts in her sleep. Party has 2 rounds to reach cover or exit before she opens her eyes. Stealth DC 18.
2. **Phase 2 - Awakening:** The Matriarch raises her head, scanning the chamber. Party must remain motionless (DC 20 Stealth) or flee. She attacks anything she clearly sees.
3. **Phase 3 - Pursuit:** If fully awakened, the Matriarch pursues into the exit tunnel. Her movement causes cave-ins (Dexterity save DC 16, 4d10 bludgeoning on failure). Party must outrun her for 500 feet to reach the exit.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:**
- **Lair Action (Initiative 20):** The tunnel temperature spikes; all creatures take 2d6 fire damage.
- **Legendary Action (1):** Heated Body Pulse - All creatures within 30 feet take 2d6 fire damage.
- **Legendary Action (2):** Tunnel Collapse - The Matriarch deliberately collapses a 20-foot section of tunnel behind her; creatures in the area take 4d10 bludgeoning damage (Dex save DC 16 for half).
- **Legendary Action (3):** Swallow - The Matriarch attempts to swallow a creature (as per Remorhaz Swallow, but DC 18 and 6d6 acid damage).

**Victory Conditions:**
- The party escapes through the exit tunnel before being killed or swallowed.
- Optimal: The party never wakes the Matriarch and exits without incident.

**Rewards:**
- Survival is its own reward.
- If the party somehow obtained Matriarch components (unlikely), they would be worth 5,000+ gp.

### Social Encounters

There are no social encounters in this adventure. The Remorhaz cannot be reasoned with, bargained with, or intimidated.

### Exploration Challenges

#### Egg Chamber Crossing
**Location:** The Nursery

**Description:** The party must cross 200 feet of chamber floor covered with Remorhaz eggs without breaking any eggs or making loud noises. The eggs respond to vibration--disturbing one can cause a chain reaction of cracking that releases pheromones alerting adults.

**Skills Useful:**
- Stealth (primary): Moving quietly between eggs.
- Acrobatics: Navigating unstable footing.
- Perception: Spotting safe paths and avoiding fragile eggs.
- Nature: Understanding Remorhaz behavior and egg vulnerability.

**Hazards:**
- Breaking an egg releases pheromones (Young Remorhaz arrive in 2d4 rounds) and 2d6 fire damage from the superheated embryonic fluid.
- The ambient heat causes 1 level of exhaustion per hour without protection.
- Some "eggs" are actually recently hatched and contain newborn Remorhaz (CR 1) that will attack if their shell is touched.

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Intact Remorhaz eggs are valuable to certain buyers (2,000 gp each, but weighing 200 lbs).
- A dead adventurer's pack contains a *Potion of Fire Resistance* and a *Scroll of Protection from Energy*.

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Architect journal | Tunnel entrance | Perception (body) | Tunnel navigation tips, warning about eggs |
| Bore marks show size variation | Hunting Tunnels | Nature check | Realization that something much larger made the main passages |
| Pulsing walls = Matriarch | The Breathing Walls | Perception DC 15 | Exact location of the Matriarch's chamber |
| Secondary passage marked | Collapsed tunnel | Investigation DC 14 | Alternative route past cave-in |
| Shadow corruption signs | Matriarch's Lair | Arcana DC 16 | Evidence the Imprisoned's influence affects the tunnels |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. A side tunnel appears to lead upward toward the surface--it actually leads to a dead end where previous explorers died.
2. Cooler air currents suggest a safe passage, but actually lead toward a steam vent that erupts periodically.

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The Matriarch's unusual size and longevity are connected to the Imprisoned's influence. She has been feeding on shadow energy bleeding through the weakening seals for centuries, making her more than a mere beast.

**When It's Revealed:** When the party enters the Matriarch's lair, a DC 16 Arcana check reveals traces of shadow corruption in the geothermal vent she sleeps around.

**Impact:** This suggests the Imprisoned's influence is leaking through the seals more than anyone realized, potentially complicating the party's mission at the Obsidian Gate.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Steam Vent | Multiple | Weight plate or timer | 15-foot cone of superheated steam | Dex 14 | 4d6 fire |
| Unstable Ceiling | Exit Tunnel | Loud noise | 20-foot area collapse | Dex 15 | 4d10 bludgeoning |
| Newborn Remorhaz "Egg" | Nursery | Touch | Creature bursts out attacking | Initiative | N/A (combat) |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Extreme Heat | All tunnels | 1 exhaustion level/hour | Fire resistance, *Endure Elements*, Constitution saves |
| Superheated Surfaces | Walls throughout | 1d6 fire damage on contact | Don't touch the walls |
| Low Oxygen | Deep tunnels | Disadvantage on physical checks | *Water Breathing* (repurposed), Constitution saves |
| Geothermal Gas | Matriarch's Lair | DC 13 Con save or poisoned 1 hour | Hold breath, wind magic |

### Puzzles

#### The Collapsed Passage
**Location:** Junction before the Matriarch's Lair

**Description:** The tunnel marked on the map has partially collapsed. A 30-foot section is filled with rubble. The party must either dig through (2 hours of work, very noisy) or find the alternative passage.

**Solution:** A DC 14 Investigation check reveals a natural fissure concealed by mineral deposits. This side passage is tighter and runs closer to the Matriarch's chamber, but it's passable.

**Hints:**
- The Architect journal mentions "the fissure behind the blue crystal" as an emergency route.
- A DC 12 Perception check notices air movement from the concealed crack.

**Bypass Options:**
- *Passwall* or *Stone Shape* can create a new passage.
- A Tiny creature could scout the fissure and confirm it leads somewhere.
- Spending 2 hours digging works but alerts all Remorhaz in the area.

## Rewards

### Treasure

#### Monetary
**Total Value:** 600-1,000 gp (plus optional egg value)

**Distribution:**
| Location | Contents | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Dead Architect | Coin purse, silver jewelry | 150 gp |
| Young Remorhaz (2) | Blood, scales | 700 gp (components) |
| Volcanic formations | Obsidian, crystals | 100 gp |

#### Magic Items
| Item | Location | Guarded By |
|------|----------|------------|
| Potion of Fire Resistance | Dead adventurer in Nursery | Eggs (must navigate carefully) |
| Scroll of Protection from Energy | Dead adventurer in Nursery | Eggs |
| Architect's Journal | Tunnel entrance | Nothing (corpse) |

### Quest Rewards
**From Quest Giver:** N/A (self-directed survival mission)

**Additional Rewards:** Emerging inside the Obsidian Gate perimeter provides significant tactical advantage for the next adventure.

### Experience
**Combat XP:**
- 2 Young Remorhaz: 3,600 XP (1,800 each)
- 1 Fire Elemental (if fought): 1,800 XP
- Total combat potential: 5,400 XP

**Non-Combat XP:**
- Crossing the Egg Chamber without incident: 2,000 XP
- Successfully escaping the Matriarch: 3,000 XP
- Discovering the shadow corruption: 500 XP

**Milestone Advancement:** This interlude does not award a level but contributes to the cumulative experience that should bring the party to Level 10 during or after The Obsidian Gate.

### Intangible Rewards
- **Reputation:** The party has accomplished something the ancient Architects considered too dangerous to attempt.
- **Allies Gained:** None.
- **Information Learned:** The Imprisoned's influence is bleeding through the seals, affecting creatures for miles around.
- **Story Hooks:** The tunnel system exists as a potential escape route from the Obsidian Gate if things go wrong.

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Collapsed tunnel | Dig through (loud) / Find fissure (dangerous) / Magic bypass | Digging alerts Remorhaz; fissure passes closer to Matriarch; magic preserves stealth |
| Wounded Young Remorhaz fleeing | Let it go / Kill it quickly / Capture it | Letting it go may wake Matriarch; killing requires speed; capturing could provide distraction |
| Matriarch begins waking | Freeze (stealth) / Run (escape) / Attack (suicide) | Stealth may let her settle; running triggers chase; attacking results in TPK |
| Discover shadow corruption | Investigate further / Ignore | Investigation provides info but risks waking Matriarch |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** The optimal approach. High Stealth modifiers and careful movement can allow passage without any combat.
- **Diplomacy:** Impossible. Remorhaz are not intelligent enough for negotiation.
- **Brute Force:** Suicidal against the Matriarch, viable against Young Remorhaz but noisy.
- **Deception:** Limited options. *Disguise Self* or illusions might confuse Young Remorhaz briefly. Pheromone-based deception (if the party harvested Remorhaz materials) could mask their scent.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- If the party is forced to retreat, they lose 1d4 days finding an alternative route (flying over the storm with heavy protection, or a long detour around the mountain range).
- If one or more party members are killed, resurrection is possible if bodies can be retrieved, but this may require another tunnel run.
- If the Matriarch collapses the tunnels, this route is permanently closed--consequences for any escape plan.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** The party emerges from a fissure in the mountainside to find themselves inside the Obsidian Gate's outer perimeter wall. They're behind enemy lines, with the fortress looming before them and the Storm of Chains raging uselessly behind them. They've accomplished something the Architects never dared.

**If Failed:** The party is forced to retreat and seek another route. The Covenant may become aware of the tunnel entrance and collapse or guard it. The party loses valuable time.

**If Partial Success:** The party emerges but in bad condition--exhaustion levels, depleted resources, possibly missing a member who was swallowed. They're inside the perimeter but not at full strength for the challenges ahead.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- If the Matriarch was awakened but not killed, she may emerge from the tunnels seeking new territory, becoming a threat to the region.
- The tunnel system, if mapped, represents a valuable strategic resource for future operations.
- Evidence of shadow corruption supports the urgency of stopping the Covenant's ritual.

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. The Matriarch remains alive in the tunnels--someone may need to deal with her eventually.
2. The shadow corruption affecting the Matriarch may be spreading to other creatures near the prison.

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| The Matriarch | Remains asleep or briefly disturbed | May emerge to hunt the region |
| Young Remorhaz | Dead or bypassed | May pursue party to surface |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Emphasize sensory details: the oppressive heat, the smell of sulfur, the alien geometry of the Remorhaz tunnels, the constant drip of condensation.
- Use sound design if possible--deep rumbling, the distant sound of something massive breathing.
- Track exhaustion from heat exposure; this isn't just flavor, it's a mechanical threat.
- The Matriarch encounter should feel like facing a natural disaster, not a monster. Players should know immediately that fighting her is not an option.
- Allow creative solutions--players who think to use cold spells for comfort, silence spells for stealth, or similar approaches should be rewarded.

### Pacing Suggestions
- Start slow and atmospheric, building dread as the tunnels grow warmer.
- The Egg Chamber should be tense and careful--no rushing.
- The Young Remorhaz ambush provides an action beat after the slow tension.
- The Matriarch's lair should be the peak of tension--describe her breathing, her heat, her size.
- The escape (if triggered) should be frantic and desperate--no time to think.

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to kill the Matriarch | Make it very clear this is suicide; if they persist, TPK is appropriate |
| Harvest Remorhaz eggs | Possible but very risky; one mistake releases pheromones |
| Use cold magic extensively | Effective for comfort but may attract Remorhaz who sense temperature anomalies |
| Attempt to collapse tunnels behind them | Possible, but the noise will wake everything |
| Send a familiar or summoned creature to scout | Excellent idea; reward with useful information |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Reduce Young Remorhaz to 1 per encounter.
- Extend the time before the Matriarch fully wakes.
- Provide more cover in the Matriarch's chamber.
- Allow exhaustion saves to be made with advantage.

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add a third Young Remorhaz to the ambush.
- The Matriarch is a lighter sleeper (lower Stealth DCs to avoid waking her).
- Environmental hazards deal additional damage dice.
- Include a shadow-touched Young Remorhaz with necrotic damage and pack tactics.

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- The shadow corruption hints at the Imprisoned's growing influence, relevant to the climax at the Obsidian Gate.
- Emerging inside the perimeter sets up the infiltration approach for The Obsidian Gate.
- If the tunnels are mapped, they may serve as an escape route after the ritual chamber confrontation.

## Secrets

1. The Matriarch's unusual size and longevity come from centuries of feeding on shadow energy leaking through the Prison's weakening seals. She is effectively a proto-shadow creature.

2. The Architects knew about this connection and marked the tunnels "forbidden" not just because of the Remorhaz, but because they feared the shadow contamination could spread to those who lingered.

3. A second exit from the tunnel system leads directly to the Obsidian Gate's geothermal tap--the power source for the fortress. This could be exploited to sabotage the facility.

1. The party defeats or bypasses Cryonax in [[Into the Sundered Peaks]] and reaches the far side of the mountains, only to encounter the Storm of Chains.
2. The Architects' maps, recovered from [[Ruins of the Dawn]], show the Remorhaz tunnels as an emergency bypass.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. The party emerges inside the fortress perimeter, beginning [[The Obsidian Gate]] with a significant advantage.
2. Knowledge of the tunnel system provides a potential escape route if the final confrontation goes badly.
3. The discovery of shadow corruption adds urgency to stopping the Covenant's ritual before the contamination spreads further.

**Prompt:**
**A colossal Remorhaz, eighty feet of crimson-black chitin coiled around a geothermal vent. The creature's segments glow like magma between armored plates. One massive eye begins to open. In the foreground, four adventurers sprint desperately toward a distant tunnel exit as the chamber begins to shake. Rocks fall from the ceiling. The heat distortion makes the air shimmer. Pure terror and desperate escape.

## Notes
This adventure functions as a tense interlude between the dragon-hunting wilderness survival of Into the Sundered Peaks and the infiltration-focused dungeon of The Obsidian Gate. It provides:
- A change of pace from the previous adventure's open-sky survival.
- A skill-based challenge that rewards planning and caution over combat prowess.
- An introduction to the shadow corruption theme that becomes central in the climax.
- A sense of accomplishment through bypassing an "impossible" obstacle.

Design inspiration: Alien (the original film), the Mines of Moria sequence from Fellowship of the Ring, and real-world caving expedition accounts. The horror comes from claustrophobia, heat, and the knowledge that something massive is nearby--not from jump scares or gore.
