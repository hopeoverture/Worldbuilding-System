> A short interlude adventure to bridge the gap between returning from the mines and the village troubles.

## Overview
The night after the party returns from the **Old Echo Mine** with the captives (and potentially the Shard), the residual necrotic energy triggers a reaction in the local graveyard. While the village celebrates the return of the lost, the dead begin to stir. The party must defend the **Oakhaven Cemetery** gates to prevent the zombies from crashing the celebration.
