# The Mourning Wake

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A short interlude adventure bridging the return from the mines and the village troubles. This encounter introduces the party to the consequences of meddling with dark artifacts and establishes the ongoing threat of the Shard's corruption.

## Overview
The night after the party returns from the **Old Echo Mine** with the captives (and potentially the **Shard of Shadow**), the residual necrotic energy triggers a reaction in the local graveyard. While the village of [[Oakhaven]] celebrates the return of their loved ones at the **Golden Tankard**, the dead begin to stir in the cemetery on the hill. The party must defend the cemetery gates and prevent the undead from crashing the celebration and slaughtering the villagers.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Defense / Horror

**Tone:** Horror / Action

- The dead do not rest easy

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** One-Shot (2-3 Hours)

**Party Level:** 1

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate

**Combat Frequency:** High (Wave-based combat)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Low

**Exploration Emphasis:** Low

## The Hook

### How It Begins
Mid-celebration at the **Golden Tankard**, as the party enjoys their well-earned rest and the villagers toast to Timmy's return, the door bursts open. **Gravedigger Hemlock**, covered in dirt and pale as a ghost himself, stumbles in screaming: *"They're scratching at the dirt! The dead—they're RISING!"*

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Gravedigger Hemlock]]
**Motivation:** Terrified for his life; he lives in a shack next to the cemetery.
**What They Offer:** Nothing material—just desperate pleas and knowledge of the cemetery layout.

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- Hemlock heard scratching sounds coming from multiple graves.
- A cold wind swept through the cemetery despite the warm night.
- The old iron fence is the only thing between the cemetery and the village.

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Critical

**Consequences of Delay:** The undead will breach the fence and attack the celebration within minutes.

## Background

### The Situation
The **Shard of Shadow** (whether in the party's possession or left in the mine) has leaked necrotic energy into the earth. This energy seeped through the ground to the cemetery, reanimating the recently deceased and disturbing older spirits. The corruption is temporary—dawn will end it—but until then, the dead walk.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- **Hours ago:** The party returned with the Shard (or killed Groz, releasing its energy).
- **Now:** The accumulated necrotic energy reaches critical mass.
- **Dawn:** The energy will dissipate, but not before causing havoc.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Gravedigger Hemlock]] | Survive | Hide behind the heroes |
| [[Mayor Haldor]] | Protect his people | Rally villagers, arm them |
| [[The Specter]] (Boss) | Feed on fear | Attack the living |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** The village is saved, and the party's reputation grows. They learn the Shard's danger.

**If the party fails:** Villagers die; the celebration becomes a massacre. The party is blamed.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Keep the undead contained within the cemetery walls until dawn (approximately 2 hours of in-game time, represented by waves of enemies).

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Protect Gravedigger Hemlock (he knows useful information).
2. Destroy the **Specter** before it can possess anyone.
3. Keep civilian casualties at zero.

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. The oldest crypt contains a blessed weapon that can aid against the Specter.
2. The Shard pulses in time with the undead rising—containing it weakens them.

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- No undead breach the cemetery fence before dawn.
- The Specter is destroyed.

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- Multiple undead breach the fence and reach the village.
- A party member dies (raises as a zombie at next wave).

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Barricade
**Goal:** Reach the cemetery and secure the entrance before the undead break through.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Sprint:** Racing from the tavern to the cemetery hill (skill challenge: Athletics/Acrobatics).
2. **The Gates:** The wrought iron gates are rusted but holdable. Skill checks to reinforce them (Athletics DC 12, Carpenter's Tools DC 10).

**Information to Reveal:**
- The graves nearest the mine (north side) are the most active.
- Hemlock mentions the old crypt of the Thornwood family has "blessed ground."

**Transition to Act 2:** The first wave of undead reaches the gates.

### Act 2: The Rising
**Goal:** Defend against three waves of undead.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **Wave 1 - The Grasping:** Crawling Claws burst from the soft earth, scrabbling at the fence.
2. **Wave 2 - The Shambling:** Full Zombies rise, slow but relentless, pushing against the gates.
3. **Wave 3 - The Swarming:** A mix of Zombies and Skeletons attack from multiple points.

**Rising Tension:** Between waves, the party hears a voice whispering from the oldest crypt: *"Release me... I hunger..."*

**Midpoint Twist:** The Shard (if present) begins to glow; the undead seem drawn to it. If a party member holds it, they are the primary target.

**Transition to Act 3:** The crypt doors crack open.

### Act 3: The Source
**Goal:** Defeat the **Specter** that has risen as the manifestation of the Shard's corruption.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Emergence:** A **Specter** forms from the gathered necrotic energy, rising from the Thornwood crypt.
2. **The Final Battle:** The Specter commands the remaining undead while attacking the party directly.

**Climactic Encounter:** Specter + remaining undead vs. the party.

**Resolution Options:**
- Destroy the Specter, ending the threat.
- If the Shard is present, casting *Light* or *Sacred Flame* on it weakens the Specter (vulnerability to radiant).
- Sunrise ends the encounter automatically (but feels less heroic).

## Locations

### Overview Map
The cemetery sits on a hill overlooking Oakhaven. A single winding path leads up from the village. The iron fence surrounds the graveyard on all sides.

### Primary Location

**Encounters Here:** All combat encounters occur here.

### Location 2: The Thornwood Crypt

**Key Features:**
- **Blessed Ground:** Undead that enter take 1d4 radiant damage per round.

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| The Shard caused this | Cemetery | Observation (Shard glows) | Understanding the threat |
| Thornwood crypt has blessed ground | Hemlock | Asking | Safe haven / Holy Water |
| Dawn ends the threat | Hemlock | Asking | Survival strategy |
| Specter is the source | Crypt doors opening | Observation | Boss target |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. The goblin attacks "cursed" the cemetery (false—it's the Shard).
2. Someone was buried alive and their ghost is angry (false).

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** If the party has the Shard, it pulses in time with the undead rising. Destroying or containing it (DC 15 Arcana) ends the threat early.

**When It's Revealed:** During Wave 2 or when the Specter emerges.

**Impact:** The party realizes the Shard is dangerous and must be dealt with.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Uneven Ground | Cemetery | Difficult terrain | None |
| Rusted Fence | Weak points | Breaks if 10+ damage | Reinforce with skill checks |
| Grave Mist | Everywhere | Lightly obscured | Torches help |

### Puzzles

**Description:** Heavy iron chains and a rusted padlock secure the doors.

**Solution:** Break the chain (AC 10, 10 HP) or pick the lock (DC 15 Thieves' Tools).

**Hints:**
- Hemlock has a key but can't remember where he put it (in his shack).
- Brute force works.

**Bypass Options:** Wait for the Specter to burst out (not recommended).

## Rewards

**Total Value:** 50 gp

**Distribution:**
| Location | Contents | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Thornwood Crypt | Old coins, family heirlooms | 50 gp |

#### Magic Items
| Item | Location | Guarded By |
|------|----------|------------|

**Non-Combat XP:** 50 XP for protecting all villagers.

**Milestone Advancement:** Partial progress toward Level 2.

### Intangible Rewards
- **Reputation:** "Cemetery Defenders"; villagers trust the party completely.
- **Allies Gained:** Hemlock becomes a useful (if cowardly) contact.
- **Information Learned:** The Shard is dangerously reactive; it must be studied or contained.
- **Story Hooks:** The Specter whispered something about "the Temple" before dying.

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| How to handle Shard | Keep / Bury / Give to temple | Affects future corruption events |
| Save villagers or chase Specter | Split / Prioritize | Casualties or boss escapes temporarily |
| Enter crypt during combat | Yes / No | Risk vs. reward |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Not effective; the undead sense the living.
- **Diplomacy:** Undead cannot be reasoned with.
- **Brute Force:** Direct combat is expected.
- **Deception:** Could lure undead away from fence (clever!).

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- If undead breach the fence, they attack 1d4 villagers before the party can respond. The party can still save most people.
- If a PC dies, they can be resurrected at the Temple (Father Thomas is still alive at this point) or their body rises as a zombie enemy.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** The village is shaken but safe. Father Thomas (or Sister Elara) purifies the cemetery at dawn. The party is hailed as heroes twice over.

**If Failed:** Several villagers died. The mood is grim. Some blame the party for bringing the Shard.

**If Partial Success:** The village survives but with casualties. Bittersweet victory.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- The cemetery is considered "cursed" and villagers avoid it.
- The Shard's danger is now known; pressure mounts to do something about it.
- The Specter's whispers about "the Temple" foreshadow Adventure 2.

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. The Specter's words: "The silence... in the Temple... releases me..."
2. The Thornwood family—who were they, and why is their crypt blessed?

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| [[Gravedigger Hemlock]] | Grateful, loyal | Dead or traumatized |
| Villagers | Safe | 1d4 dead |
| [[Specter of Thornwood]] | Destroyed | Returns stronger in future |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Build tension between waves. Describe the sounds of scratching, moaning, and the cold wind.
- If the party has the Shard, emphasize its glow and heat whenever undead are near.
- This is a straightforward combat encounter; keep the pace fast.

### Pacing Suggestions
- Act 1 should be frantic—the rush to the cemetery.
- Act 2 is wave combat; give brief rests between waves for healing.
- Act 3 should feel climactic; the Specter is the threat they've been building toward.

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to destroy the Shard | DC 20 Arcana to contain it; ends the rising early |
| Search the crypt mid-fight | Risk attacks of opportunity; find Holy Water |
| Flee back to the village | Undead follow; endangers villagers |
| Try to turn undead | Very effective; use standard rules |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:** Reduce zombie HP by half; remove one skeleton from Wave 3.

**For Stronger Parties:** Add a second Specter (manifestation of a different buried evil); increase zombie numbers.

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- The Specter's whispers about "the Temple" and "the silence" foreshadow **The Silent Bell**.
- The Shard's behavior demonstrates its danger, setting up future decisions about what to do with it.

## Secrets

1. The Thornwood family were secret worshippers of the Lawgiver who hid their faith during a period of persecution; their crypt's blessing is their legacy.
2. The Specter was not a Thornwood—it was a criminal executed and buried in unconsecrated ground centuries ago. The Shard's energy freed it.
3. If the Shard is buried in the cemetery, it will corrupt the blessed ground over time, creating a worse problem later.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. The party returns from the Old Echo Mine with the Shard (or after killing Groz).
2. The necrotic energy needs time to build—this happens the first night after the mine adventure.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. The Specter's words lead directly to **The Silent Bell**—something is wrong at the Temple.
2. The Shard's behavior prompts research—a sage might know more (future quest).
3. The Thornwood family history could lead to a hidden treasure or ally.

## Notes
This adventure serves as a "bridge" between The Whispering Caves and The Silent Bell, demonstrating that the Shard's influence extends beyond the mine. It's designed to be fast-paced and action-oriented, giving the party a taste of horror before the more investigation-focused second adventure.
