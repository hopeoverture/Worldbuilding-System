> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
The party stands before the **Obsidian Fortress**, a massive structure built by the Architects to guard the **Prison of the Imprisoned**, now occupied and fortified by the Covenant. The final seal is breaking. To stop the ritual, the party must infiltrate the fortress, sabotage the four **Elemental Lodestones** powering the barrier override, and open the path to the inner chamber.
