# The Obsidian Gate

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
The party has crossed [[The Sundered Peaks]] and now stands before the Obsidian Fortress, the ancient prison-citadel built by the Architects of Dawn to contain [[The Shackled God]]. The [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] has fortified the structure with four Elemental Lodestones that generate an impenetrable barrier around the inner sanctum where the First Seal lies. To reach [[The Prophet of Chains]] and stop the final ritual, the party must infiltrate through the fortress's geothermal vents, sabotage each Lodestone, and confront Warden Thrax to lower the Inner Shield. Time is running out: the seal cracks wider with each passing hour.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Infiltration / Dungeon Crawl

**Tone:** High Stakes / Military / Desperate

**Themes:**
- The belly of the beast
- Breaking the unbreakable
- Sacrifice and determination
- The calm before the storm

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 3 Sessions

**Party Level:** 10

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Deadly

**Combat Frequency:** High

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Low

**Exploration Emphasis:** Moderate

## The Hook

### How It Begins
Having survived the crossing of [[The Sundered Peaks]] and defeated (or evaded) [[Cryonax]] the white dragon, the party descends into a volcanic caldera where the Obsidian Fortress rises from pools of magma. Their guide, a freed dwarf prisoner named Borin Chainbreaker, leads them to the "Service Entrance" - a ventilation shaft for the fortress's geothermal tap that the Covenant believes is too dangerous to guard heavily.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** Self-Motivated (The fate of the world)

**Motivation:** The [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] nears success. The First Seal binding [[The Shackled God]] will break within days if the ritual continues. There is no one else.

**What They Offer:** Survival. The chance to prevent an apocalypse. No external reward - this is about saving everything.

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The Inner Shield is generated by four Elemental Lodestones (Fire, Air, Water, Earth) positioned at cardinal points around the fortress
- Each Lodestone must be destroyed to lower the shield protecting the Seal Chamber
- Warden Thrax commands the fortress garrison and controls the shield from the Command Spire
- Borin knows the general layout but hasn't been to the upper levels in three years
- The fortress holds roughly 350 enemies: cultists, thralls, and summoned creatures

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Critical

**Consequences of Delay:** Every hour of delay allows the ritual to progress. If the party takes more than 24 hours inside the fortress, the First Seal cracks catastrophically, releasing a pulse of corrupting energy across the continent and making the final confrontation significantly harder.

## Background

### The Situation
The Obsidian Fortress is the ancient prison-citadel built by the Architects of Dawn to guard the First Seal binding [[The Shackled God]]. For centuries it stood abandoned after the last Seal Guardians chose undeath to maintain their vigil. Twenty years ago, [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] discovered the fortress through the Deep Roads and began their work to break the seal. High Priest Malchar leads the seal-breaking operation in the depths, while Warden Thrax commands the military garrison above. The four Elemental Lodestones were installed five years ago to create an impenetrable barrier around the inner sanctum - a final defense against any who might interfere with the liberation of their god.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- The Architects built the fortress during the Age of Myth to guard the prison
- The Seal Guardians protected it for millennia until their line failed
- The Covenant discovered the site in 1967 RS and infiltrated through the Deep Roads
- The Elemental Lodestones were constructed over three years using captured elementals
- Warden Thrax arrived two years ago to militarize the operation as the ritual entered its final phase

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| Warden Thrax | Protect the Lodestones until the ritual completes | Military force, brutal efficiency |
| High Priest Malchar | Complete the Rite of Unbinding | Continuous ritual work in the Seal Chamber |
| Borin Chainbreaker | Escape and see the Covenant destroyed | Guiding the party, providing intelligence |
| The Whisperer | Serve the Covenant and grow stronger | Hunting intruders, consuming souls |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** The Inner Shield falls. The path to the Seal Chamber opens. The party can proceed to confront [[The Prophet of Chains]] and stop the ritual in [[Echoes of the First Shadow]].

**If the party fails:** The First Seal breaks. [[The Shackled God]]'s influence spreads across the continent. Shadow creatures pour through rifts at every seal-point. The final battle becomes exponentially harder - or impossible.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Destroy the four Elemental Lodestones (Fire, Air, Water, Earth) to lower the Inner Shield protecting the Seal Chamber.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Free the prisoners in the Slave Pits to create a distraction
2. Recover intelligence documents from the Command Spire
3. Kill or capture Warden Thrax (rather than simply bypassing him)
4. Find and destroy the Covenant's emergency communication crystals to prevent warning other cells

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Borin's hidden agenda: he wants to recover the body of his brother, who died in the fortress three years ago
2. The Counter-Seal ritual instructions are carved on walls in the Seal Chamber (covered by Covenant writings) - discovering this provides an advantage in the final adventure

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- All four Elemental Lodestones are destroyed
- The Inner Shield collapses
- The party survives and reaches the entrance to the Seal Chamber

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- Total party kill
- All four Lodestones not destroyed within 24 hours
- The party retreats without completing the objective (the Covenant will increase defenses)

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Geothermal Depths
**Goal:** Infiltrate the fortress through the volcanic underbelly and reach the main levels.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Magma Tube:** The party descends through a ventilation shaft into the geothermal tap - a massive chamber where lava flows are channeled to power the fortress. They must navigate catwalks above molten rock while Fire Mephits and Magma Elementals patrol.
2. **The Heat Exchange:** A puzzle/skill challenge involving redirecting steam valves to open a passage while avoiding scalding vents.
3. **The Slave Pits:** The party discovers prisoners (captured dwarves, explorers, and villagers) being worked to death in the lower levels. Freeing them creates a valuable distraction but risks alerting the garrison.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The Fire Lodestone is nearby, in the Furnace Chamber
- The fortress layout: Fire below, then Water and Earth on the main level, Air at the top
- Warden Thrax conducts inspections every six hours - the next one is in four hours

**Transition to Act 2:** After dealing with the Fire Lodestone, the party must ascend to the main fortress level to tackle the remaining three.

### Act 2: The Lodestones
**Goal:** Systematically destroy the four Elemental Lodestones while evading or defeating the garrison.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Furnace Chamber (Fire Lodestone):** A massive bound Fire Elemental writhes inside a crystalline prison, radiating intense heat. The chamber itself deals damage to anyone who enters.
2. **The Cistern (Water Lodestone):** A flooded chamber where a Water Elemental swirls in an endless vortex, creating treacherous currents and drowning hazards.
3. **The Seismic Vault (Earth Lodestone):** A chamber of living stone where guards with tremorsense patrol, and the Earth Elemental causes localized earthquakes.
4. **The Sky Spire (Air Lodestone):** A tower open to the howling mountain winds, with the Air Elemental on a floating platform that constantly shifts position.

**Rising Tension:**
- After the first Lodestone falls, alarms sound throughout the fortress
- After the second, Warden Thrax personally leads hunting parties
- After the third, the fortress goes into full lockdown and The Whisperer is released

**Midpoint Twist:** When the party destroys the second Lodestone, they discover that the Lodestones are powered by bound elemental spirits who were once allied with the Architects. Destroying them is necessary but tragic - the elementals thank the party as they die, freed from millennia of torment.

**Transition to Act 3:** With three Lodestones destroyed, the Inner Shield flickers but holds. Warden Thrax retreats to the Command Spire to make a final stand, knowing that if the party reaches him, the operation is lost.

### Act 3: The High Commander
**Goal:** Confront Warden Thrax in the Command Spire and destroy the final Lodestone to lower the Inner Shield.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Gauntlet:** The approach to the Command Spire is heavily fortified with traps, elite guards, and the released Whisperer hunting the party.
2. **The Command Spire:** Thrax makes his stand in the fortress's nerve center, surrounded by his elite Shadowguard and the mechanism controlling the Air Lodestone.

**Climactic Encounter:** Warden Thrax, a fallen antipaladin who sold his soul to the Covenant for power, fights to the death. He cannot allow the party to reach the Seal Chamber - not because he believes in the cause, but because failure means his soul is forfeit.

**Resolution Options:**
- Combat: Defeat Thrax and his guards, then destroy the final Lodestone
- Tactical: Use the environment (the exposed Air Lodestone's energies) against the defenders
- Desperate: If near defeat, the party can attempt to destroy the Lodestone mid-battle, accepting the chaotic consequences

## Locations

### Overview Map
The Obsidian Fortress is built into and around a volcanic caldera in the Sundered Peaks. The lowest levels tap geothermal energy. The main level contains the garrison, supplies, and three of the four Lodestones. The Command Spire rises above, housing the Air Lodestone. The Seal Chamber lies beneath everything, accessible only when the Inner Shield falls.

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[The Obsidian Fortress]]

**Description:** A cyclopean structure of black volcanic glass and darker stone, impossible geometry suggesting builders who thought in more than three dimensions. Red lightning constantly arcs between spires. The air smells of sulfur and ozone. The walls are warm to the touch, thrumming with contained power.

**Key Features:**
- Non-Euclidean architecture that occasionally confuses navigation
- Constant low hum from the bound elementals
- Temperature variations warning of nearby Lodestones
- Ancient Architect glyphs that glow faintly, remnants of the original wardings

**Encounters Here:** Covenant cultists, shadow-touched thralls, summoned creatures, Warden Thrax's Shadowguard

### Location 2: The Geothermal Tap
**Description:** A vast chamber carved from obsidian where channels of magma flow through engineered conduits. Metal catwalks span the molten rivers, often slick with mineral deposits. The heat is oppressive - over 120 degrees in many areas. Massive turbine-like structures harvest the thermal energy.

**Key Features:**
- Catwalks with gaps, loose bolts, and heat-warped sections
- Steam vents that erupt periodically
- Magma channels that can be diverted with the right controls
- Ancient Architect machinery still functioning after millennia

**Encounters Here:** Fire Mephits (6), Magma Elemental (1), Cult Workers (non-combatant)

### Location 3: The Lodestone Chambers
**Description:** Four chambers positioned at the cardinal points of the fortress, each containing a massive crystalline structure imprisoning a bound elemental. Each chamber reflects its element: the Fire chamber is a furnace, the Water chamber is flooded, the Earth chamber is a cavern of living stone, and the Air chamber is an open-topped spire.

**Key Features:**
- The Lodestones themselves: 10-foot crystalline prisms crackling with elemental energy
- Environmental hazards reflecting each element
- Control mechanisms that could theoretically release the elementals safely (DC 25 Arcana check)
- Covenant modifications covering original Architect inscriptions

**Encounters Here:** Elemental guardians, Covenant priests, element-specific hazards

### Location 4: The Command Spire
**Description:** A twisted tower rising from the fortress's center, housing Warden Thrax's quarters and the central command post. The walls are lined with communication crystals (most now dark as distant cells have been destroyed) and a massive viewing crystal that shows the entire fortress. The Air Lodestone's control mechanism dominates the upper chamber.

**Key Features:**
- Tactical displays showing garrison positions
- Communication array connecting to surviving Covenant cells
- Thrax's personal armory and trophies
- The Air Lodestone access mechanism (destroying it destroys the Lodestone)

**Encounters Here:** Warden Thrax, Elite Shadowguard (6), trap mechanisms

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Geothermal Tap | Fire Lodestone | 500 ft | Patrols, heat |
| Fire Lodestone | Main Level | 400 ft | Vertical climb, guards |
| Main Level | Water Lodestone | 600 ft | Flooded sections |
| Main Level | Earth Lodestone | 600 ft | Tremors, patrols |
| Main Level | Command Spire | 800 ft | Heavy security |
| Command Spire | Air Lodestone | In spire | The Whisperer |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### Borin Chainbreaker
**Role:** Guide and information source

**Description:** A grey-bearded dwarf with haunted eyes and extensive scarring from three years of forced labor. His spirit is unbroken despite everything he's suffered. He knows the lower levels intimately and has spent years memorizing guard rotations while planning an escape that never came.

**Personality:** Grim, determined, occasionally dark humor. He's grateful to be free but consumed by survivor's guilt and a burning need for vengeance.

**What They Want:** To see the Covenant destroyed, and to recover his brother Thorin's body from the collapsed tunnel where he died.

**What They Know:** Lower level layout, guard rotations (may be outdated), prisoner locations, weakness in the Fire Lodestone's containment

**How They Can Help:** Guides the party through the lower levels, can rally freed prisoners for distraction, knows a hidden route bypassing one patrol checkpoint

### Neutrals

#### The Bound Elementals
**Role:** Tragic prisoners

**Description:** Four ancient elementals who once allied with the Architects, tricked into eternal servitude by Covenant magic. They are conscious, suffering, and have been for millennia.

**Personality:** Varies by element - Fire is raging, Water is sorrowful, Earth is stoic, Air is maddened

**What They Want:** Freedom, even if it means death

**Attitude Toward Party:** Initially hostile (compelled to defend themselves), becoming grateful when the party offers release

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: Warden Thrax
**Role:** Fortress Commander

**Description:** A massive human male standing nearly seven feet tall, encased in blackened plate armor inscribed with Covenant symbols that occasionally writhe. His face is cruel and handsome, marred by ritual scarification. A cloak of shadow constantly billows behind him despite no wind. His voice resonates with unnatural depth. He was once a paladin of the Silver Flame before his fall - he still carries their martial discipline, now twisted to dark purpose.

**Personality:** Cruel, disciplined, pragmatic. He takes no pleasure in cruelty but accepts it as necessary. Deep down, he fears what he's become but sees no path back.

**Motivation:** Survival. He sold his soul to the Covenant and knows that failure means eternal torment. He doesn't believe in the Shackled God's cause - he simply has no choice but to serve.

**Methods:** Military precision, brutal efficiency, strategic thinking. He will sacrifice minions without hesitation but positions himself carefully, never fighting fair when ambush is available.

**Weakness:** His former faith. Holy symbols still cause him psychic pain. Mention of his past as a paladin provokes rage that clouds his judgment. He cannot set foot in the Seal Chamber - the divine energy there would destroy him.

**Combat Notes:** Use Antipaladin or Death Knight statistics (adjusted to CR 10). He wields a +2 greatsword that deals necrotic damage. His Unholy Smite deals 4d8 necrotic damage. He has Legendary Resistance (2/day).

#### Secondary Antagonist: The Whisperer
**Role:** Assassin and hunter

**Description:** A creature of living darkness, bound by the Covenant to serve their leaders. It has no fixed form, manifesting as shifting shadows with too many eyes. It cannot exist in direct sunlight but is nearly unstoppable in darkness. Its voice is a susurrus of overlapping whispers that speak your deepest fears.

**Connection to Primary:** The Whisperer serves whoever commands the fortress. It respects Thrax's strength but holds no loyalty - it serves because it must.

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Magma Tubes
**Location:** Geothermal Tap

**Trigger:** Entering the main tap chamber

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Fire Mephit | 6 | Flying, scattered across chamber |
| Magma Elemental | 1 | Emerges from lava if combat starts |
| Cult Worker | 8 | Non-combatant, flee or surrender |

**Tactics:** Mephits harry the party from range, trying to knock them off catwalks. The Magma Elemental submerges and attacks from below, grabbing legs and pulling victims toward the lava.

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Terrain Features:** Narrow catwalks (5 ft wide), lava 30 ft below (10d10 fire damage), steam vents (2d6 fire damage, DC 14 Dex save), control levers that redirect lava flow

**Rewards:** Access to lower levels, information from captured workers

#### Encounter 2: The Fire Lodestone
**Location:** Furnace Chamber

**Trigger:** Approaching the Lodestone

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Fire Elemental (bound) | 1 | Compelled to defend, freed when Lodestone destroyed |
| Cult Priest | 1 | Maintains binding |
| Cult Warrior | 4 | Guards |

**Tactics:** The priest maintains concentration on the binding; if broken, the Fire Elemental goes berserk for 1 round before turning on the cultists. Warriors form a defensive line.

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Terrain Features:** Extreme heat (Constitution save DC 14 every 10 minutes or gain exhaustion), the Lodestone deals 3d6 fire damage to anyone within 10 feet

**Rewards:** First Lodestone destroyed, Fire Elemental's gratitude (grants fire resistance for 1 hour as blessing)

#### Encounter 3: The Water Lodestone
**Location:** The Cistern

**Trigger:** Entering the flooded chamber

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Water Elemental (bound) | 1 | Creates whirlpools |
| Water Weird | 2 | Hidden in the current |
| Cult Priest | 1 | On a dry platform |

**Tactics:** The flooded chamber forces most movement to be swimming. The Water Elemental creates currents that drag victims toward the Lodestone. Water Weirds ambush anyone who gets close to the priest's platform.

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Terrain Features:** 15-foot-deep water, strong currents (Strength save DC 14 to swim against), the Lodestone at the bottom of a 30-foot whirlpool, air pockets in the ceiling

**Rewards:** Second Lodestone destroyed, Water Elemental's blessing (water breathing for 1 hour)

#### Encounter 4: The Earth Lodestone
**Location:** Seismic Vault

**Trigger:** The Earth Elemental senses footsteps through the stone

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Earth Elemental (bound) | 1 | Has tremorsense 120 ft |
| Cult Warrior | 6 | Also have tremorsense (magical boots) |
| Galeb Duhr | 2 | Disguised as boulders |

**Tactics:** The defenders know the party's position through tremorsense. Stealth is nearly impossible. The Earth Elemental causes localized earthquakes, while Galeb Duhr ambush from concealment.

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Terrain Features:** Difficult terrain (rubble), periodic earthquakes (DC 14 Dex save or fall prone, triggers every round the Earth Elemental is present), stalactites that can be collapsed (4d10 bludgeoning)

**Rewards:** Third Lodestone destroyed, Earth Elemental's blessing (tremorsense 30 ft for 1 hour)

#### Encounter 5: The Whisperer
**Location:** The gauntlet approaching Command Spire (or wherever the party is weakest)

**Trigger:** After three Lodestones are destroyed

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| The Whisperer | 1 | Shadow creature, CR 9 |

**Tactics:** The Whisperer doesn't fight fairly. It stalks the party through shadows, targeting isolated characters. It causes fear, strikes, and retreats. It cannot be permanently killed while in darkness - it reforms in 1d4 rounds unless destroyed in bright light.

**Difficulty:** Deadly (if caught alone), Medium (if prepared with light)

**Terrain Features:** Deep shadows throughout the fortress. The Whisperer avoids areas of bright light entirely.

**Rewards:** If destroyed, ends its threat. Contains a shadow-infused gem worth 500 gp that can be used to cast Darkness once per day.

#### Boss Encounter: Warden Thrax
**Location:** Command Spire, upper chamber

**Setup:** Thrax has barricaded the chamber, surrounded by his elite Shadowguard. The Air Lodestone's control mechanism dominates the center of the room. Windows are open to the howling mountain wind - the Air Elemental swirls outside, visible as a raging vortex. Thrax knows the party is coming and has prepared.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Warden Thrax | 1 | CR 10 Antipaladin |
| Elite Shadowguard | 6 | Veterans with shadow-touched weapons |
| Air Elemental (partial) | 1 | Lashes through windows if Lodestone mechanism activated |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 (100% - 50% HP):** Thrax fights defensively, letting his Shadowguard engage while he uses ranged attacks and commands. He orders focused fire on spellcasters. If the party tries to destroy the mechanism, he uses his reaction to intercept.
2. **Phase 2 (Below 50% HP):** Thrax becomes desperate. He uses Unholy Smite liberally, fights recklessly, and may intentionally trigger the Air Elemental to attack everyone (including his own troops) as a last resort.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:**
- **Legendary Action (1):** Move up to half speed without provoking opportunity attacks
- **Legendary Action (2):** Make one weapon attack
- **Legendary Action (2):** Cast Command (one target)
- **Lair Action:** Once per round, Thrax can command a mechanism that channels the Air Lodestone's energy - a line of lightning (8d6 damage, DC 16 Dex save for half) that strikes through the room

**Victory Conditions:** Destroy Thrax or the Air Lodestone mechanism. Once the mechanism is destroyed, the Air Elemental is freed and destroys the Lodestone from outside before dispersing - the Inner Shield falls.

**Rewards:** +2 Greatsword (Shadow-Touched), Thrax's armor (can be cleansed to create +1 plate armor with resistance to necrotic damage), Command Spire intelligence documents, 2,000 gp in coins and gems

### Social Encounters

#### Negotiating with Prisoners
**Location:** The Slave Pits

**NPCs Present:** 35 prisoners (dwarves, humans, half-elves), including Borin's contact Gretta Ironjaw

**Stakes:** Freed prisoners can create a massive distraction, but if handled poorly, they'll flee immediately or be recaptured

**Information Available:** Guard rotations, food storage locations, a hidden armory the prisoners have been secretly stocking

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 14 | Prisoners agree to staged uprising | Prisoners flee at first opportunity |
| Intimidation | 16 | Prisoners follow orders precisely | Prisoners turn on party later |
| Insight | 12 | Identify the natural leaders | Waste time convincing wrong people |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Prisoners launch coordinated uprising at party's signal, drawing 40% of garrison to lower levels
- Moderate: Prisoners escape noisily, drawing some attention but chaotically
- Worst: Prisoners are recaptured or killed, garrison is alerted to intruders

### Exploration Challenges

#### The Heat Exchange
**Location:** Between Geothermal Tap and Fire Lodestone

**Description:** A puzzle chamber where ancient Architect mechanisms control steam flow. The party must redirect steam through the correct sequence of valves to open the path forward - and avoid being scalded.

**Skills Useful:** Investigation (find control sequence carved in walls), Arcana (understand the mechanism), Athletics (turn stuck valves), Thieves' Tools (bypass damaged controls)

**Hazards:** Steam jets (3d6 fire damage, DC 15 Dex save), superheated metal (1d6 fire damage per round of contact), pressure buildup if solved incorrectly (6d6 fire damage to room)

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:** Hidden cache of Architect tools (provide advantage on checks to disable Lodestones), health potions left by previous adventurers who didn't survive

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Lodestone locations | Borin's briefing / Slave Pits | Conversation | Planning approach route |
| Patrol schedules | Slave Pits | Rescued prisoner intel | Timing infiltration |
| Thrax's weakness (holy symbols) | Command Spire documents / Thrax's quarters | Investigation | Combat advantage |
| The Whisperer's nature | After first Lodestone | Cult priest's notes | Preparing light sources |
| Counter-Seal instructions exist | Earth Lodestone chamber | DC 18 Perception, scraping on walls | Advantage in next adventure |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. A cultist "defector" who offers to help - actually leading the party into an ambush
2. A secret passage that appears to bypass the Command Spire but leads to The Whisperer's lair

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The bound elementals were once allies, not enemies. They helped the Architects build this prison willingly - and were betrayed into eternal servitude when the work was done.

**When It's Revealed:** When the party destroys the second Lodestone and the dying elemental speaks, thanking them for freedom

**Impact:** Raises moral questions about the nature of the Architects and their methods. Foreshadows the complex morality of what lies in the prison below.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Shadow Glyph | All Lodestone chamber doors | Opening without password | Necrotic burst | 16 Dex | 4d10 necrotic |
| Pressure Plate | Corridor to Command Spire | Weight | Crossbow volley | 15 Dex | 3d10 piercing |
| Alarm Sigil | Various thresholds | Crossing without Covenant mark | Alerts garrison | 17 Int (Arcana) to spot | None (alarm) |
| Pit Trap | Main level corridors | Weight | 30 ft fall into spike pit | 14 Dex | 3d6 piercing + 2d6 fall |
| Fire Jet | Geothermal Tap catwalks | Timed (every 3 rounds) | Flame burst | 15 Dex | 4d6 fire |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Extreme Heat | Geothermal areas | Exhaustion (DC 14 Con save every 10 min) | Cold resistance, cooling magic |
| Drowning | Water Lodestone chamber | Suffocation | Water breathing |
| Altitude Sickness | Command Spire | Disadvantage on Con saves | Slow ascent, magic |
| Anti-Magic Zones | Near Lodestones | Spells suppressed within 10 ft | Physical solutions |
| Shadow Zones | Throughout fortress | Darkvision reduced to 30 ft | Light sources |

### Puzzles

#### The Steam Labyrinth
**Location:** Heat Exchange

**Description:** A room filled with pipes, valves, and steam vents. The exit is blocked by a massive gear that requires pressure to turn. Four colored valves (red, blue, yellow, green) must be turned in the correct sequence while avoiding the resulting steam blasts.

**Solution:** The sequence is carved in Architect glyphs on the ceiling (DC 15 Investigation to find): Blue-Red-Yellow-Green. Each valve releases steam from a different vent - characters must move between safe zones.

**Hints:**
- Dwarvish characters recognize the engineering style and gain advantage on checks
- The correct sequence spells "DAWN" in Architect symbolic language
- Trial and error is possible but each wrong attempt triggers a steam blast

**Bypass Options:** DC 20 Strength to force the gear mechanism, DC 18 Thieves' Tools to release pressure without the valves, destroying the mechanism (but alerting guards with the noise)

## Rewards

### Treasure

#### Monetary
**Total Value:** Approximately 5,000 gp throughout the fortress

**Distribution:**
| Location | Contents | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Thrax's quarters | Coins, gems, looted jewelry | 2,000 gp |
| Armory | Sellable weapons and armor | 1,500 gp |
| Cult Priests' chambers | Ritual components (valuable to right buyer) | 800 gp |
| Hidden prisoner cache | Confiscated adventurer gear | 700 gp |

#### Magic Items
| Item | Location | Guarded By |
|------|----------|------------|
| +2 Greatsword (Shadow-Touched) | Thrax's hand | Warden Thrax |
| Cloak of Elvenkind | Hidden prisoner cache | None (hidden) |
| Ring of Fire Resistance | Fire Cult Priest | Fire Lodestone guards |
| Potion of Water Breathing (3) | Cistern control room | Water Lodestone guards |
| Boots of Tremorsense | Earth Cult Priest | Earth Lodestone guards |
| Bag of Holding | Thrax's quarters | Thrax |

### Quest Rewards
**From Quest Giver:** None (self-motivated quest)

**Additional Rewards:**
- Borin Chainbreaker's eternal gratitude and service as an ally
- Intelligence documents revealing Covenant cell locations
- Clear path to the Seal Chamber for the final adventure

### Experience
**Combat XP:** Approximately 18,000 XP total across all encounters (varies by approach)

**Non-Combat XP:** 4,000 XP for puzzles, exploration, and freeing prisoners

**Milestone Advancement:** Upon lowering the Inner Shield and reaching the Seal Chamber entrance, the party advances to Level 11.

### Intangible Rewards
- **Reputation:** Word spreads of heroes who breached the Obsidian Fortress
- **Allies Gained:** Freed prisoners (potential future army), Borin Chainbreaker as permanent ally
- **Information Learned:** Covenant command structure, locations of other cells, the Prophet's approximate location
- **Story Hooks:** The Counter-Seal ritual, the nature of the Architects' bargains, Thrax's former order (the Silver Flame may want his sword returned)

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Free prisoners? | Yes: distraction / No: stealth preserved | Yes: easier infiltration, harder extraction / No: harder infiltration, cleaner extraction |
| Order of Lodestones? | Fire-Water-Earth-Air (recommended) or other | Different combinations affect which enemies respond where |
| Kill or capture Thrax? | Kill: faster / Capture: intelligence | Kill: lose intel / Capture: risk escape, gain Covenant secrets |
| Destroy or disable Lodestones? | Destroy: permanent / Disable: possible reversal | Destroy: frees elementals / Disable: faster but shield could be restored |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Possible but difficult. The party can avoid most combat through careful timing and use of the prisoner distraction. Requires creative solutions for Lodestones (which must still be destroyed).
- **Diplomacy:** Very limited. No one in the fortress will negotiate in good faith. However, the bound elementals can be communicated with, potentially gaining their active assistance rather than just destroying them.
- **Brute Force:** Possible but costly. The party can fight through everything, but resource attrition becomes critical. Recommend only for well-prepared parties with strong healing.
- **Deception:** Moderate potential. Capturing cult robes and using Disguise Self or similar magic allows passage through some areas, but any Lodestone chamber visit will trigger combat.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- **Captured:** The party is taken to the Slave Pits. Borin can help them escape, but the fortress is now on high alert.
- **Retreat:** If the party must retreat without completing the mission, they have 12 hours before the Covenant strengthens defenses enough to make re-entry nearly impossible. Use that time to rest and return.
- **Partial Success:** If only some Lodestones are destroyed, the Inner Shield is weakened but not down. A desperate assault on the Seal Chamber is possible but faces resistance from the remaining elemental(s).

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** The Inner Shield collapses with a thunderous crack. The path to the Seal Chamber opens. The party can see the violet glow of the weakening First Seal below - and hear the chanting of cultists completing the Rite of Unbinding. There's no time to rest: the final confrontation begins.

**If Failed:** The First Seal cracks catastrophically. A pulse of shadow energy explodes outward, corrupting everything within five miles. The party must flee the collapsing fortress. The final adventure becomes a desperate attempt to contain the damage rather than prevent it.

**If Partial Success:** The Shield is weakened but holds. The party must find another way in - perhaps through the Deep Roads entrance - or attempt to breach the damaged shield directly (possible but dangerous).

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- The Covenant's military arm is broken. Even if the Prophet survives, they cannot rebuild their fortress.
- The freed prisoners spread word of what's happening in the mountains. The world learns the threat is real.
- The destruction of the Lodestones releases elemental energy into the mountain - volcanic activity in the region increases.
- [[The Iron Holds]] learn of the Covenant's use of their Deep Roads and seal the passages permanently.

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. The Counter-Seal ritual instructions: What exactly do they say? Who can perform the ritual?
2. Thrax's former order: [[The Order of the Silver Flame]] wants to know what happened to their fallen champion - and whether he can be redeemed in death.
3. The Whisperer's origin: Where did this shadow creature come from? Are there more like it?

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Borin Chainbreaker | Escapes, becomes party ally, leads dwarf survivors home | Recaptured, executed as example |
| Warden Thrax | Dead, soul claimed by the Shackled God | Survives, promoted to lead expanded operations |
| The Whisperer | Destroyed or fled, threat ended | Grows stronger on the chaos, becomes greater threat |
| Freed Prisoners | Return home as witnesses, some join resistance | Killed or transformed into shadow thralls |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Pace the Lodestone encounters to build tension - each should feel harder than the last
- Use the bound elementals' tragedy to add moral weight to what could otherwise be simple "destroy the objective" gameplay
- Warden Thrax should be built up as a threatening presence before the final fight - have guards mention him fearfully, show evidence of his cruelty
- The 24-hour time limit should feel present but not oppressive - give the party enough time to explore but remind them the ritual continues

### Pacing Suggestions
- Session 1: Infiltration through Geothermal Tap, Fire Lodestone, Slave Pits encounter, Water Lodestone
- Session 2: Earth Lodestone, The Whisperer pursuit, approach to Command Spire
- Session 3: Gauntlet, Thrax confrontation, Shield collapse, transition to final adventure

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to long rest inside the fortress | Patrols eventually find them. Allow one long rest with a random encounter, but two attempts triggers major response |
| Split up to tackle Lodestones simultaneously | High risk, high reward. Each group faces full encounter but time pressure is reduced |
| Try to negotiate with Thrax | He pretends to consider, then attacks when guard is down. He cannot surrender - his soul depends on success |
| Attempt to free elementals without destroying Lodestones | DC 25 Arcana check. Success frees the elemental, who destroys the Lodestone themselves. Failure triggers explosion |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Reduce Lodestone guard numbers by 2 each
- Remove The Whisperer (it fled when the first Lodestone fell)
- Give Thrax only 1 Legendary Resistance
- Freed prisoners provide more direct combat support

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add a priest to each Lodestone chamber
- The Whisperer reforms twice before being permanently destroyed
- Thrax has lair actions in addition to legendary actions
- The 24-hour deadline is reduced to 12 hours

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- Mention that High Priest Malchar is in the Seal Chamber - the party will face him in [[Echoes of the First Shadow]]
- If the party examines the Counter-Seal inscriptions, hint that the ritual requires components they've already gathered (the Shards of Shadow, Dawn Key, Sunstone)
- The Shackled God's presence grows stronger as Lodestones fall - describe creeping dread, whispered promises, visions at the edge of perception

## Secrets

1. **The Architects' Bargain:** The elementals weren't tricked - they volunteered for eternal servitude because the Architects promised it would end when the Shackled God was truly destroyed, not just imprisoned. They've been waiting for someone to finish what the Architects couldn't.

2. **Thrax's Damnation:** Warden Thrax's soul isn't bound to the Covenant - it's bound to the Shackled God directly. If the God is destroyed, Thrax would be freed. If the party could make him understand this, he might turn on his masters. But his fear and despair have made him incapable of hope.

3. **The Fifth Lodestone:** There was originally a fifth Lodestone - Spirit - that would have made the shield truly impenetrable. It was never installed because the elemental they tried to bind destroyed itself rather than serve. The Covenant doesn't know how close they came to perfect defense.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. [[Into the Sundered Peaks]] - The party crossed the mountains and defeated or bypassed Cryonax, receiving directions to the fortress
2. Rescued Borin Chainbreaker during the Sundered Peaks crossing, gaining a guide
3. Intelligence gathered during [[Siege of the Grey Keep]] revealed the fortress's layout and defenses

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. [[Echoes of the First Shadow]] - Immediate continuation as the party descends to confront the Prophet
2. The Counter-Seal ritual - if discovered, provides a path to victory beyond simply killing the Prophet
3. Borin's oath of service - the dwarf offers to serve as the party's retainer, providing future quest hooks involving the Iron Holds
4. The Silver Flame's inquiry - the order wants to know what became of their fallen knight

## Notes
- This adventure serves as the penultimate challenge before the campaign climax
- The emphasis is on action and tension rather than roleplay - the party has spent two acts building to this moment
- The bound elemental tragedy adds moral complexity without slowing the pace
- Warden Thrax should feel like a genuine threat - a fallen champion, not just another cultist boss
- The transition to the final adventure should feel seamless - "the shield falls, you see the seal below, there's no time to rest"
