# The Refugee Caravan

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A war-themed escort mission set during the Covenant's advance on the Grey Keep. This interlude connects The Forgotten Shrine to the Siege of the Grey Keep, introducing the party to the human cost of war while testing their ability to protect the vulnerable against mobile enemy forces.

## Overview

War has come to the Borderlands. As the party travels to the **[[Grey Keep]]** carrying the newly acquired **[[The Sunstone|Sunstone]]**, they encounter a desperate caravan of refugees fleeing the **[[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth|Covenant's]]** advance guards. Farmers, craftsmen, and their families have abandoned their villages ahead of the hobgoblin legions, but their slow-moving wagons have attracted attention. **Worg Riders**—Covenant scouts sent to eliminate witnesses and spread terror—are circling closer. The party must defend twelve wagons and over sixty civilians through five miles of exposed road until they reach the safety of the **[[Grey Keep]]'s** walls.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Escort / Defense

**Tone:** Desperate / Heroic

**Themes:**
- The cost of war on innocents
- Leadership under pressure
- The choice between speed and mercy

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** One-Shot (4-5 hours)

**Party Level:** 6

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate

**Combat Frequency:** Moderate (3 combat encounters)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Moderate (refugee interactions, morale management)

**Exploration Emphasis:** Low (linear route)

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party crests a hill on the **[[The High Road|High Road]]** and sees smoke on the horizon—both behind them (burning villages) and ahead (signal fires). Below, a ragged caravan of a dozen wagons has stopped in disarray. A burning supply wagon blocks the rear, and the distant howls of worgs echo across the plains. Screams rise from the caravan as people realize they are being hunted.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** Aldric Cartwright (de facto caravan leader)
**Motivation:** Keep his family and neighbors alive; reach the Grey Keep before nightfall
**What They Offer:** Nothing material—only gratitude and the knowledge that sixty lives depend on the party's choice

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The refugees are from three villages in the eastern Borderlands, fleeing ahead of the Covenant army
- Worg riders have been shadowing the caravan since dawn, picking off stragglers
- The Grey Keep is five miles ahead; it will close its gates at sunset
- One wagon is already burning; the draft horses bolted, and the family is stranded

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Critical

**Consequences of Delay:** Every thirty minutes of delay means another worg rider pack catches up. If the caravan doesn't reach the Keep by sunset (approximately 4 hours), the gates close for the siege, and the refugees are locked outside with the Covenant army.

## Background

### The Situation
**[[Warlord Kragg]]** has sent his worg rider vanguard ahead of the main army to terrorize the population and prevent reinforcements from reaching the **[[Grey Keep]]**. The riders aren't trying to destroy the caravan—they're herding it, preventing the refugees from reaching safety so the main army can capture them as laborers or hostages. The riders will probe, harass, and delay, only committing to a full assault if the caravan seems close to escaping.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- Three days ago, Covenant scouts appeared in the eastern villages
- Two days ago, the villages received word that the main army was one week behind
- Yesterday, the evacuation began; three villages merged into one caravan
- This morning, the worg riders caught up and began their harassment campaign

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| Aldric Cartwright | Get his people to safety | Keep the caravan moving, make hard choices |
| **[[Captain Renna Voss]]** | Delay the caravan until dark | Hit-and-run attacks, targeting draft animals and wheels |
| The Refugees | Survive | Follow whoever seems to know what they're doing |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** Sixty-three civilians reach the Grey Keep. The blacksmith Torgun joins the defenders. The party gains a reputation as protectors. Morale at the Keep improves significantly before the siege.

**If the party fails:** Some or all refugees are captured or killed. The party arrives at the Keep having failed to protect innocents. Morale at the Keep suffers. Captured refugees may appear as hostages during the siege.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Ensure at least 50% of the wagons (6 of 12) reach the **[[Grey Keep]]** before sunset.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Save all twelve wagons (difficult but possible)
2. Kill or drive off **[[Captain Renna Voss]]** to break the riders' coordination
3. Keep civilian casualties below five

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Rescue the Thornwood family stranded at the burning wagon (reveals Mira Thornwood, a hedge witch with useful potions)
2. Identify and protect Torgun the blacksmith—the only one who can repair the Keep's damaged portcullis mechanism

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- At least 6 wagons reach the Grey Keep before the gates close

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- Fewer than 6 wagons survive to reach the Keep
- The party abandons the caravan entirely
- The caravan is still on the road when the sun sets (total capture)

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: Setup
**Goal:** Establish the situation and get the party moving.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Burning Wagon:** The party arrives to find chaos—a supply wagon ablaze, the Thornwood family stranded, and Aldric desperately trying to organize the panicked refugees. The party must decide: help immediately or scout first.
2. **Taking Command:** Someone must lead. The refugees will follow the party if they demonstrate competence. Aldric will defer to anyone who seems to know what they're doing.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The Keep is five miles away
- There are at least a dozen worg riders circling
- The caravan has twelve wagons, sixty-three people, and limited armed defenders (6 villagers with pitchforks)

**Transition to Act 2:** Once the burning wagon situation is resolved and the caravan is moving, the first probe attack begins.

### Act 2: Confrontation
**Goal:** The party faces obstacles and makes progress.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Rear Guard (Combat):** A pack of worgs rushes the stragglers. The party must fight them off while keeping the caravan moving.
2. **The Broken Wheel:** The Hendricks family wagon snaps an axle in a pothole. The party must choose: fix it (30 minutes, skill challenge), abandon it (lose the family's supplies and possibly the family), or redistribute the passengers and cargo (10 minutes, but slows everyone).
3. **The Ridgeline Watchers:** Worg riders appear on the ridge, watching. They don't attack—they're waiting for nightfall. The refugees panic. Someone must calm them (social encounter).

**Rising Tension:** Each hour, the riders grow bolder. More appear on the flanks. The howling grows closer. Refugees begin suggesting they should surrender.

**Midpoint Twist:** A rider approaches under a white flag. **[[Captain Renna Voss]]** offers terms: leave the wagons and walk to the Keep unharmed. She lies—the Covenant wants prisoners, not mercy. But some refugees might believe her.

**Transition to Act 3:** As the Keep comes into view, the riders commit to their final assault—they cannot let the caravan escape.

### Act 3: Resolution
**Goal:** Climax and conclusion.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Ambush:** A roadblock of felled trees blocks the final stretch. Hobgoblin infantry wait in ambush while worg riders hit from behind—a coordinated trap.
2. **The Final Run:** Once the roadblock is cleared, it becomes a desperate sprint. The party must hold the rear while wagons race for the gates.

**Climactic Encounter:** The party faces **[[Captain Renna Voss]]** on her dire wolf mount as she leads a final charge to cut off the lead wagons.

**Resolution Options:**
- Victory: The gates open, soldiers rush out to cover the final wagons, and the refugees collapse in safety
- Partial Victory: Some wagons make it; others are overtaken outside the walls
- Defeat: The caravan is captured within sight of the Keep

## Locations

### Overview Map
The adventure takes place along a five-mile stretch of the **[[The High Road|High Road]]** running through the eastern Borderlands. The road passes through open farmland (miles 1-2), a wooded stretch with a ridge (mile 3), a stream crossing at Millford Bridge (mile 4), and the final approach to the Grey Keep (mile 5).

### Primary Location
**Name:** The High Road

**Description:** A packed-earth trade road wide enough for two wagons abreast, lined with drainage ditches and the occasional milestone. In peacetime, it's the safest route to the Keep. Today, it's a gauntlet.

**Key Features:**
- Open sightlines (good for spotting enemies, bad for hiding)
- Drainage ditches provide light cover
- Milestones mark distance to the Keep

**Encounters Here:** The Rear Guard (Worg attack), The Broken Wheel

### Location 2: The Ridge
**Description:** A wooded rise that parallels the road for half a mile, providing high ground to observers—and ambushers.

**Key Features:**
- Trees block line of sight
- Elevation advantage for archers
- Narrow trail connects to the road

**Encounters Here:** The Ridgeline Watchers (social encounter with refugees)

### Location 3: Millford Bridge
**Description:** A stone bridge crossing a shallow stream. The bridge is solid, but the stream can be forded, making it hard to hold.

**Key Features:**
- Chokepoint for wagons (one at a time)
- Stream is waist-deep, muddy bottom
- Ruined mill provides cover

**Encounters Here:** The Ambush (roadblock and pincer attack)

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Starting Position | The Ridge | 2 miles | Open ground, worg patrols |
| The Ridge | Millford Bridge | 2 miles | Wooded flanks, ambush risk |
| Millford Bridge | Grey Keep | 1 mile | Roadblock, final assault |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### Aldric Cartwright
**Role:** Caravan leader, civilian

**Description:** A middle-aged farmer with calloused hands and worried eyes, Aldric organized the evacuation when the village elders couldn't agree. He's been awake for two days and is running on fear and determination.

**Personality:** Practical, exhausted, prone to self-doubt but steps up when needed

**What They Want:** To get everyone—especially his wife and two children—to safety

**What They Know:** The layout of the road ahead, which families are in which wagon, who has useful skills

**How They Can Help:** Can rally the refugees, make quick decisions about who to save if forced, knows a shortcut (dangerous, through the stream bed)

#### Torgun Ironhammer
**Role:** Blacksmith, essential NPC

**Description:** A barrel-chested dwarf with a singed beard and soot-stained clothes, Torgun was the smith for all three villages. His wagon carries his tools and a small anvil he refused to abandon.

**Personality:** Gruff, practical, refuses to leave his tools behind

**What They Want:** His tools represent his livelihood and identity; he'll die before abandoning them

**What They Know:** How to repair the wagon wheel quickly (if helped), and that the Grey Keep's portcullis mechanism was damaged in a previous raid

**How They Can Help:** Can fix the broken wagon in half the time if the party assists; at the Keep, becomes essential for siege preparations

#### Mira Thornwood
**Role:** Hedge witch, healer

**Description:** A slight woman in her sixties with grey-streaked hair and sharp eyes, Mira was gathering herbs when her family's wagon caught fire. She carries a satchel of medicinal supplies and three healing potions she made herself.

**Personality:** Calm in crisis, sharply observant, protective of her grandchildren

**What They Want:** Her family's safety; will trade potions for protection

**What They Know:** The worg riders are using alchemical accelerants (the fire wasn't natural); she recognizes Covenant tactics

**How They Can Help:** Three *Potions of Healing*, can provide *Goodberry* equivalent once per day, can treat wounds during rest stops

### Neutrals

#### The Refugees (Collective)
**Role:** Protected civilians

**Personality:** Varies—some brave, some cowardly, most just trying to survive

**What They Want:** Safety, certainty, someone to tell them what to do

**Attitude Toward Party:** Initially hopeful, then dependent. Will follow the party's lead unless given reason to distrust them.

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: Captain Renna Voss
**Role:** Worg Rider Pack Leader

**Description:** A lean, scarred woman in leather armor marked with the Covenant's broken-circle symbol, Renna rides a massive grey dire wolf named Fang. She was a ranger before the Covenant recruited her with promises of revenge against the kingdom that executed her brother for poaching. Now she hunts humans instead of deer, and she's very good at it.

**Personality:** Patient, professional, takes no pleasure in killing but shows no mercy

**Motivation:** Prove her worth to the Covenant; capture prisoners for the army; survive to see her brother avenged

**Methods:** Hit-and-run tactics, targeting leaders and draft animals, psychological warfare (howling, circling), negotiating false surrenders

**Weakness:** Overconfident in her mobility advantage; if dismounted or if Fang is killed, she becomes desperate and reckless

**Combat Notes:** Use **Hobgoblin Captain** stats (CR 3) mounted on a **Dire Wolf** (CR 1). She has a *+1 longbow* with 20 arrows and uses *Hunter's Mark* (3/day).

#### Secondary Antagonist: The Worg Rider Pack
**Role:** Pursuing hunters

**Description:** Twelve hobgoblin scouts mounted on worgs, organized into three packs of four. They wear light armor and carry spears and shortbows.

**Connection to Primary:** They follow Renna's commands absolutely; she's proven herself a worthy war-leader. If she falls, they scatter.

## Encounters

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Worg | 4 | No riders; sent to test defenses |
| Hobgoblin Scout | 2 | Observing from 120 ft, will flee if spotted |

**Tactics:** The worgs rush the rear wagons, trying to hamstring the draft horses. They flee if reduced to half HP. The scouts watch to assess party capabilities.

**Difficulty:** Easy-Medium

**Terrain Features:**
- Wagons provide half cover
- Draft horses panic if attacked (DC 12 Animal Handling to calm)
- Drainage ditches provide three-quarters cover if prone

**Trigger:** If the party investigates the watchers or tries to clear the ridge

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Hobgoblin | 4 | Mounted on worgs, hit-and-run |
| Worg | 4 | Mounts |

**Tactics:** They fire arrows from the treeline, then retreat. If pursued, they lead the party on a chase away from the caravan—while another pack attacks the undefended wagons.

**Difficulty:** Medium (the real threat is splitting the party)

**Rewards:** If captured/killed: Covenant orders confirming the army is one day behind, a *Potion of Speed*

#### Encounter 3: The Ambush
**Location:** Millford Bridge, Mile 4

**Trigger:** Automatic when the lead wagon approaches the bridge

**Enemies:**

|----------|--------|-------|
| Hobgoblin | 6 | Infantry at the roadblock |
| Worg Rider | 4 | Attacking from rear |
| Hobgoblin Captain | 1 | Commanding the roadblock |

**Tactics:** The roadblock forces the caravan to stop. Infantry engages anyone trying to clear the logs. Riders hit the rear to prevent retreat. The captain focuses on the party's spellcasters.

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Terrain Features:**
- Felled trees provide full cover
- Stream slows movement (difficult terrain)
- Ruined mill provides elevated position

**Rewards:** *Cloak of Elvenkind* (on the captain), 50 gp in mixed coins

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Captain Renna Voss | 1 | Mounted on Dire Wolf "Fang" |
| Worg Rider | 4-8 | Depending on earlier losses |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 (Chase):** Renna tries to get ahead of the lead wagon and block the gates. The party must intercept her while protecting the caravan.
2. **Phase 2 (Duel):** If blocked, Renna engages the strongest party member directly while her riders attack the wagons.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:** Renna has *Pack Tactics* with Fang. Once per round, she can command Fang to use *Disengage* as a bonus action.

**Victory Conditions:**
- Renna killed or driven off
- Lead wagons reach the gates

**Rewards:**
- *+1 Longbow* (Renna's weapon)
- Fang's *Collar of the Pack* (allows *Speak with Animals* targeting canines, 1/day)
- Covenant battle plans (useful for Siege of the Grey Keep)

### Social Encounters

#### Calming the Refugees
**Location:** The Ridge (or any point of high tension)

**NPCs Present:** Aldric, Torgun, various refugees

**Stakes:** If the refugees panic, they may scatter, surrender, or turn on each other

**Information Available:** Why they're fleeing, what they left behind, who has useful skills

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 13 | Refugees calm down, follow orders | Refugees remain panicked, -1 to all group checks |
| Intimidation | 15 | Refugees obey out of fear (resentment later) | Refugees see party as another threat |
| Performance | 12 | Distraction/inspiration, +1 morale | Refugees unimpressed, no change |
| Insight | 11 | Identify the most panicked individuals for targeted help | Miss the troublemakers |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Refugees organize themselves, assist with defenses, move faster
- Moderate: Refugees stay together but remain passive and slow
- Worst: Refugees scatter; some may surrender to the riders

#### Renna's Offer
**Location:** Mile 3 (after ridgeline watchers)

**NPCs Present:** Captain Renna Voss (at 60 ft, mounted), refugees watching

**Stakes:** If the refugees believe her, they may want to surrender

**Information Available:** Renna claims the Covenant wants workers, not corpses; she's lying (or doesn't know the army's true plans)

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Insight | 14 | Detect the lie, expose it to refugees | Believe her, or fail to convince refugees |
| Persuasion | 15 | Convince refugees the Keep is safer than surrender | Some refugees consider surrendering |
| Deception | 13 | Bluff Renna into thinking reinforcements are coming | Renna calls the bluff, accelerates attacks |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Party exposes Renna's lie, refugees unite in defiance, morale boost
- Moderate: Uneasy tension, refugees follow but doubt
- Worst: Three refugee families split off to surrender (they will be captured)

### Exploration Challenges

#### The Broken Wheel
**Location:** Mile 2

**Description:** The Hendricks wagon hits a hidden pothole; the front axle snaps. The wagon tips, spilling cargo. The family of five is uninjured but stranded.

**Skills Useful:**
- Carpenter's Tools or Investigation DC 13: Assess the damage
- Athletics DC 14: Lift the wagon for repairs
- Survival DC 12: Find a suitable replacement branch
- Caravan organization (any social skill DC 11): Redistribute passengers quickly

**Hazards:** Every 10 minutes spent stopped risks another worg probe attack

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Quick fix (under 20 minutes): No additional attacks
- Found alternative route (Aldric's suggestion): Can bypass the bridge ambush but risks a stream crossing (group Athletics DC 12)

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Riders are herding, not attacking | Act 1 | Observation, Insight DC 12 | Understanding enemy tactics |
| Torgun is essential for the Keep | Act 2 (Broken Wheel) | Conversation with Torgun | Prioritizing his wagon |
| Renna is lying about surrender | Act 2 (Renna's Offer) | Insight DC 14 | Morale boost for refugees |
| Army is one day behind | Encounter 2 (captured orders) | Searching bodies | Urgency for the Keep |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. A refugee claims to have seen a faster route through the woods (it's actually a dead end where worgs wait)
2. Renna's "white flag" offer seems genuine (it's a trap to separate the party)

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The burning wagon at the start wasn't an accident—the Covenant used alchemical fire to strand the Thornwood family and slow the caravan.

**When It's Revealed:** Mira Thornwood recognizes the chemical residue if she examines the wreckage (or the party investigates with Arcana DC 14).

**Impact:** Confirms the Covenant's ruthlessness; establishes that the enemy has been manipulating events longer than the party knew.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Caltrops | Mile 4 (Bridge approach) | Walking/riding | Difficult terrain, piercing damage | DEX 15 | 1d4 piercing, speed halved |
| Burning Oil | Mile 4 (Roadblock) | Thrown by hobgoblins | 10 ft radius fire | DEX 13 | 2d6 fire |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Panicked Horses | Any combat | Wagons may bolt, crash | Animal Handling DC 14 |
| Muddy Stream | Mile 4 | Difficult terrain, Athletics check to cross | Find the ford (Survival DC 12) |
| Fading Light | After 3 hours | Dim light penalties for non-darkvision races | Torches (but reveal position) |

### Puzzles

#### The Broken Wheel
**Location:** Mile 2

**Description:** The Hendricks wagon has a snapped front axle. The party must decide how to handle this—time versus lives.

**Solution:** Multiple valid approaches:
- Repair with tools (30 minutes, Carpenter's Tools DC 14)
- Repair with magic (*Mending* doesn't work on something this large; *Fabricate* would)
- Redistribute passengers (10 minutes, lose cargo)
- Abandon wagon (immediate, family walks)
- Torgun's help (15 minutes with Carpenter's Tools DC 10)

**Hints:**
- Torgun has the skills but refuses to leave his tools
- A spare axle exists in another wagon (Investigation DC 13 to find)

**Bypass Options:** Simply leave the wagon and family (loses civilians, damages morale)

## Rewards

### Treasure

#### Monetary
**Total Value:** ~150 gp (modest—refugees have little)

**Distribution:**
| Location | Contents | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Grateful refugees | Pooled coins | 35 gp |
| Ambush captain's pouch | Military pay | 50 gp |
| Renna's saddlebags | Covenant coin | 65 gp |

#### Magic Items
| Item | Location | Guarded By |
|------|----------|------------|
| *Potion of Healing* (x3) | Mira Thornwood (gift) | Given freely for saving her family |
| *Cloak of Elvenkind* | Ambush captain | Recovered after Encounter 3 |
| *+1 Longbow* | Captain Renna Voss | Recovered after Boss Encounter |
| *Collar of the Pack* | Fang (dire wolf) | Recovered after Boss Encounter |

### Quest Rewards
**From Quest Giver:** No material reward—Aldric and the refugees have nothing to give.

**Additional Rewards:**
- Torgun will repair any damaged equipment for free at the Keep
- Mira will brew potions at cost during the siege
- The refugees spread word of the party's heroism, providing advantage on Charisma checks with Keep defenders

### Experience
**Combat XP:** ~2,400 XP (varies by encounter outcomes)

**Non-Combat XP:** ~600 XP (social encounters, skill challenges)

**Milestone Advancement:** This is an interlude; no level advancement. Progress toward Level 7 continues.

### Intangible Rewards
- **Reputation:** The party becomes known as protectors of the common folk. Grey Keep defenders respect them.
- **Allies Gained:** Aldric (community leader), Torgun (essential craftsman), Mira (healer/alchemist), grateful refugee families
- **Information Learned:** Covenant army strength, timeline of siege, enemy tactics
- **Story Hooks:** Torgun's knowledge of the portcullis becomes critical in Siege of the Grey Keep; refugee families may appear during the siege

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| The Burning Wagon | Rescue immediately / Scout first / Ignore | Saves Thornwood family (Mira's potions) / Better tactical info / Faster start but lose ally |
| The Broken Wheel | Fix / Redistribute / Abandon | Time cost varies; abandonment loses morale |
| Renna's Offer | Refuse / Negotiate / Attack during parley | Morale effect; attacking may scatter some riders |
| The Ridgeline | Clear it / Ignore it / Split party | Full clear removes flanking threat; ignoring risks ambush; splitting is dangerous |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Not practical with 12 wagons, but a stealth team could eliminate the ridgeline watchers before they report
- **Diplomacy:** Renna won't genuinely negotiate, but buying time through talk is valid
- **Brute Force:** Hunting down all worg riders is possible but leaves the caravan undefended
- **Deception:** Convincing Renna that reinforcements are coming might delay her attacks

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- If the caravan is captured, the party can flee to the Keep alone, but they arrive demoralized
- If most wagons are lost, the survivors still provide some benefit to the Keep
- If Renna escapes, she appears again during the Siege of the Grey Keep as a lieutenant
- Total party capture leads to a prison break scenario (modify Siege of the Grey Keep opening)

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** The gates open to cheering soldiers. The refugees collapse in relief, many weeping. Commander Mara (or the party, if they've taken command) directs the civilians to shelter. Torgun immediately begins examining the damaged portcullis. Soldiers share what little food they have. For one evening, there is hope in the Grey Keep.

**If Failed:** The party arrives alone or with a handful of survivors. Word spreads that the Covenant shows no mercy. Morale plummets. The siege begins with the defenders already believing they will lose.

**If Partial Success:** Some refugees made it; some didn't. The survivors are grateful but haunted. Families ask about missing members. The mood is grim but not hopeless.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- Refugee survivors become part of the Keep's civilian population during the siege
- Torgun repairs the portcullis, which is critical for the defense (if he survived)
- Renna (if alive) reports party tactics to Warlord Kragg
- The party's reputation influences how the Keep's soldiers view them during the siege

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. Renna Voss (if she escaped) has sworn vengeance—she'll appear in a future adventure
2. The three families who surrendered (if any) are now Covenant prisoners—a rescue mission later?
3. Mira Thornwood's knowledge of herbalism hints at deeper alchemical secrets

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Aldric Cartwright | Becomes civilian coordinator at the Keep | Captured or killed; family mourns |
| Torgun Ironhammer | Repairs portcullis, joins defense | Captured (Covenant needs smiths) |
| Mira Thornwood | Provides healing during siege | Lost with her family |
| Captain Renna Voss | Killed or routed; pack scatters | Promoted, leads siege assault |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Keep the clock visible—remind players of the sunset deadline frequently
- Describe the refugees as individuals: a mother clutching a baby, an old man refusing to leave his goat, children crying for home
- Make the worg howls a recurring element—they should feel hunted
- The dilemma isn't fighting; it's fighting *and* protecting. Combat-focused parties must adapt.
- Let the players' choices matter—if they save everyone, celebrate it; if they lose people, make those deaths meaningful

### Pacing Suggestions
- **Hour 1:** The Hook, Burning Wagon, establishing the caravan, first worg attack
- **Hour 2:** Broken Wheel, Ridgeline tension, Renna's offer
- **Hour 3:** The Ambush at Millford Bridge
- **Hour 4:** Final Run, Boss Encounter, Resolution

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to hunt all the riders | Remind them the caravan is undefended; have another pack attack |
| Split the party | Both groups face harder encounters; coordination becomes difficult |
| Abandon the caravan | They reach the Keep easily, but with shame and lost allies |
| Try to negotiate with Renna | She plays along to waste time, then attacks anyway |
| Use flight/teleportation | They can scout ahead or bypass obstacles, but can't move 12 wagons |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Reduce worg numbers in each encounter by 2
- Remove the Ambush captain
- Have Grey Keep scouts arrive during the final encounter to help

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add a **Worg Alpha** (use Winter Wolf stats) to Renna's pack
- Include a **Hobgoblin Devastator** at the ambush
- Give Renna *Legendary Resistance* (1/day)

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- Mention the smoke rising from the direction of the Covenant army—they're close
- Have refugees describe the size of the force chasing them (5,000+)
- Torgun mentions the Keep's defenses are damaged—setting up the Siege
- Renna carries orders referencing "Warlord Kragg" and "the Sunstone"—the Covenant knows what the party has

## Secrets

1. Captain Renna Voss was once a ranger who protected these same villages. The Covenant recruited her by promising revenge against the noble who had her brother executed for poaching. She tells herself she's only following orders.

2. One of the refugee children, a boy named Tam, is actually a Covenant sympathizer—his parents were killed by soldiers during a food riot, and a Covenant agent told him the rebellion would bring justice. He hasn't done anything yet, but he's been noting the party's capabilities.

3. The burning wagon wasn't random—the Covenant specifically targeted the Thornwoods because Mira once healed a Silver Flame inquisitor who was investigating cult activity. This is personal.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. The party has just completed **[[The Forgotten Shrine]]** and is traveling to the Grey Keep with the Sunstone
2. Alternatively, the party is traveling to the Keep for any reason and encounters the caravan by chance

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **The Siege Begins:** Arriving at the Keep leads directly into **[[Siege of the Grey Keep]]**, with refugee allies and Torgun's repairs playing key roles

## Notes
- This adventure emphasizes protection over combat—parties may need to think differently
- The time pressure is the real enemy; combat is a tool the enemy uses to slow the party
- Refugee NPCs should feel like real people worth saving, not faceless obstacles
- Captain Renna Voss is a tragic villain—she's not evil, just broken and manipulated
- This interlude sets emotional stakes for the Siege; the party should care about these people
