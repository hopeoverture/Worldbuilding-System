# The Scout's Report

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A tense tracking adventure following the chaos of the siege. The party must pursue an Invisible Stalker through rugged terrain to recover stolen strategic maps that reveal the Ice Worm's Tunnel—a critical shortcut through the Sundered Peaks. This interlude emphasizes survival skills, clever tactics against an invisible foe, and the consequences of the Covenant's infiltration reaching even into the heart of the Grey Keep's defenses.

## Overview

The Siege of Grey Keep is broken, but victory tastes bitter. In the chaos of the final assault, a Covenant assassin—an **Invisible Stalker** bound to the cult's service—infiltrated the war room and stole the strategic maps detailing routes through [[The Sundered Peaks]]. These maps, compiled by Grey Warden scouts over decades, show the location of the **Ice Worm's Tunnel**, a hidden passage that could allow the party to bypass the dragon Cryonax and reach the Obsidian Gate. Without them, the journey through the mountains becomes a blind march into death. The party must track the invisible creature into the foothills and recover the maps before the Stalker can deliver them to its Covenant masters—or destroy them entirely.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Monster Hunt / Recovery Mission

**Tone:** Tense / Survivalist / Thriller

**Themes:**
- Hunting the unseen
- The cost of war (even victory has consequences)
- Perseverance against impossible odds

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** One-Shot (4-5 hours)

**Party Level:** 7

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate (with potential for Deadly if poorly handled)

**Combat Frequency:** Low (one major encounter, possible minor skirmishes)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Low

**Exploration Emphasis:** High (tracking and survival focus)

## The Hook

### How It Begins
As the smoke clears from the siege, [[Lieutenant Mara]] summons the party to the war room. The door hangs askew, papers scattered across blood-stained flagstones. The heavy iron chest that held the mountain maps lies empty, its lock melted by acid. A trail of dusty footprints—appearing from nowhere—leads out the shattered window and down the wall. Whatever took the maps was never seen by the guards who died defending them.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Lieutenant Mara]]
**Motivation:** The maps represent years of scouting work and the only known safe route through the Sundered Peaks. Without them, the pursuit of the Covenant becomes suicidal.
**What They Offer:** The Grey Keep's gratitude, supplies for the mountain journey, and a 500gp bounty pooled from the surviving officers.

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- Three guards were killed in the war room—throats slit by something they never saw
- The attack happened during the chaos when [[Warlord Kragg]] breached the gate
- The creature left footprints in the dust and blood, but no one saw its form
- A scout spotted the prints continuing west into the foothills before losing the trail
- Whatever took the maps moves fast but seems to leave a faint trace in loose material

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Critical

**Consequences of Delay:** Every hour that passes allows the Stalker to put more distance between itself and the Keep. Worse, the creature may have orders to destroy the maps if capture seems imminent. If the party delays more than 12 hours, the Stalker reaches a Covenant cell and the maps are copied and distributed—making their recovery meaningless.

## Background

### The Situation
The Invisible Stalker was summoned months ago by a Covenant mage and bound with a single command: observe the Grey Keep until ordered otherwise, then steal the mountain maps and deliver them to a handler waiting in the Thornback Canyon, three days west. The creature has no will of its own—it is an elemental of pure air, bound to servitude. It cannot be reasoned with, bribed, or intimidated. It will complete its mission or be destroyed trying. The Stalker's greatest advantage is its invisibility, but it is not immune to detection—it disturbs dust, leaves prints in soft earth, and creates a faint shimmer when moving through rain or mist.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- Six months ago, a Covenant agent in [[Highwall]] purchased information about Grey Warden scouting operations
- A summoner in [[The Citadel of Tears]] bound an Invisible Stalker and sent it to observe the Grey Keep
- The creature waited patiently, incorporeal and unseen, until the siege created the perfect opportunity
- During Kragg's final assault, it struck—killing the guards and escaping in the confusion
- The Stalker now travels toward Thornback Canyon, where a Covenant courier awaits

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Lieutenant Mara]] | Recover the maps | Send the party to hunt the Stalker |
| The Invisible Stalker | Deliver maps to handler | Stealth, speed, and violence if cornered |
| Covenant Courier | Receive the maps | Wait in Thornback Canyon with escape route planned |
| The Party | Track and kill the Stalker | Survival skills, clever tactics, combat |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** They recover the maps showing the Ice Worm's Tunnel, providing a critical shortcut through the Sundered Peaks that bypasses both the deadliest terrain and potentially the dragon Cryonax's hunting grounds.

**If the party fails:** The journey through [[The Sundered Peaks]] becomes a blind gamble. The party must either find another route (adding weeks to their journey), face Cryonax directly, or attempt the High Pass during storm season (almost certain death). Additionally, the Covenant gains detailed intelligence about Grey Warden operations throughout the region.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Track the Invisible Stalker, destroy it, and recover the Satchel of Maps intact.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Capture or kill the Covenant courier waiting at Thornback Canyon
2. Recover the bodies of the slain guards for proper burial
3. Discover how the Covenant knew about the maps (intelligence lead)

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. The Stalker carries a Covenant communication token that could be used to intercept future messages
2. The courier knows the location of a Covenant waystation in the Sundered Peaks

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The Invisible Stalker is destroyed
- The Satchel of Maps is recovered with contents intact
- The party returns to Grey Keep within 48 hours

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- The Stalker escapes with the maps (delivers to courier)
- The Stalker destroys the maps (if cornered with no escape)
- The party is killed or incapacitated during the hunt
- More than 48 hours pass (Covenant copies and distributes the intelligence)

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: Setup
**Goal:** Establish the theft, gather information, and begin the pursuit.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The War Room:** The party examines the crime scene. Investigation (DC 13) reveals acid burns on the lock (Stalker used its elemental nature), the footprints' spacing suggests a humanoid running, and a faint smell of ozone lingers. The trail leads out the window and down the keep's west wall.
2. **The Witness:** A wounded guard saw "something" shimmer near the stairs—like heat haze on summer stones. He heard breathing but saw nothing before his companion fell.
3. **The Trail Begins:** Outside the keep, a ranger or tracker can find where the creature entered the brush. The pursuit begins.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The creature is invisible but not intangible
- It disturbs its environment (dust, leaves, loose stone)
- It's moving fast but not teleporting—it can be caught

**Transition to Act 2:** The party follows the trail into the rocky foothills west of Grey Keep, where the terrain becomes more difficult and the Stalker's advantages grow.

### Act 2: Confrontation
**Goal:** Track the Stalker through challenging terrain, survive its ambush attempts, and corner it.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Dry Riverbed:** The Stalker's trail crosses a rocky streambed where tracks vanish. Successful Survival checks (DC 15) find where it exited—or the party must split up and search, becoming vulnerable.
2. **The Ambush Point:** The Stalker realizes it's being followed and sets an ambush at a narrow ravine. It attacks from above with hit-and-run tactics, trying to wound and discourage pursuers rather than fight to the death.
3. **The Dust Storm:** An afternoon windstorm provides both challenge and opportunity—visibility drops, but the Stalker becomes partially visible as dust outlines its form. A key opportunity for confrontation.

**Rising Tension:** As the party closes in, they find signs of the Stalker's passage: a dead mountain goat killed by invisible claws, torn clothing from a trapper who stumbled across it (the trapper survived by fleeing).

**Midpoint Twist:** The party discovers they're not the only hunters. A pair of Covenant scouts are following the same trail, planning to escort the Stalker the rest of the way. The party can ambush the scouts (gaining information about the rendezvous point) or avoid them (but risk being attacked from behind later).

**Transition to Act 3:** The trail leads into Thornback Canyon—a narrow, wind-scoured gorge where the Stalker's handler waits. The creature is close; its footprints in the sand are fresh.

### Act 3: Resolution
**Goal:** Confront the Stalker in Thornback Canyon, defeat it, and recover the maps.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Canyon Approach:** The party enters Thornback Canyon—sheer walls, howling wind, and poor visibility. The constant wind gives the Stalker disadvantage on Stealth (the wind patterns reveal its location), but also imposes disadvantage on hearing-based Perception checks.
2. **The Courier's Camp:** A small camp sits at the canyon's far end—a single tent, a saddled horse, and a cloaked figure waiting. The Stalker is nearly there. The party must intercept it before it reaches the courier.

**Climactic Encounter:** The party confronts the Stalker in the canyon. The creature fights to complete its mission, attempting to reach the courier or, failing that, to destroy the satchel rather than let it be recaptured. The courier will flee on horseback if combat begins, but may be stopped by quick action.

**Resolution Options:**
- **Complete Victory:** Stalker destroyed, maps recovered intact, courier captured/killed
- **Partial Success:** Stalker destroyed but maps damaged (some routes lost), or courier escapes with information
- **Pyrrhic Victory:** Maps recovered but party severely wounded, or courier killed but satchel partially burned
- **Failure:** Stalker escapes to courier, or maps destroyed

## Locations

### Overview Map
The hunt covers roughly 25 miles of increasingly rugged terrain, from the Grey Keep's western walls through rocky foothills into Thornback Canyon. The terrain transitions from sparse grassland to scrubland to bare rock and sand.

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[Grey Keep]]

**Description:** A weathered stone fortress built into the mountainside, still smoking from the siege. The war room sits in the keep's upper level, its window facing west toward the mountains.

**Key Features:**
- Shattered window (escape route)
- Blood-stained flagstones (three guards died here)
- Empty iron chest (maps were stored here)
- Acid-burned lock (evidence of the Stalker)

**Encounters Here:** Investigation only; no combat

### Location 2: The Foothills
**Description:** Rocky, scrub-covered terrain rising toward the Sundered Peaks. Game trails wind between boulders; dry riverbeds cut through the landscape. Sparse vegetation offers little concealment for either hunter or prey.

**Key Features:**
- Dry riverbed (tracking challenge)
- Narrow ravines (ambush terrain)
- Exposed ridgelines (long sightlines)
- Seasonal dust storms (visibility hazard/opportunity)

**Encounters Here:** Ambush by Invisible Stalker; possible encounter with Covenant scouts

### Location 3: Thornback Canyon
**Description:** A narrow gorge carved by ancient floods, named for the thorn-bushes that cling to its walls. Constant wind howls through the passage, making communication difficult but revealing invisible movement through disturbed dust and sand. The canyon floor is soft sand over stone—perfect for tracking.

**Key Features:**
- 60-foot sheer walls (no easy escape)
- Constant strong wind (disadvantage on Stealth for Stalker; disadvantage on hearing Perception for all)
- Sandy floor (tracks visible)
- Thorny brush along walls (difficult terrain, provides cover)

**Encounters Here:** Final confrontation with Invisible Stalker; possible combat with Covenant courier

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Grey Keep | Dry Riverbed | 8 miles | Rocky terrain, heat exhaustion |
| Dry Riverbed | Ambush Ravine | 10 miles | Stalker ambush, loose scree |
| Ambush Ravine | Thornback Canyon | 7 miles | Dust storms, Covenant scouts |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### Lieutenant Mara
**Role:** Quest giver and military liaison

**Description:** A weathered human woman in her forties, [[Lieutenant Mara]] has commanded the Grey Keep's scouts for fifteen years. She has a scar across her throat from a previous encounter with Covenant assassins—she survived, barely.

**Personality:** Direct, practical, and unflappable. The siege tested her limits, and losing the maps feels like a personal failure.

**What They Want:** Recovery of the maps; vengeance for her slain guards

**What They Know:** The maps detail three passes through the Sundered Peaks, including the Ice Worm's Tunnel discovered by a scout named Harren twelve years ago. Harren didn't survive to return, but his notes did.

**How They Can Help:** Provides tracking supplies, information about the terrain, and a squad of soldiers to guard the Keep while the party pursues.

### Neutrals

#### Torvin the Trapper
**Role:** Witness and potential guide

**Description:** A grizzled mountain man who encountered "something invisible" while checking his trap lines. Scraped and terrified, he fled to the nearest farm and refuses to return to the foothills.

**Personality:** Superstitious, cowardly but knowledgeable about the terrain

**What They Want:** To be left alone and never see the "wind demon" again

**Attitude Toward Party:** Terrified but cooperative if the party offers protection or payment. He knows the foothills intimately and can describe Thornback Canyon's layout.

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: The Invisible Stalker
**Role:** The enemy—a bound elemental assassin

**Description:** The Stalker has no true form, being a creature of pure air and malevolence. When dust or rain reveals its outline, it appears as a vaguely humanoid shape roughly seven feet tall, with elongated limbs and no discernible features. It carries the Satchel of Maps in one clawed appendage—the only visible part of its cargo. The creature does not speak, negotiate, or hesitate. It was bound with a simple command and will complete its mission or be destroyed.

**Personality:** None—it is an elemental bound to service, not a thinking creature

**Motivation:** Complete its binding: deliver the maps to the Covenant courier

**Methods:** Stealth, ambush, hit-and-run attacks, and—if cornered—fighting to the death while attempting to destroy the maps

**Weakness:** The Stalker is invisible but not intangible. It can be tracked by its effects on the environment. In dusty or sandy conditions, it becomes partially visible. Wind reveals its passage. See Invisibility, Faerie Fire, or similar effects negate its primary advantage entirely.

**Combat Notes:** Invisible Stalker (CR 6). Attacks with advantage due to invisibility; takes half damage from nonmagical weapons. Will attempt to flee if reduced to half HP unless cornered. If escape is impossible and defeat is certain, it will spend its final actions destroying the satchel (fire, acid, or tearing it apart).

#### Secondary Antagonist: Covenant Courier
**Role:** Handler waiting to receive the maps

**Description:** A lean, hooded figure named Selas—a human in Covenant service who specializes in intelligence work. He has waited three days in Thornback Canyon, growing increasingly paranoid that something has gone wrong.

**Connection to Primary:** Selas summoned the Stalker six months ago using a scroll provided by the Covenant. The creature is bound to deliver its prize to him specifically.

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Ravine Ambush
**Location:** A narrow ravine in the foothills, 18 miles from Grey Keep

**Trigger:** The party enters the ravine while following the Stalker's trail

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Invisible Stalker | 1 | Hit-and-run tactics; attacks from above |

**Tactics:** The Stalker attacks from a ledge 20 feet up, targeting the party's tracker or spellcaster. It strikes once or twice, then retreats deeper into the ravine, hoping to discourage pursuit. This is a probe, not a serious engagement—it's testing the party's capabilities.

**Difficulty:** Medium (not meant to be lethal; the Stalker flees after 2-3 rounds)

**Terrain Features:**
- Narrow floor (10 feet wide; difficult to spread out)
- Ledges at 15-20 feet (the Stalker uses these for ambush)
- Loose scree (difficult terrain in places)
- Limited visibility around bends

**Rewards:** None if the Stalker escapes; if wounded significantly (20+ damage), it drops a Covenant token that could be used to identify other agents.

#### Encounter 2: Covenant Scouts
**Location:** The dusty hills between the ravine and Thornback Canyon

**Trigger:** Party approaches the scouts' observation point; alternatively, the scouts ambush the party

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Covenant Scout (Spy stats) | 2 | One archer, one infiltrator |

**Tactics:** If aware of the party, they set an ambush using the terrain. If surprised, one attempts to flee to warn the courier while the other delays. They fight to kill but will surrender if clearly outmatched.

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Rewards:** Information about the courier's location; Covenant communication tokens worth 50gp to the right buyer; composite shortbow and 20 arrows; 35gp in mixed coins.

#### Boss Encounter: Thornback Canyon Showdown
**Location:** Thornback Canyon, near the courier's camp

**Setup:** The party must intercept the Stalker before it reaches the courier, approximately 200 feet away. The wind howls, sand swirls, and the Stalker is visible as a dust-shrouded humanoid shape. The courier sees the confrontation and must decide whether to help or flee.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Invisible Stalker | 1 | Fighting to complete mission; partially visible due to dust |
| Covenant Courier (Spy stats) | 1 | Will flee on horseback if combat turns against Stalker |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 (Stalker at full HP):** The Stalker fights aggressively, trying to break through the party line to reach the courier. Uses its superior speed (50 ft fly) to maneuver around the party if possible.
2. **Phase 2 (Stalker below half HP):** Recognizing that escape to the courier is impossible, the Stalker switches to destroying the maps. It will spend actions burning or tearing the satchel while defending itself. If reduced to 20 HP or less, it attempts one final attack against whoever is nearest to the satchel.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:** None, but the strong wind grants disadvantage on ranged attacks and disadvantage on hearing-based Perception checks. The sandy floor makes the Stalker easier to track (no Stealth advantage from invisibility).

**Victory Conditions:**
- Stalker destroyed before it can damage the satchel = Complete Victory
- Stalker destroyed but satchel damaged = Partial Victory
- Courier captured or killed = Bonus objective
- Stalker escapes or destroys satchel = Failure

**Rewards:**
- Satchel of Maps (quest objective)
- Courier's spellbook (if captured/killed): contains notes on summoning, worth 200gp
- Covenant communication token
- Riding horse with tack
- 75gp in mixed coins

### Social Encounters

#### The Trapper's Tale
**Location:** A farmhouse 5 miles from Grey Keep

**NPCs Present:** Torvin the Trapper; the farmer's family (background)

**Stakes:** Information about the Stalker's route and Thornback Canyon

**Information Available:**
- Torvin saw the "wind demon" three hours ago, moving fast toward the canyon
- He knows Thornback Canyon well—hunts there regularly
- The canyon has one entrance; sheer walls make climbing difficult
- A "strange fellow" has been camped at the canyon's far end for days

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 12 | Torvin shares all he knows and offers to guide them to the canyon entrance | Only basic information |
| Intimidation | 14 | Torvin shares everything immediately but resents the party | Information, but Torvin may give false directions out of spite |
| Insight | 13 | Recognize Torvin genuinely believes in the "demon"—he's not exaggerating | May dismiss his account as superstition |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Torvin guides the party to Thornback Canyon, saving an hour of travel
- Moderate: Torvin provides accurate directions and description of the terrain
- Worst: Torvin's directions are vague or deliberately misleading, costing time

### Exploration Challenges

#### Tracking the Invisible
**Location:** The foothills between Grey Keep and Thornback Canyon

**Description:** Following the Stalker requires careful attention to environmental disturbances—bent grass, disturbed dust, the faint impressions of invisible feet in soft earth. The trail is difficult but not impossible for a skilled tracker.

**Skills Useful:**
- Survival (primary tracking)
- Investigation (examining clues)
- Perception (spotting distant signs)
- Nature (understanding the creature's behavior)

**Hazards:**
- Losing the trail at the dry riverbed costs 1-2 hours
- The dust storm reduces visibility to 30 feet for 1 hour
- Heat exhaustion (DC 12 Constitution saves every 4 hours without rest)

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Finding the dead mountain goat reveals the Stalker is tiring—it stopped to feed (it didn't, but the party may believe it)
- Discovering the Covenant scouts' trail before they ambush
- Locating a hidden spring for rest and water recovery

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Footprints in dust | War room | Investigation | Confirms invisible creature, not teleportation |
| Acid-burned lock | War room | Perception | Identifies elemental nature (Stalker can produce acid) |
| Shimmer description | Wounded guard | Interview | Confirms Stalker can be partially seen in right conditions |
| Fresh tracks in sand | Dry riverbed | Survival | Confirms party is gaining ground |
| Dead goat | Foothills | Perception/Investigation | Shows Stalker passed this way recently |
| "Strange fellow" camp | Torvin | Social | Identifies courier/rendezvous point |
| Scout communications | Covenant scouts | Interrogation/Search | Details of the courier and Stalker's mission |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. A second set of tracks in the foothills belongs to Torvin fleeing—not a second creature
2. The Covenant scouts may suggest there are reinforcements coming; there aren't (they were lying to seem more dangerous)

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The Stalker is not simply stealing the maps—it has been observing the Grey Keep for months. If the party examines the Covenant scout's notes or interrogates the courier, they learn that the Stalker reported on troop movements, defensive weaknesses, and supply schedules. The siege was planned using intelligence gathered by this creature.

**When It's Revealed:** During interrogation of scouts or courier, or when examining captured documents.

**Impact:** The party realizes the Covenant's infiltration runs deeper than they thought. The Grey Keep's defenses may still be compromised by information already sent. Lieutenant Mara will need to know.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Stalker's Ambush | Ravine | Movement | Stalker attacks from concealment | Perception DC 18 to spot | See combat encounter |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Heat Exhaustion | Foothills | DC 12 Con save every 4 hours or gain exhaustion level | Rest, water, shade |
| Dust Storm | Foothills | Visibility reduced to 30 ft; disadvantage on Perception | Wait it out or use it to spot the Stalker |
| Loose Scree | Ravine | DC 12 Dexterity save or fall prone; difficult terrain | Move carefully (half speed) |
| Strong Winds | Thornback Canyon | Disadvantage on ranged attacks and hearing-based Perception | No mitigation; accept conditions |

### Puzzles

#### Following the Invisible
**Location:** Throughout the hunt

**Description:** The Stalker is invisible, but tracking it requires creative thinking. The party must identify what signs an invisible creature leaves behind.

**Solution:**
- Footprints in soft earth, sand, and dust
- Disturbed vegetation (bent grass, moved leaves)
- The faint smell of ozone
- Wind patterns that flow around "nothing"
- Reactions of animals that can sense but not see it

**Hints:**
- The wounded guard mentions the creature "smelled like lightning"
- Torvin saw grass bending where nothing walked
- In the dust storm, the creature's outline becomes visible

**Bypass Options:** A ranger with Primeval Awareness can sense the creature's direction; spellcasters with detect magic sense the binding magic on it; speak with animals reveals terrified reports from local wildlife.

## Rewards

### Treasure

#### Monetary
**Total Value:** ~160gp

**Distribution:**
| Location | Contents | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Covenant Scouts | Mixed coins | 35gp |
| Courier's camp | Mixed coins, small gems | 75gp |
| Quest reward from Mara | Bounty | 500gp (split by party) |

#### Magic Items
| Item | Location | Guarded By |
|------|----------|------------|
| Potion of See Invisibility | Courier's saddlebags | None (if courier flees, he takes it) |
| Scroll of Invisibility | Courier's spellbook | Courier |

### Quest Rewards
**From Quest Giver:** 500gp bounty, supplies for the mountain journey (10 days rations, cold weather gear, climbing equipment), and a letter of recommendation to any Grey Warden outpost.

**Additional Rewards:** If the party captures the courier alive, Lieutenant Mara offers an additional 200gp bounty for the intelligence he provides.

### Experience
**Combat XP:**
- Invisible Stalker (CR 6): 2,300 XP
- Covenant Scouts (CR 1 each): 400 XP
- Courier (CR 1): 200 XP
- **Total Possible:** 2,900 XP

**Non-Combat XP:**
- Successfully tracking the Stalker: 500 XP
- Gathering intelligence from Torvin: 100 XP
- Discovering the Covenant's infiltration: 300 XP
- **Total Possible:** 900 XP

**Milestone Advancement:** This interlude does not grant a level; milestone advancement occurs after completing [[Into the Sundered Peaks]].

### Intangible Rewards
- **Reputation:** The party gains renown among the [[Grey Wardens]] as capable monster hunters
- **Allies Gained:** Lieutenant Mara becomes a reliable contact who can provide support in the Borderlands
- **Information Learned:** The maps reveal the Ice Worm's Tunnel, making [[Into the Sundered Peaks]] survivable; the intelligence about Covenant infiltration proves valuable
- **Story Hooks:** The Covenant's network extends further than expected; who else is watching?

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Approach to ambush | Charge through / Set own ambush / Find alternate route | Affects damage taken and Stalker's escape likelihood |
| Covenant scouts | Ambush / Avoid / Parley | Affects information gained and whether they warn the courier |
| Cornered Stalker | All-out attack / Negotiate with courier for surrender | Stalker cannot surrender, but courier might turn on it for survival |
| Courier fate | Capture / Kill / Let flee | Affects intelligence gained and future Covenant knowledge |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** The party could attempt to reach Thornback Canyon before the Stalker, setting an ambush rather than pursuing
- **Diplomacy:** Not possible with the Stalker (it's bound and cannot negotiate), but the courier might surrender if clearly outmatched
- **Brute Force:** Simply chasing and fighting; effective but may damage the maps
- **Deception:** The party could use disguise or illusion to impersonate Covenant agents, potentially confusing the courier

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- If the maps are destroyed, Lieutenant Mara provides partial information from memory—enough to attempt [[Into the Sundered Peaks]] at increased difficulty
- If the party is badly wounded, they may need to retreat and let the Stalker escape, accepting the consequences
- If the Stalker delivers the maps, the party learns this and must assume the Covenant knows their route—they need a new plan

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** The party returns to Grey Keep as heroes. Lieutenant Mara studies the maps and provides a briefing on the Ice Worm's Tunnel—a hidden passage that should allow the party to bypass the worst of the mountain dangers. The journey to the Obsidian Gate suddenly seems possible.

**If Failed:** The party returns empty-handed. Mara's scouts attempt to reconstruct the routes from memory, but the Ice Worm's Tunnel remains unknown. The party must either take the High Pass (deadly) or attempt to find the tunnel through trial and error (time-consuming and dangerous).

**If Partial Success:** The maps are recovered but damaged. Some routes are lost. The party knows the Ice Worm's Tunnel exists but the exact entrance location is unclear—they'll need to search the glacier field when they arrive.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- The revelation of Covenant surveillance methods alerts the Grey Wardens to check for other infiltrators
- If the courier escapes, the Covenant knows the party is hunting them specifically
- Lieutenant Mara begins developing countermeasures against invisible threats

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. Who in the Covenant's network sold information about the Grey Warden maps?
2. The summoner who bound the Stalker is still active at the Citadel of Tears
3. How many other Stalkers has the Covenant bound for surveillance?

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Lieutenant Mara | Promoted to acting commander of Grey Keep | Demoted for losing critical intelligence |
| Torvin the Trapper | Returns to his trap lines, grateful to the "demon hunters" | Abandons the foothills entirely, too frightened to return |
| Covenant Courier | Captured/killed, or flees to report failure | Successfully receives maps, promoted within Covenant |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- **Build tension through environment:** The dust storm, the empty landscape, the knowledge that something invisible is out there—lean into the paranoia
- **Let players get creative:** Tracking an invisible creature should feel like a puzzle, not just skill checks
- **The Stalker is smart but limited:** It's bound to a simple command; it won't innovate beyond hit-and-run tactics
- **Maps as MacGuffin:** Emphasize that these maps are the only way the party knows to safely cross the mountains; without them, the next adventure becomes much harder

### Pacing Suggestions
- **Act 1 (Investigation):** 30-45 minutes; establish urgency, gather information
- **Act 2 (Pursuit):** 60-90 minutes; build tension through tracking, environmental challenges, and the ambush
- **Act 3 (Confrontation):** 45-60 minutes; climactic battle, resolution

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to cast See Invisibility early | Let them—it's a resource well spent; the Stalker will avoid areas where it knows it can be seen |
| Want to set an ambush instead of pursuing | Allow it; they can reach Thornback Canyon first if they're clever |
| Capture the courier for interrogation | He knows about the Citadel of Tears, the summoner who bound the Stalker, and the Covenant's general operations |
| Try to negotiate with the Stalker | It cannot respond—it's bound to silence and single-minded purpose |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Remove the Covenant scouts encounter
- Reduce the Stalker's HP by 20
- Have the courier flee immediately rather than fighting
- Provide a Potion of See Invisibility at Torvin's farmhouse

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add a second Invisible Stalker (bound together, working in tandem)
- The courier is a higher-level mage (use Mage stats instead of Spy)
- The Stalker fights more aggressively, using its flight speed to full advantage
- Add environmental complications (rockslide, second dust storm during the final battle)

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- The Ice Worm's Tunnel mentioned in the maps sets up [[The Ice Worms Tunnel]]
- The dragon Cryonax is marked on the maps with a warning symbol
- References to the Obsidian Gate foreshadow the campaign's direction
- The Covenant's infiltration methods hint at their reach within other organizations

## Secrets

1. **The Long Watch:** The Invisible Stalker has been observing Grey Keep for six months. Everything about the siege—the timing, the assault routes, the weaknesses exploited—came from intelligence this creature gathered. The Covenant knew exactly when and where to strike.

2. **The Binding Flaw:** The Stalker was bound by a mid-level summoner using a scroll beyond their full understanding. If the binding is disrupted (by dispel magic at 5th level or higher targeting the creature during combat), the Stalker is freed—it will immediately attempt to kill its summoner, abandoning its mission. This information could be learned from the courier if captured.

3. **Selas's Doubt:** The Covenant courier, Selas, has been having second thoughts about the cause. He's seen too much cruelty and questions whether the Shackled God's liberation will truly bring enlightenment. If approached carefully and offered protection, he might defect—though his soul-mark means the Covenant will eventually find him.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. The party participated in [[Siege of the Grey Keep]] and is the logical choice for pursuit
2. Lieutenant Mara specifically requests the party based on their demonstrated capabilities
3. The party has a personal stake—perhaps one of the slain guards was someone they knew

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **The Infiltrator Network:** Who else has the Covenant been watching? The Grey Keep isn't the only target
2. **The Summoner's Identity:** The mage who bound the Stalker operates from the Citadel of Tears; they could be a future target
3. **Selas's Information:** If captured, the courier provides leads on Covenant operations throughout the Sundered Peaks
4. **The Ice Worm's Tunnel:** The recovered maps reveal the next step—[[The Ice Worms Tunnel]] adventure

A rocky canyon at midday. Swirling dust storm partially revealing a seven-foot humanoid shape—the outline of an Invisible Stalker holding a leather satchel.

**Prompt:**
Thornback Canyon showdown. Narrow gorge with sheer rock walls, thorny brush clinging to stone. A dust-outlined Invisible Stalker—elongated limbs and no face—clutching a leather satchel while fighting desperately. A wizard casting Faerie Fire, purple-pink flames revealing the creature's true form. A fighter lunging with a glowing longsword. A hooded figure (the courier) mounted on a horse, fleeing toward the canyon exit. Sand swirling in the wind. Setting sun casting long orange shadows.

## Notes
- This adventure serves as a breather between the intensity of [[Siege of the Grey Keep]] and the deadly challenge of [[Into the Sundered Peaks]]
- The hunt emphasizes the party's skills outside of direct combat—tracking, planning, and creative problem-solving
- The Invisible Stalker is CR 6; for a level 7 party of 4, this is a manageable but dangerous solo enemy
- If the party is clever about preparation (See Invisibility, Faerie Fire, etc.), the encounter becomes much easier—reward smart play
- The recovered maps are essential for [[The Ice Worms Tunnel]]; without them, that adventure becomes significantly harder
