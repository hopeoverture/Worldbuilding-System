> A post-siege cleanup mission.

## Overview
The Siege is broken, but a Covenant assassin—an **Invisible Stalker**—stole the strategic maps of the **Sundered Peaks** before fleeing. The party must track the creature into the foothills and recover the maps, or they will cover the mountains blind.

## Classification
**Adventure Type:** Hunt
**Tone:** Tense

## The Hook
The war room has been ransacked. Footprints appear in the dust, leading out the window, but no one was seen.

## Objectives
### Primary Objective
Kill the Stalker and retrieve the Satchel of Maps.

## Structure
### Act 1: The Trail
Tracking an invisible foe. Survival checks vs Stealth.

### Act 2: The Lair
The Stalker hides in a windy canyon (disadvantage on hearing).

## Rewards
- **The Maps:** Reveal the location of the **Ice Worm's Tunnel** (Shortcut for Adventure 8).

## Image Prompts
**Prompt:**
**A rocky canyon. Dust swirling in the wind, outlining a humanoid shape. Adventurers back-to-back, looking for the invisible threat. Tension. Hyper-realistic.**

## Connections
- **Connects to:** [[Siege of the Grey Keep]] (Aftermath) -> [[Into the Sundered Peaks]] (Prep)
