# The Silent Bell

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
The bells of the **Temple of the Lawgiver** have fallen silent in [[Oakhaven]], and the village grows uneasy beneath an oppressive quiet. Father Thomas, once a stern but fair shepherd of his flock, now preaches a disturbing new doctrine about "embracing the quiet dark." Unbeknownst to the villagers, the beloved priest has been murdered and replaced by a **Faceless Stalker**—a shapeshifting infiltrator serving the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]. The adventurers must investigate the temple, gather evidence without alerting the imposter, and ultimately purge the defilement before the village falls under the cult's insidious influence.

## Classification

- Light versus shadow, truth versus deception

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 2-3 Sessions

**Party Level:** 2

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate (High social/puzzle difficulty, moderate combat)

**Combat Frequency:** Low (2-3 encounters total, but high stakes)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** High

**Exploration Emphasis:** Moderate

## The Hook

### How It Begins
While celebrating a previous victory at the **Sleeping Giant Tavern** (or arriving fresh in town), the party notices an unsettling silence at sunset—the temple bells that have rung faithfully for generations remain mute. Unrest ripples through the common room as villagers whisper that the gods have abandoned them. Later that evening, a terrified young woman in acolyte robes approaches the party in secret, her hands trembling around a simple wooden holy symbol.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Sister Elara]]
**Motivation:** She fears for her mentor's soul and the sanctity of the temple. Father Thomas taught her everything, and the man wearing his face is a blasphemous mockery of his memory.
**What They Offer:** Access to the temple's side entrance via her key, information about the temple layout and Father Thomas's routines, and healing support if needed. If she survives, she promises access to the temple vault's modest funds as compensation.

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- Father Thomas has always been strict and precise in his worship; now he is lethargic, distracted, and speaks of "new revelations" about embracing darkness
- He has locked the crypts beneath the temple, claiming "necessary renovations" are underway
- The communion wine tastes strange—sweeter, with a bitter aftertaste
- Sister Elara's most disturbing observation: "Father Thomas has no reflection in the holy water font. I saw it with my own eyes."
- If the party possesses the "Shard of Shadow" from a previous adventure, it vibrates faintly when near the temple

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate

**Consequences of Delay:** The Stalker is performing a three-day ritual to fully desecrate the altar. The ritual is currently 70% complete. If the party delays more than one day, the ritual will finish, permanently cutting Oakhaven off from divine magic and making the village vulnerable to further cult infiltration.

## Background

### The Situation
The [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]], a sinister cult that worships forgotten entities of shadow and seeks to "unveil" the world's hidden darkness, sent one of their elite infiltrators to Oakhaven. The **Faceless Stalker** posed as a traveling pilgrim seeking shelter at the temple rectory, learning Father Thomas's mannerisms and speech patterns over three days before striking. The creature murdered the elderly priest in his sleep, stuffed his body in the temple crypts, and seamlessly assumed his identity. Now it works methodically to corrupt the temple: tainting the communion wine with Dream-Lily extract to make villagers docile and suggestible, preaching subtle heresies about "accepting the peaceful dark," and performing nightly desecration rituals at the altar. The cult views Oakhaven as a strategic foothold—a quiet village where the faithful can be slowly converted before anyone notices.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- **One Week Ago:** A "traveling pilgrim" named Brother Mathis (the Stalker in disguise) arrived seeking shelter. Father Thomas, charitable as always, offered him a room in the rectory.
- **Four Days Ago:** The Stalker completed its study of Thomas's personality and murdered him at midnight, hiding the body in a sealed crypt.
- **Three Days Ago:** The "new" Father Thomas emerged, claiming the pilgrim had departed at dawn. He began subtly altering his sermons.
- **Two Days Ago:** The Stalker began adding Dream-Lily extract to the communion wine and started the desecration ritual.
- **Yesterday:** The bells stopped ringing. The Stalker claimed they needed "repairs" but actually cut the ropes.
- **Now:** The ritual is 70% complete. Villagers grow listless and compliant. Sister Elara, who has been fasting and avoided the tainted wine, remains clear-headed enough to notice the wrongness.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Faceless Stalker]] (as "Father Thomas") | Corrupt the temple for the Covenant | Poison wine, suppress worship, complete desecration ritual |
| [[Sister Elara]] | Protect the faith and honor her mentor | Seek outside help, provide information, spy on the imposter |
| [[Innkeeper Bess]] | Keep the peace (Charmed) | Defend "Father Thomas" from accusations, discourage investigation |
| [[Mayor Aldric Thornwood]] | Maintain order in his village | Initially skeptical of accusations, but can be convinced with evidence |
| [[The Silver Mask]] (Remote) | Expand cult influence into Westmark | Sent the Stalker; awaits reports on progress |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** The temple is reconsecrated, Oakhaven is saved from cult influence, Sister Elara can rebuild the congregation, and the party gains valuable intelligence about the Covenant's activities in the region.

**If the party fails:** The altar's desecration becomes permanent, Oakhaven loses divine protection, villagers become cult thralls over the following weeks, and the Stalker escapes to report the party's identities to the Covenant—making them marked targets.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Expose and defeat the Faceless Stalker impersonating Father Thomas, preventing the corruption of the Temple of the Lawgiver.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Find the body of the real Father Thomas in the crypts (provides closure for Sister Elara and concrete evidence of murder)
2. Purify the defiled altar using a cleansing ritual (prevents any lasting corruption)
3. Cure the charmed villagers by destroying the tainted wine supply
4. Secure the Letter from the Silver Mask (reveals cult plans and hooks to future adventures)

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. The spirit of Father Thomas lingers near his body—putting him to rest properly grants his blessing (Inspiration for one party member)
2. The temple vault contains a minor holy relic that could be useful against shadow creatures

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The Faceless Stalker is slain or permanently driven off
- The altar is reconsecrated (requires a Cleric/Paladin casting *Ceremony*, or a 10-minute ritual using holy water and prayer with a DC 12 Religion check)
- The villagers are freed from the Dream-Lily's influence (happens automatically within 24 hours once the tainted wine is destroyed)

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- The Stalker completes the desecration ritual (if party delays more than one full day)
- The Stalker escapes to warn the Covenant about the party
- The party kills innocent villagers during the charmed mob encounter (moral failure, reputation destroyed)
- The party is driven out of town by a riot incited by the Stalker

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Investigation
**Goal:** Gather evidence of the imposter without alerting the Stalker to suspicion.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Disturbing Sermon:** The party attends an evening service where "Thomas" preaches about "The Peace of the Grave" and "accepting the embrace of the quiet dark." Observant characters (DC 12 Insight) notice his smile is too wide, his movements slightly wrong. He never blinks.
2. **Tavern Whispers:** Conversations with villagers reveal their increasing drowsiness and acceptance. Innkeeper Bess aggressively defends Father Thomas—too aggressively. A DC 14 Insight check reveals she seems almost drugged.
3. **The Rectory Search:** Breaking into Father Thomas's quarters reveals his journal (entries stop abruptly mid-sentence), empty poison vials hidden in a drawer, and most damningly—his silver holy symbol discarded in a wastebin (the Stalker cannot touch it without pain).
4. **The Wine Cellar:** The cellar beneath the temple contains barrels of communion wine. A DC 13 Medicine or Nature check identifies Dream-Lily extract—a narcotic sedative that makes victims suggestible.

**Information to Reveal:**
- Father Thomas's holy symbol causes pain to shapeshifters and fiends
- The wine is tainted with Dream-Lily, explaining villager compliance
- The crypts have been sealed with a new lock the acolytes don't recognize
- Sister Elara saw "Thomas" entering the crypts at midnight, chanting in an unknown language

**Transition to Act 2:** The party either confronts "Thomas" directly, is caught snooping in the rectory, or decides to spring a trap using evidence like the holy symbol.

### Act 2: The Unveiling
**Goal:** Force the creature to reveal its true nature.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Confrontation:** Whether public accusation in the temple or private cornering in the rectory, the party challenges "Thomas." He initially maintains composure, expressing hurt and confusion. "My children, has your faith grown so weak? The darkness is not to be feared—it is where truth hides."
2. **The Mob Forms:** As tension rises, charmed villagers gather to defend their priest. Six commoners, glassy-eyed and mumbling about protecting "Father," try to physically stop the "heretic" adventurers. The party must resolve this non-lethally or face grave moral consequences.
3. **The Mask Slips:** When faced with undeniable evidence (touching him with the holy symbol, splashing him with holy water, or forcing him to look at his reflection), the Stalker's composure breaks. His face ripples and melts like wax.

**Rising Tension:** The sun sets during the confrontation. Shadows in the temple lengthen unnaturally, stretching like grasping claws along the walls (a lair effect from the partially desecrated altar).

**Midpoint Twist:** "Father Thomas" laughs—a hollow, resonant sound that echoes wrong. "You clever little lambs. But you're too late to stop the unveiling. The Silence comes for all." His face melts away entirely, revealing the smooth, rubbery, featureless visage of the Faceless Stalker.

**Transition to Act 3:** The Stalker attacks, initiating the boss encounter in the defiled sanctuary.

### Act 3: The Desecration
**Goal:** Kill the Stalker and reconsecrate the temple before the corruption becomes permanent.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **Sanctuary Battle:** Combat erupts among the pews. Overturned candles create areas of light and shadow. The Stalker uses pillars and shadows for ambush attacks while attempting to flee toward the crypts.
2. **The Crypt Pursuit (Optional):** If the Stalker flees, the party must pursue into the dark crypts beneath the temple. Here the creature has prepared—dead-end corridors, hidden alcoves, and the unburied corpse of Father Thomas.
3. **The Summoning:** At the defiled altar (or within the crypts if cornered), the Stalker channels the altar's dark energy to summon two Shadow Mephits as reinforcements.

**Climactic Encounter:** The Faceless Stalker makes its final stand, using summoned mephits and shadow-based lair actions. Destroying or cleansing the altar mid-fight significantly weakens the creature.

**Resolution Options:**
- Defeat the Stalker through combat (most likely)
- Cleanse the altar mid-fight (DC 15 Religion check as an action while holding a holy symbol)—this dismisses the mephits and gives the Stalker disadvantage on all attacks
- Trap the Stalker in the crypts using Father Thomas's holy symbol as a ward
- Capture the Stalker alive for interrogation (very difficult; it will fight to the death)

## Locations

### Overview Map
The Temple of the Lawgiver sits on a small hill at the eastern edge of Oakhaven, overlooking the village. A cobblestone path leads up from the main square. The temple grounds include the main sanctuary building, a small rectory attached to the north side, a graveyard to the south, and underground crypts accessible from within the sanctuary.

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[Temple of the Lawgiver]]

**Description:** A modest stone structure with a peaked roof and a square bell tower. Stained glass windows depict scenes of justice, mercy, and divine law—scales balanced by a silver hand, a king kneeling before a radiant figure, chains breaking beneath holy light. The windows, usually glowing with candlelight, are now covered with heavy black drapes "to aid contemplation." The interior smells of incense and something else—something faintly sweet and rotten.

**Key Features:**
- **The Altar:** A stone table that once radiated gentle warmth now lies draped in black cloth. Removing the cloth reveals dark symbols carved into its surface—the desecration in progress.
- **The Belfry:** The bell tower is accessed by a narrow spiral staircase. The rope has been cut; the bell itself is inscribed with holy words that cause pain to evil creatures.
- **The Font:** A stone basin of holy water near the entrance. The Stalker has been avoiding it; Sister Elara noticed "Thomas" never blesses himself upon entering.
- **The Pews:** Twelve rows of oak pews, sturdy enough to provide cover but heavy to move.
- **The Crypt Entrance:** A iron-bound wooden door behind the altar leads to stairs descending into darkness. A new lock bars the way.

**Encounters Here:** Charmed Villagers (Social/Combat), Faceless Stalker boss fight, Shadow Mephits

### Location 2: The Rectory
**Description:** A two-story attached building where Father Thomas lived and worked. The ground floor contains a modest kitchen, dining room, and study. The upper floor holds two bedrooms—Thomas's and the guest room where the Stalker stayed as "Brother Mathis."

**Key Features:**
- **Thomas's Study:** Locked desk contains his journal, parish records, and a hidden compartment with emergency gold (30 gp)
- **Guest Room:** Signs of the Stalker's preparation—scrawled notes on Thomas's mannerisms, a hidden vial of Dream-Lily, a strange gray cloak that feels oddly organic
- **Thomas's Bedroom:** The bed appears slept in, but clothes are neatly hung—too neatly for someone who left in a hurry

**Encounters Here:** Investigation/stealth challenges, possibly confrontation if discovered

### Location 3: The Crypts
**Description:** Dark tunnels beneath the temple housing the village's honored dead. Stone sarcophagi line the walls, each bearing the name and blessing of the interred. The air is cold and stale, smelling of dust and old stone—and something newer. Something rotting.

**Key Features:**
- **Family Vaults:** Six small chambers for notable families
- **The Sealed Crypt:** A previously empty vault now locked from outside—Father Thomas's body lies within
- **The Old Well:** A dry well in the deepest chamber, dropped into disuse. The Stalker uses it to hide evidence.
- **Narrow Passages:** Only 5 feet wide, limiting mobility for combat

**Encounters Here:** Possible Stalker pursuit, discovery of Father Thomas's body, optional ghost encounter

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Village Square | Temple | 5 minutes walk | None (charmed villagers may follow) |
| Temple | Rectory | Adjacent | Interior door connects |
| Sanctuary | Crypts | Stairs down | Darkness, narrow passages |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### [[Sister Elara]]
**Role:** Insider / Healer / Quest Giver

**Description:** A young woman in her early twenties with mousy brown hair and wide, frightened eyes. She wears simple acolyte robes of undyed wool and clutches a hand-carved wooden holy symbol so tightly her knuckles have gone white. Though her voice trembles, there's steel beneath her fear—the steel of someone who would rather die than see her faith corrupted.

**Personality:** Timid and soft-spoken normally, but finds unexpected courage when the temple or innocent lives are threatened. Deeply devout, almost naive in her belief that good must triumph. Blames herself for not acting sooner.

**What They Want:** To save the temple, honor Father Thomas's memory, and see justice done to the monster wearing his face.

**What They Know:** Temple layout, Thomas's daily routines, location of spare keys, the sequence of the desecration (she's been secretly watching), and that the communion wine is wrong somehow.

**How They Can Help:** Can cast *Sanctuary* (1/day), *Cure Wounds* (2/day), and *Detect Evil and Good* (1/day). Provides a key to the side entrance. Will fight if necessary but is not a warrior (use Acolyte stat block). Can perform the reconsecration ritual if no party member has divine magic.

#### [[Mayor Aldric Thornwood]]
**Role:** Authority Figure / Skeptical Ally

**Description:** A portly man in his fifties with a magnificent mustache and perpetually worried expression. He wears the chain of office even at home. His hands shake slightly from the Dream-Lily, but he's had less wine than most.

**Personality:** Pragmatic, conflict-averse, but ultimately protective of his people. Needs hard evidence before taking action against a respected religious figure.

**What They Want:** Peace and stability in his village. To avoid making accusations that could cause panic.

**What They Know:** Village history, who's been acting strange, where everyone lives.

**How They Can Help:** If convinced (DC 14 Persuasion with evidence), he can rally villagers to the party's side, prevent a riot, or authorize a search of the temple.

### Neutrals

#### [[Innkeeper Bess]]
**Role:** Charmed Informant

**Description:** A stout woman in her forties with flour-dusted hands and a normally cheerful disposition. Her eyes now have a glassy quality, and her smile seems painted on. She was one of the first to drink the tainted wine.

**Personality:** Under normal circumstances: warm, gossipy, protective of her customers. While charmed: defensive of "Father Thomas" to the point of irrationality, quick to anger at any criticism of him.

**What They Want:** (Charmed) To protect Father Thomas. (Normal) To understand what happened to her.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Initially friendly, becomes hostile if they speak against the priest. Once cured, deeply grateful and horrified by her behavior.

#### [[Old Jeb the Gravedigger]]
**Role:** Witness / Comic Relief

**Description:** A weathered man who claims to be "older than the crypts themselves." He's avoided the communion wine because "never trusted that sweet stuff."

**Personality:** Rambling, prone to dark humor about death, but surprisingly sharp. Speaks in riddles and complaints.

**What They Want:** To be left alone to do his job. To stop hearing strange sounds from the crypts at night.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Suspicious initially, helpful if they show respect. Will trade information for whiskey.

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: [[The False Priest]] (Faceless Stalker)
**Role:** Infiltrator / Cult Agent / Boss

**Description:** In its assumed form, it looks exactly like Father Thomas—an elderly man with kind eyes and silver hair, wearing white robes of office. But something is wrong. Its smile stretches too wide. It never blinks. Its shadow seems to move independently when you're not looking directly at it. In its true form, the creature is a hairless, gray-skinned humanoid with elongated limbs, claw-tipped fingers, and a smooth, featureless face like melted wax—no eyes, no nose, just a lipless mouth that opens too wide.

**Personality:** Arrogant and contemptuous of "lesser" beings, though it hides this behind Father Thomas's gentle demeanor. It mocks divinity and delights in corruption. When forced to reveal itself, it speaks with a hollow, resonant voice that seems to come from everywhere at once.

**Motivation:** To complete its mission for the Covenant and earn advancement within the cult's ranks. It views this assignment as a stepping stone to greater power. "The truth cannot be veiled forever. The Silence is coming, and when it does, only those who embraced the dark will survive."

**Methods:** Manipulation, impersonation, poison, patient corruption. It prefers to avoid direct combat, using charmed villagers as shields and summoned creatures as distractions.

**Weakness:**
- Cannot touch holy symbols dedicated to lawful or good deities without pain
- Cannot cast a reflection in holy water
- Bright light (such as the *Light* cantrip) cancels its darkvision advantage
- The temple bell, if rung, causes it 1d6 psychic damage per round (the party could repair the rope)

**Combat Notes:**
- **HP:** 52 (8d8 + 16)
- **AC:** 14 (natural armor)
- **Speed:** 40 ft.
- **Multiattack:** Two claw attacks (+5 to hit, 1d6+3 slashing)
- **Shapechanger:** Can assume any Medium humanoid form
- **Ambusher:** Has advantage on attacks against surprised creatures
- **Shadow Stealth:** In dim light or darkness, can take the Hide action as a bonus action
- **Summon Shadows:** Once per day, can summon 2 Shadow Mephits as an action

#### Secondary Antagonist: [[Shadow Mephit]] (x2)
**Role:** Summoned Minions

**Description:** Small, bat-winged creatures made of living shadow. Their forms constantly shift and blur, and their laughter sounds like wind through dead leaves.

**Connection to Primary:** Summoned by the Stalker using energy from the defiled altar. They serve mindlessly and vanish if the altar is cleansed.

**Combat Notes (CR 1/2 each):**
- **HP:** 21 (6d6)
- **AC:** 12
- **Darkvision:** 60 ft.
- **Blinding Breath (Recharge 6):** 15 ft. cone; DC 10 DEX save or blinded for 1 minute
- **Death Burst:** Explodes in a 5 ft. radius of darkness when killed; DC 10 CON save or blinded for 1 minute
- **Claw Attack:** +4 to hit, 1d4+2 slashing

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Charmed Mob
**Location:** Temple Courtyard or Sanctuary Entrance

**Trigger:** Publicly accusing Father Thomas of being an imposter, or being caught searching the rectory.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Commoner | 6 | Under Dream-Lily influence; glassy eyes, slurred speech |

**Tactics:** The villagers grapple and shove, trying to restrain the "troublemakers" so Father Thomas can deal with them. They fight to subdue, not kill. Killing any villager causes the others to flee screaming—but word spreads, and the party becomes wanted criminals.

**Difficulty:** Hard (Moral difficulty rather than combat difficulty)

**Terrain Features:**
- Temple steps provide high ground
- A water trough can be used to splash and wake villagers (DC 12 CON save to shake off the Dream-Lily for 1 minute)
- Sister Elara can cast *Sanctuary* on a party member

**Rewards:** None directly. Successfully resolving this without casualties grants 50 XP and maintains the party's heroic reputation.

#### Encounter 2: The Crypt Guardian (Optional)
**Location:** Temple Crypts

**Trigger:** Entering the crypts without proper blessing or light source.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Shadow | 1 | Former priest, corrupted by desecration |

**Tactics:** The shadow emerges from Father Thomas's corpse if the party disturbs it without first offering a prayer. It attacks from darkness, draining Strength. If reduced to half HP, it flees into the walls.

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Terrain Features:**
- Narrow 5 ft. passages limit movement
- Sarcophagi provide partial cover
- Complete darkness (no natural light sources)

**Rewards:** Defeating or putting the shadow to rest reveals a *Potion of Healing* clutched in Father Thomas's hand—he grabbed it instinctively when attacked but never had time to drink it.

#### Boss Encounter: The Thing in the Sanctuary
**Location:** Main Sanctuary Hall (or Crypts if pursuing)

**Setup:** When the Stalker's disguise is shattered, it hisses with rage and attacks. If in the sanctuary, it fights among the pews. If in the crypts, it uses the narrow passages for ambush. At the start of round 2, it uses its summoning ability to call Shadow Mephits from the defiled altar.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| [[Faceless Stalker]] | 1 | CR 2 (450 XP) |
| Shadow Mephit | 2 | CR 1/2 each (100 XP each), summoned round 2 |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 (Round 1):** Stalker uses its reach and 40 ft. speed to hit-and-run, hiding behind pillars and pews. Tries to separate party members.
2. **Phase 2 (Rounds 2-3):** Summons mephits, which use Blinding Breath to disable party members while the Stalker goes for killing blows on isolated targets.
3. **Phase 3 (Below Half HP):** Stalker fights defensively, trying to reach the altar to channel more dark energy. If the altar is already cleansed, it attempts to flee to warn the Covenant.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:**
On initiative count 20 (losing ties), while the altar remains defiled, one of the following effects occurs:
- Shadows lash out: One creature within 30 ft. of the altar must make DC 12 DEX save or take 1d6 necrotic damage
- Darkness spreads: All light sources within 30 ft. of the altar dim; bright light becomes dim light until initiative 20 of the next round
- Whispers of doubt: One creature must make DC 12 WIS save or have disadvantage on its next attack roll

**Victory Conditions:** The Stalker is slain (preferred) or driven off (risky—it will return with reinforcements).

**Rewards:**
- **XP:** 650 total (450 + 100 + 100)
- **The Silver Letter:** Hidden in the Stalker's robes—orders from "The Silver Mask" detailing the mission and mentioning a "retrieval team" heading to the "Ruins of the Dawn"
- **Temple Funds:** 150 gp in the temple vault (party should probably return this to help rebuild the congregation)
- **Vial of Midnight Oil:** Rare alchemical ingredient from the Stalker's supplies, worth 50 gp or useful for shadow-related magic
- **Stalker's Cloak:** Provides advantage on Stealth checks in dim light (requires attunement, feels disturbingly organic)

### Social Encounters

#### The Evening Sermon
**Location:** Temple Sanctuary

**NPCs Present:** Faceless Stalker (as Father Thomas), Sister Elara, 20 villagers, possibly Mayor Thornwood

**Stakes:** Gathering initial evidence without raising suspicion.

**Information Available:**
- The Stalker's unnatural mannerisms (observation)
- Villagers' drugged state (questioning)
- Sister Elara's fears (private conversation)
- The covered windows and draped altar (visual inspection)

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Insight | 12 | Notice "Thomas" never blinks, smile too wide | Appear convinced by the sermon |
| Perception | 14 | Spot Thomas avoiding the holy water font | Miss subtle wrongness |
| Religion | 13 | Recognize sermon contains subtle heresies | Think the theology is just different |
| Medicine | 15 | Notice villagers show signs of drugging | Assume they're just tired |
| Stealth | 12 | Observe without Thomas noticing attention | Thomas marks party as potential threats |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Party gathers multiple clues and Thomas doesn't notice their suspicion
- Moderate: Party gets some information but Thomas becomes wary
- Worst: Party is obvious in their investigation; Thomas prepares for confrontation

#### Convincing the Mayor
**Location:** Mayor's House

**NPCs Present:** Mayor Aldric Thornwood, possibly his wife Margaret

**Stakes:** Gaining official support for investigating the temple.

**Information Available:**
- Village history and Father Thomas's character
- Who has been acting strangely
- Authority to conduct an official investigation

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 14 | Mayor agrees to support investigation | Mayor asks party to drop the matter |
| Evidence presentation | 12 | Each piece of evidence reduces DC by 2 | Weak evidence makes Mayor more skeptical |
| Intimidation | 16 | Mayor cooperates out of fear | Mayor calls guards; party must flee |
| Deception | 15 | Mayor believes cover story for why party needs access | Mayor becomes suspicious of party's motives |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Mayor authorizes search, provides key to temple, promises to keep villagers calm
- Moderate: Mayor is skeptical but won't interfere; party acts without official sanction
- Worst: Mayor warns "Father Thomas" about the troublemakers

### Exploration Challenges

#### Searching the Rectory
**Location:** Father Thomas's private quarters

**Description:** A two-story building connected to the temple. Modest furnishings, religious texts, the daily trappings of a village priest's life—but also evidence of the Stalker's presence if one knows where to look.

**Skills Useful:** Investigation, Perception, Sleight of Hand (for locks), Stealth (avoiding detection)

**Hazards:**
- Creaky floorboards (DC 12 Stealth or alert anyone nearby)
- Locked desk drawer (DC 14 Sleight of Hand or DC 16 Strength to break)
- "Thomas" may return unexpectedly (DM discretion)

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Thomas's journal (entries stop mid-sentence: "Brother Mathis asked me about the vault today. There's something strange about his sm—")
- Empty vials of Dream-Lily extract
- Thomas's discarded holy symbol (causes 1d6 radiant damage to the Stalker on touch)
- 30 gp in emergency funds
- A letter from the Bishop mentioning concerns about cult activity in the region

#### The Crypts Below
**Location:** Underground burial chambers

**Description:** Cold, dark, cramped. Stone sarcophagi hold the village's honored dead going back generations. The smell of dust and old bones mingles with something fresher—something wrong.

**Skills Useful:** Investigation, Perception, Survival (tracking), Religion (identifying desecration)

**Hazards:**
- Complete darkness (torch or *Light* spell required)
- Narrow passages (no room for flanking; difficult terrain for Medium creatures)
- Father Thomas's corpse (DC 10 CON save or frightened for 1 minute upon discovery)
- Possible shadow encounter (see optional combat)

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Father Thomas's body (evidence of murder; can be shown to villagers)
- The corpse's final blessing (if properly laid to rest with prayers, his spirit grants Inspiration to one party member)
- Old relics in the deep crypts (DC 16 Investigation: a *Vial of Holy Water* and a *Scroll of Protection from Evil and Good*)

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Thomas's strange behavior | Sermon / Village | Observation | Suspicion of imposter |
| No reflection in holy water | Font (Sister Elara's tip) | Visual confirmation | Proof of unnatural nature |
| Drugged communion wine | Wine cellar | Medicine/Nature check | Understanding of villager state |
| Journal entries stop abruptly | Rectory study | Investigation | Proof something happened to real Thomas |
| Discarded holy symbol | Rectory wastebin | Search | Weapon against the Stalker |
| Dream-Lily vials | Rectory guest room | Search | Proof of deliberate poisoning |
| Father Thomas's body | Crypts | Exploration | Undeniable evidence of murder |
| Letter from Silver Mask | Stalker's corpse/robes | Combat victory | Hook to future adventures |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. Old Jeb the gravedigger acts suspicious and avoids the temple—but he's just superstitious and doesn't like the "new feeling" there
2. The blacksmith has been seen entering the temple at odd hours—he's having a crisis of faith and seeking private confession, not conspiring with the Stalker
3. Strange symbols on Thomas's desk appear sinister—they're actually just his personal shorthand for sermon notes

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The beloved Father Thomas is not only dead but was murdered by something wearing his face. The creature has been systematically poisoning and corrupting the entire village.

**When It's Revealed:** The climactic confrontation when the Stalker's disguise fails—either through exposure to the holy symbol, holy water, or being cornered with undeniable evidence.

**Impact:** The revelation should be viscerally horrifying. Describe the face melting like candle wax, the limbs elongating, the mouth opening too wide. This creature has been hugging children, blessing marriages, and drinking tea with the mayor while wearing a murdered man's skin. The villagers' trust has been fundamentally violated.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Alarm Glyph | Rectory door | Opening without speaking prayer | Psychic alarm alerts Stalker | 14 Perception to spot | None (alerts enemy) |
| Poisoned Wine | Temple cellar | Drinking | Dream-Lily poisoning | 13 CON save | Charmed for 8 hours |
| Shadow Snare | Crypt entrance | Stepping on marked stone | Grasping shadows restrain | 12 DEX save | Restrained until escape (DC 12) |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Complete Darkness | Crypts | Blinded without light source | Torches, *Light* cantrip, darkvision |
| Narrow Passages | Crypts | Difficult terrain, no flanking | Ranged combat, single-file tactics |
| Unstable Candles | Sanctuary | Fire risk during combat (1d4 fire) | Avoid knocking over, or use tactically |
| Grasping Shadows | Near defiled altar | Disadvantage on DEX saves | Cleanse altar or stay in bright light |

### Puzzles

#### The Locked Crypt
**Location:** Crypts—the sealed vault containing Father Thomas's body

**Description:** A heavy iron door with a new lock. No key exists except the one the Stalker carries. The door bears religious inscriptions that have been partially scratched away.

**Solution:** Multiple approaches work:
- Pick the lock (DC 15 Sleight of Hand)
- Break the door (DC 18 Strength, very loud)
- Speak the temple's traditional blessing while touching the door (Sister Elara knows this)
- Find the Stalker's key (on its person)

**Hints:**
- The scratched inscriptions suggest something holy was removed
- Sister Elara mentions "Father Thomas always said the crypts protect the faithful"
- Old Jeb knows the traditional prayers used when entering the crypts

**Bypass Options:** Breaking the door alerts anyone in the temple. The Stalker may confront the party here.

#### The Desecration Ritual
**Location:** Temple Altar

**Description:** To reconsecrate the altar, the party must understand what was done to defile it. Black cloth covers carved symbols. Candles burn with purple flames. A sense of wrongness pervades the area.

**Solution:** Remove the black cloth, wash the carved symbols with holy water, and speak words of consecration (DC 12 Religion check for non-divine casters; automatic success for Clerics/Paladins). Takes 10 minutes if done carefully, 1 action if done during combat with DC 15 Religion check.

**Hints:**
- Sister Elara describes the normal blessing ritual
- The carved symbols are mirror-images of protective wards (reversing corruption)
- Holy water in the font could be used

**Bypass Options:** A Cleric or Paladin can cast *Ceremony* for instant reconsecration. *Dispel Magic* at 3rd level suppresses the desecration for 1 hour.

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| How to handle charmed mob | Subdue non-lethally / Fight through / Flee | Heroic reputation maintained / Wanted criminals / Adventure delayed |
| Confront publicly or privately | Public accusation / Private trap | Mob scene / Smaller but more dangerous fight |
| What to do with temple funds | Keep / Return / Split | Moral choice; affects reputation |
| Stalker's fate | Kill / Capture / Let escape | Clean ending / Interrogation opportunity / Future enemy |
| Father Thomas's burial | Proper rites / Leave body / Desecrate further | Spirit's blessing / Haunting / Corruption spreads |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Infiltrate the temple at night, gather evidence, confront the Stalker alone in the crypts. Harder combat but avoids mob scene entirely.
- **Diplomacy:** Convince the Mayor and Sister Elara to organize a "test of faith" for Thomas—exposure to holy relics that would prove his nature. Requires excellent social skills.
- **Brute Force:** Storm the temple, fight through whatever opposes them. Quick but morally costly if villagers are harmed.
- **Deception:** Pretend to be converted by "Thomas's" new teachings to get close. High risk, high reward—if caught, the Stalker has time to prepare.
- **Divine Intervention:** If the party has a Cleric or Paladin, *Detect Evil and Good* immediately reveals the Stalker's nature—but now they know, and it knows they know.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- Party is driven out of town: They can return with reinforcements (perhaps soldiers from [[Riverguard]]) but the desecration will be complete—the temple becomes a dungeon to clear rather than a crime to prevent
- Stalker escapes: The creature reports to the Covenant; the party is now marked for death. Future adventures include assassination attempts.
- Party is captured: They wake in the crypts, stripped of weapons, with the Stalker gloating. Escape scenario becomes priority.
- Accidental villager deaths: The party must flee and find redemption elsewhere. Oakhaven becomes hostile territory.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** The surviving villagers gather in the dawn light, freed from the Dream-Lily's fog. There are tears as they learn of Father Thomas's death, but also gratitude—the heroes saved them from a fate far worse. Sister Elara, trembling but resolute, speaks the words of reconsecration over the altar as golden light returns to the stained glass windows. The bells ring for the first time in days. Oakhaven celebrates its salvation with a feast, and the party is honored as heroes.

**If Failed:** The altar's corruption becomes permanent at midnight. Villagers wake the next morning changed—listless, their eyes shadowed, speaking of "the peace that awaits in darkness." Over the following weeks, Oakhaven becomes a cult stronghold. Sister Elara flees (if alive) to warn others. The region grows more dangerous as the Covenant extends its influence.

**If Partial Success:** The Stalker is killed but the altar remains defiled (or vice versa). Sister Elara can complete the reconsecration over several days of prayer and fasting. The village recovers, but the scars run deep. Some villagers lost loved ones to the Stalker's manipulations and harbor resentment toward those who "didn't act sooner."

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth knows their agent was destroyed; they will be more cautious (and more thorough) in future infiltrations
- Oakhaven becomes a strongpoint against shadow-aligned threats, its temple strengthened by surviving corruption
- Sister Elara grows into a capable religious leader, potentially becoming a powerful ally
- Other villages in Westmark hear the story; some become more vigilant, others dismiss it as exaggeration
- The "Ruins of the Dawn" become a point of interest—what was the Covenant trying to retrieve there?

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. The Letter from the Silver Mask mentions a "retrieval team" heading to the **Ruins of the Dawn**—this is the hook for the next adventure
2. Who is "The Silver Mask"? A cult leader? A title passed between agents? Something inhuman?
3. Where did the Faceless Stalker come from? Are there more infiltrators in other communities?
4. The Dream-Lily must come from somewhere—who supplies the Covenant with such quantities of rare narcotics?

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Sister Elara | Becomes high priestess of the temple | Flees to warn others; becomes wandering prophet |
| Mayor Thornwood | Grateful ally; supports party in future endeavors | Fully charmed; becomes cult puppet |
| Innkeeper Bess | Mortified by her behavior; offers lifelong free lodging | Cult convert; inn becomes Covenant safe house |
| Father Thomas (spirit) | Passes peacefully if properly buried | Becomes vengeful ghost haunting the temple |
| Old Jeb | Continues being cranky but respects the party | Actually fine; too ornery to convert |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Play up the horror elements: the wrongness of "Thomas's" smile, shadows that move wrong, the growing unease. Let players marinate in the creepiness before action begins.
- Sister Elara is the emotional core—her fear and faith should drive the urgency. Let players connect with her before endangering her.
- The charmed mob is a moral test. Make the villagers sympathetic—these are good people under mental control. Killing them should feel awful.
- The Stalker is intelligent. If it suspects the party, it takes precautions: warns villagers about "dangerous strangers," prepares ambush sites, considers fleeing to fight another day.
- Use the environment. The temple is full of religious imagery, light and shadow, sacred objects that hurt the Stalker. Reward creative use of setting.

### Pacing Suggestions
- **Session 1:** Hook, investigation phase (Act 1), build suspense. End on a cliffhanger—perhaps the party discovers Father Thomas's journal, or the Stalker notices them snooping.
- **Session 2:** Confrontation (Act 2), mob scene, revelation, boss fight (Act 3), resolution. This session should feel more action-packed than the first.
- If running as one-shot: Compress the investigation by having Sister Elara provide more direct clues. Skip the optional crypt encounter.

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Attack "Thomas" immediately without evidence | Villagers defend him; mob encounter happens early and the party looks like the villains |
| Try to cure the villagers before confronting the Stalker | Noble but ineffective—the Stalker will simply drug them again. Works as delaying tactic. |
| Attempt to flee town and return with reinforcements | The desecration completes; adventure becomes harder rescue/clearing mission |
| Use *Detect Evil* or similar magic on "Thomas" | The Stalker is revealed immediately—it attacks in desperation, making the fight harder but shorter |
| Search the crypts first | They find Thomas's body, which is damning evidence, but might alert the Stalker through lair action |
| Ring the temple bell | It still works! The sound causes pain to the Stalker and breaks some villagers' charm early |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties (3 players, level 1):**
- Reduce Stalker HP to 40
- Remove one Shadow Mephit from the summon
- Have Sister Elara actively participate in combat with healing
- Make the charmed mob only 4 villagers
- Remove the optional shadow encounter

**For Stronger Parties (5+ players, level 3):**
- Increase Stalker HP to 65
- Add a third Shadow Mephit
- Give the Stalker a use of *Darkness* 1/day
- The charmed mob includes Innkeeper Bess (uses Bandit stat block)
- Father Thomas's corpse always spawns a shadow

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- The Silver Mask's letter mentions "the Dawn artifact must be recovered before the Synod learns of its location"—sets up conflict with [[The Arcane Synod]]
- References to "the Silence" and "the Unveiling" hint at the Covenant's ultimate apocalyptic goal
- The quality of the Stalker's equipment suggests significant cult resources and organization
- Old Jeb mumbles about "trouble coming from the old ruins east of here"—pointing toward the Ruins of the Dawn

## Secrets

1. The real Father Thomas is dead in the crypt, but his spirit lingers. If the party lays his body to rest with proper rites, he manifests briefly to bless them (grants 1 Inspiration to a party member of their choice) and whispers a warning: "The mask seeks the Dawn's light to extinguish it forever."

2. The Stalker isn't acting alone—a second cult agent (a human spy named "Mira") is observing from the village, posing as a traveling merchant. She doesn't intervene but reports the party's identities to the Covenant. This becomes relevant in future adventures.

3. The temple vault contains an ancient relic: the **Bell of First Light**, a hand-bell that can be rung to cast *Daylight* once per week. It's hidden in a secret compartment (DC 18 Investigation). This becomes crucial in future shadow-themed adventures.

4. Sister Elara is distantly descended from the temple's founder. If she survives and takes leadership, the temple becomes consecrated ground that provides advantage on saves against undead and fiends within its walls.

5. The Faceless Stalker was once human—a failed initiate of the Covenant who "volunteered" for transformation. In its final moments, if questioned, it might reveal a flash of its former self: "Please... I was just looking for truth... they promised answers..." This hint suggests the Covenant preys on seekers and scholars.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. The party completed the previous adventure (The Mine of Shadowed Ore) and is celebrating in Oakhaven when they notice the silent bells
2. Sister Elara was told by a traveling paladin to seek "capable adventurers who recently arrived in town"
3. The party's divine character (Cleric/Paladin) receives an ominous dream: a bell that rings silence, a face that wears faces
4. A letter from the party's patron mentions rumors of cult activity in Westmark and asks them to investigate

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **The Ruins of the Dawn:** The Silver Letter explicitly mentions a "retrieval team" heading to these ruins. What are they looking for? Can the party reach it first?
2. **The Silver Mask's Identity:** Who commands the Covenant in this region? Hunting down the Stalker's master becomes a personal quest.
3. **The Second Spy:** If the DM introduces Mira the merchant spy, the party might notice her watching them, setting up an urban intrigue adventure.
4. **The Bishop's Concerns:** Father Thomas received a letter mentioning cult activity. The Bishop in the regional capital might have more information—and more work for capable heroes.
5. **Sister Elara's Request:** Weeks later, Elara contacts the party—strange things are happening at the Ruins of the Dawn, and she thinks it's connected to the Stalker's mission.

**Prompt:**
**Interior of the Temple of the Lawgiver at dusk. Gloomy atmosphere with covered stained glass windows casting no colored light. An elderly priest in white robes stands at a defiled altar draped in black cloth, his posture subtly wrong, shoulders too tense, head tilted at an inhuman angle. Lengthening shadows seem to reach toward him like grasping fingers. In the foreground, partially hidden behind a stone pillar, a young woman in simple acolyte robes clutches a wooden holy symbol, her face a mask of terror and determination. Dust motes hang frozen in the single beam of fading sunlight. Cold blue-gray lighting contrasts with pools of absolute shadow.

### Climactic Encounter
**Template:**
> The priest's face melts away like wax, revealing a smooth, blank visage. His limbs elongate into claws. Adventurers recoil in horror. Magic flares in the room. The altar glows with a sick purple light. Horror action.

Fantasy horror illustration.

**Prompt:**
**A Faceless Stalker in mid-transformation, its priest's robes tattered and splitting as its body contorts. The kindly face of Father Thomas melts like candle wax, sloughing away to reveal smooth, gray, featureless skin beneath—no eyes, no nose, just a too-wide lipless mouth opened in a resonant scream. Its arms elongate into clawed appendages as it lunges toward a warrior holding a glowing holy symbol. Two Shadow Mephits spiral through the air above, their bat-wings trailing wisps of living darkness. The defiled altar behind radiates sickly purple necrotic energy. Overturned pews and scattered candles create chaos. One adventurer shields their eyes from a mephit's blinding breath while another prepares a spell. Dynamic diagonal composition capturing the moment of horrific revelation. Hyper-realistic digital art, photorealistic rendering, cinematic lighting with purple corruption contrasting warm candlelight, rich textures, dramatic atmosphere, depth of field, volumetric lighting, 8K quality, masterful composition.

## Notes
This adventure serves as a turning point in the campaign—the first time the party directly confronts the Covenant of the Unveiled Truth and learns they are an organized threat rather than isolated cultists. The horror elements should feel earned through investigation rather than cheap jump scares. The emotional core is betrayal: a trusted figure was murdered and replaced, and the entire village nearly fell to subtle manipulation rather than obvious evil.

Design inspirations: "The Thing" (paranoid infiltration horror), classic Call of Cthulhu investigation structure, Agatha Christie's village mysteries, and the body-horror transformation scenes from "Invasion of the Body Snatchers."

The non-lethal resolution to the mob encounter is crucial—this separates heroic adventurers from murderous vagabonds. Players should feel genuine moral tension when facing mind-controlled innocents.
