> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
Returning to or remaining in Oakhaven, the heroes notice a disturbing silence: the bells of the **Temple of the Lawgiver**, usually rung at dawn and dusk, have ceased. Villagers report that **Father Thomas** has been acting strangely, preaching a new, softer doctrine about "embracing the quiet dark." The adventurers must investigate the temple, uncover that the beloved priest has been replaced by a generic **Faceless Stalker** (a shapeshifting spy for the Covenant), and purge the defilement before the village is converted to the cult's cause.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Investigation / Horror

**Tone:** Mystery / Eerie / Suspense

**Themes:**
- Things are not what they seem

- Subversion of authority

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 2 Sessions

**Party Level:** 2

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate (High Social/puzzle difficulty)

**Combat Frequency:** Low

**Roleplay Emphasis:** High

**Exploration Emphasis:** Low

## The Hook

### How It Begins
While celebrating their victory at the mine (or arriving in town), the party notices the eerie silence at sunset. Unrest grows in the tavern; people whisper that the gods have abandoned them. **Sister Elara**, a young acolyte, secretly approaches the party, terrified that "Father Thomas has no reflection in the holy water."

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Sister Elara]]
**Motivation:** She fears for her mentor and the sanctity of the temple.
**What They Offer:** Access to the temple's vault (if she survives) and information.

### Initial Information
- Father Thomas is usually strict and precise; now he is lethargic and vague.
- He has locked the crypts, claiming "renovations."
- The "Shard of Shadow" (if the party has it) vibrates/hums when near the Temple.

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate.
**Consequences of Delay:** The stalker will finish ritually desecrating the altar, cutting Oakhaven off from divine magic permanently.

## Background

### The Situation
The **Covenant of the Unveiled Truth** sent a **Faceless Stalker** to replace Father Thomas. The creature murdered him three days ago and stuffed his body in the crypts. It is now using subtle enchantment magic and poisoned communion wine to make the villagers docile and suggestible.

### History
- **Week ago:** A "traveler" (the Stalker) stayed at the rectory.
- **3 Days ago:** Thomas disappears; the "new" Thomas emerges.
- **Now:** The bells stop; the desanctification ritual is 70% complete.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Faceless Stalker]] (Fake Thomas) | Corrupt the Temple | Poison wine, suppress worship |
| [[Sister Elara]] | Protect the Faith | Seek help, spy |
| [[Innkeeper Bess]] | Keep the peace (Charmed) | Defend "Father Thomas" from accusations |

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Expose and defeat the imposter priest.

### Secondary Objectives
- Find the body of the real Father Thomas (for closure/evidence).
- Purify the Altar.

### Hidden Objectives
- Secure the **Letter from the Silver Mask**.

### Success Conditions
- The Stalker is slain.
- The Altar is reconsecrated (requires Cleric/Paladin or holy water ritual).

### Failure Conditions
- The Stalker escapes to report on the party.
- The villagers riot and attack the party (induced by the Stalker).

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Investigation
**Goal:** Gather evidence without alerting the Stalker.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **The Sermon:** The party attends a service where "Thomas" gives a disturbing sermon about "The Peace of the Grave."
2.  **The Rectory:** Breaking into Thomas's quarters to find his journal (entries stop abruptly) or the poison vials.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The wine in the cellar is tainted with **Dream-Lily** extract (a narcotic).
- Thomas’s holy symbol is tossed in a trash bin (the Stalker can't touch it without pain).

**Transition to Act 2:** Confronting "Thomas" or being caught snooping.

### Act 2: The Unveiling
**Goal:** Force the creature to drop its disguise.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **The Confrontation:** Publicly accusing him or cornering him in the temple.
2.  **The Mob:** Charmed villagers try to stop the "heretic" adventurers. (Non-lethal force required).

**Rising Tension:** The sun sets; the shadows in the temple lengthen and become grasping claws (Lair effect).

**Midpoint Twist:** The "Priest" laughs, his face melting away to reveal the rubbery, blank visage of the Stalker.

**Transition to Act 3:** Boss fight.

### Act 3: The Desecration
**Goal:** Kill the monstrosity.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **Sanctuary Battle:** Fighting amongst the pews.
2.  **The Crypt:** If he flees, chasing him into the dark crypts where he has advantage.

**Climactic Encounter:** The Stalker uses the desecrated altar to summon **Shadow Mephits** to aid him.

**Resolution Options:**
- Physical defeat of the Stalker.
- Cleansing the altar mid-fight weakens him significantly.

## Locations

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: [[The False Priest]] (Faceless Stalker)

**Trigger:** Accusing the Priest.

**Enemies:**

**Location:** Main Hall

**Setup:** The Stalker sheds his skin and attacks.

**Enemies:**

|----------|--------|-------|
| [[Faceless Stalker]] | 1 | CR 2 |
| Shadow Mephit | 2 | Summoned on round 2 |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1.  **Phase 1:** Stalker uses reach and mobility to hit-and-run.
2.  **Phase 2:** Mephits blind the party; Stalker goes for the kill.

**Victory Conditions:** Stalker dead.

**Rewards:**
- **The Silver Letter:** Instructions from a superior.
- **Temple Funds:** 150gp (Party should probably return this).

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
**If Successful:** The Temple is restored. Elara becomes the new high priestess.

**If Failed:** The village falls to the cult; becomes a hostile location for future travel.

### Loose Ends
The letter mentions a "retrieval team" heading to the **Ruins of the Dawn**. This is the hook for Adventure 3.

## Secrets
1.  The real Father Thomas is dead in the crypt, but his spirit lingers to bless the party if they cleanse the altar (gives 1 inspiration).
