# The Stolen Supplies

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A logistics-focused urban interlude between major adventures. This short mission maintains momentum while providing a change of pace from the political intrigue of The Traitor's Masquerade. The wererat encounter foreshadows the corrupted creatures the party will face in the Whisperwood.

## Overview

Fresh from exposing Lord Valerius at the Masquerade, the party prepares for their dangerous mission into the Whisperwood by ordering specialized alchemical supplies from **Vex**, a gnomish alchemist who operates a shop near Highwall's docks. However, when they arrive to collect their order, they discover the delivery boy was mugged and the crate stolen by the **Rat's Nest**—a small-time gang of thieves operating out of a derelict warehouse on the waterfront. The party must track down the thieves and recover their supplies before the gang fences the goods, all while navigating the lawless underbelly of Highwall's dock district where even Commander Kaelen's iron discipline cannot reach.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Retrieval / Urban Skirmish

**Tone:** Gritty / Street-Level / Tense

**Themes:**
- The rot beneath civilization's surface
- Desperation breeds monsters (literal and figurative)
- Preparation determines survival

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 1 Session (3-4 hours)

**Party Level:** 4

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate

**Combat Frequency:** Moderate (2-3 encounters)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Moderate

**Exploration Emphasis:** Moderate

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party arrives at **Vex's Volatile Volumes**, a cramped alchemist shop wedged between a fishmonger and a rope-maker near the docks. Inside, they find Vex frantically bandaging a teenage boy's head wound. The gnome explains that his delivery boy, Pip, was ambushed returning from the harbor with the party's special order. Three thugs beat the boy and took the crate—marked with Vex's distinctive green wax seal.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** Vex Tinkerton
**Motivation:** Recover his reputation and avoid losing valuable supplies he cannot easily replace.
**What They Offer:** The supplies at no additional cost if recovered; information about the Rat's Nest gang's territory; a Potion of Healing as thanks.

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The thugs wore ratty gray cloaks and smelled of the sewers.
- Pip managed to follow them as far as the **Broken Anchor** district before losing consciousness.
- The gang is known locally as the "Rat's Nest"—petty thieves who've grown bolder lately.
- The supplies include Anti-toxins and alchemically treated weapon oils essential for the Whisperwood mission.

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate (within one day)

**Consequences of Delay:** The gang will fence the alchemical supplies to black market buyers by nightfall. If the party waits until tomorrow, the supplies are gone and must be replaced at triple cost and a week's delay—time they may not have.

## Background

### The Situation
The Rat's Nest is a minor gang that has recently come under new leadership: a wererat named **Skritch** who emigrated from the sewers beneath Rivergard after being driven out by [[The Black Lotus]]. Skritch has been recruiting desperate dock workers and petty criminals, using his lycanthropy to intimidate and, occasionally, "recruit" new members through infection. The gang doesn't know what they stole—they simply target anything that looks valuable. The crate is currently in their warehouse, waiting to be appraised by a fence who arrives at sunset.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- Three months ago, the Black Lotus purged the Rivergard sewer rats after they started operating above their station.
- Skritch fled to Highwall, seeing opportunity in the dock district's relative lawlessness.
- He's built a crew of eight thugs plus three wererats (including himself), operating out of an abandoned fish-packing warehouse.
- Commander Kaelen knows the gang exists but considers them beneath military attention—a mistake Skritch exploits.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| Vex Tinkerton | Recover his supplies and protect his reputation | Hire the party; provide information |
| Skritch | Build his gang into a power worth fearing | Theft, intimidation, infecting "worthy" recruits |
| Pip | Get revenge on the thugs who beat him | Sneak after the party to help; may get in trouble |
| Mags the Fence | Appraise and sell the stolen goods | Arrives at sunset; will flee if violence erupts |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** They recover their supplies and can proceed to the Whisperwood properly equipped. Skritch's gang is broken, removing a growing threat to Highwall's dock district. Vex becomes a useful contact for future alchemical needs.

**If the party fails:** They must either proceed to the Whisperwood without proper supplies (disadvantage against poison effects, no silvered weapons) or delay a week while Vex acquires replacements—during which time the corruption in the Whisperwood spreads further.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Recover the crate marked with Vex's green seal from the Rat's Nest warehouse before sunset.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Eliminate Skritch to prevent future thefts and infections.
2. Rescue any infected dock workers before they fully turn.
3. Recover the gang's stolen goods to return to other victims (reputation boost with dock workers).

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Discover that Skritch was driven out by the Black Lotus—potential intelligence about the criminal syndicate's operations.
2. Find evidence that someone has been paying the Rat's Nest to target specific shipments (hint: the Covenant is testing supply disruption tactics).

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The crate containing the party's supplies is recovered intact.

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- The crate is destroyed, lost, or sold before recovery.
- The entire party is incapacitated or infected with lycanthropy.

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Trail
**Goal:** Track the thieves from the ambush site to their hideout.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Scene of the Crime:** The party examines the alley where Pip was ambushed. Investigation or Survival checks reveal sewer stench on discarded rags, a trail of fish scales, and a dropped copper piece with teeth marks.
2. **The Broken Anchor:** Following the trail leads to this slum district where the party can gather information from locals—dock workers, street vendors, and beggars who've all lost something to the Rat's Nest.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The gang operates out of the old Saltbreeze Packing warehouse at the end of Gutfish Lane.
- There are "about a dozen" gang members, though numbers vary.
- Their leader is a "creepy pale fellow who never comes out in daylight."
- The warehouse has two entrances: the main loading doors and a back entrance through a collapsed wall.

**Transition to Act 2:** The party locates the warehouse and must plan their approach.

### Act 2: The Approach
**Goal:** Infiltrate or assault the warehouse and locate the crate.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **Casing the Joint:** The warehouse is a two-story decrepit building on a rotting pier. Gang members lounge outside, and lookouts watch from broken windows. The party must decide: stealth, deception, or direct assault.
2. **The Lower Floor:** The main warehouse floor is cluttered with stolen goods, old fishing equipment, and gang members playing cards or sleeping. The crate is visible but guarded.
3. **Complications:** Depending on approach—alarms raised, hostage situations, or a clean heist gone wrong when someone trips over a sleeping thug.

**Rising Tension:** As the party explores, they notice evidence of lycanthropy: claw marks, tufts of coarse fur, gnawed bones. The gang is more dangerous than it first appeared.

**Midpoint Twist:** When the party retrieves the crate (or is discovered), Skritch emerges from the upper floor with his two wererat lieutenants. He offers a deal: join him or die. The party can negotiate, fight, or flee—but fleeing means leaving the supplies.

**Transition to Act 3:** Combat erupts, either initiated by the party or by Skritch's ambush.

### Act 3: The Rat King
**Goal:** Defeat Skritch and his wererats; secure the supplies; escape the warehouse.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Warehouse Brawl:** Combat erupts among crates, nets, and unstable catwalks. Skritch fights with cunning, using terrain and his infected thugs as shields.
2. **The Pier Collapse:** During combat, damaged support beams threaten to collapse the pier. The party must balance fighting with escape before the warehouse sinks into the harbor.

**Climactic Encounter:** Skritch reveals his hybrid form and attacks with feral desperation. His wererat lieutenants flank while surviving thugs try to flee or surrender.

**Resolution Options:**
- **Total Victory:** Skritch killed, supplies recovered, gang broken.
- **Partial Victory:** Supplies recovered but Skritch escapes to plot revenge.
- **Pyrrhic Victory:** Supplies recovered but one or more party members infected with lycanthropy (creates future complication).

## Locations

### Overview Map
The adventure takes place in Highwall's dock district, moving from Vex's shop in the merchant area, through the Broken Anchor slum, to the Saltbreeze warehouse at the end of Gutfish Lane where the pier extends over the murky harbor waters.

### Primary Location
**Name:** Saltbreeze Packing Warehouse

**Description:** A rotting two-story warehouse built on a pier extending into Highwall's harbor. Once used for salting and packing fish, it was abandoned years ago when the pier's supports began failing. The building lists slightly toward the water, and the lower floor floods at high tide. The Rat's Nest has made it their home, appreciating that the constant water prevents fire and the collapsing pier discourages visitors.

**Key Features:**
- **Main Floor:** Open space filled with stolen goods, overturned crates, and gang members' bedrolls. A large cargo door faces the pier; a smaller door opens to Gutfish Lane.
- **Upper Floor:** Reached by a rickety wooden staircase. Skritch's private quarters plus storage for valuable stolen goods.
- **The Hole:** A collapsed section of floor revealing the flooded space beneath the warehouse—and access to the sewers where the wererats retreat when threatened.
- **Catwalks:** Unstable wooden walkways crisscross the upper portions, used by lookouts and as ambush points.

**Encounters Here:** All combat encounters occur in or around this location.

### Location 2: Vex's Volatile Volumes
**Description:** A narrow three-story shop squeezed between larger buildings near the commercial docks. The ground floor is crammed with bubbling alchemical equipment, dried herbs, and mysterious bottles. Vex lives upstairs with his apprentice Pip.

**Key Features:** Cramped but well-organized; strong chemical smell; a bell over the door; Vex's workbench dominates the center.

**Encounters Here:** Quest delivery and reward; no combat expected.

### Location 3: The Broken Anchor District
**Description:** A slum neighborhood named for the rusted anchor monument at its center. Narrow streets wind between decrepit tenements housing dock workers, fishermen, and those with nowhere else to go. The watch patrols here rarely.

**Key Features:** Maze-like alleys; overhanging buildings blocking sunlight; smell of fish, sewage, and desperation; suspicious residents.

**Encounters Here:** Social encounters for gathering information; potential minor ambush if party is conspicuous.

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Vex's Shop | Ambush Alley | 10 minutes | None |
| Ambush Alley | Broken Anchor | 15 minutes | Pickpockets, suspicious looks |
| Broken Anchor | Saltbreeze Warehouse | 10 minutes | Gang lookouts; slippery pier |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### Vex Tinkerton
**Role:** Quest Giver / Alchemist Contact

**Description:** A gnome in his middle years with singed eyebrows, stained fingers, and goggles perpetually pushed up on his forehead. He speaks rapidly, often finishing sentences with "yes, yes" while already moving to the next thought. Despite his scattered demeanor, his alchemical work is precise and reliable.

**Personality:** Anxious, generous, prone to tangential explanations about chemical reactions.

**What They Want:** His supplies back; his reputation intact; Pip's attackers punished.

**What They Know:** The Rat's Nest's general territory; the contents of the stolen crate; local dock district gossip.

**How They Can Help:** Provides a Potion of Healing upfront; offers future services at discount; can identify any strange substances the party finds.

#### Pip
**Role:** Information Source / Potential Complication

**Description:** A human boy of fourteen with a fresh bandage on his head and a burning desire for revenge. Scrappy, street-smart, and foolishly brave—he knows the dock district better than anyone.

**Personality:** Eager to prove himself; reckless; loyal to Vex who took him in.

**What They Want:** Revenge on the thugs who beat him; to help the party succeed.

**What They Know:** Followed the thieves partway; knows the Broken Anchor's layout; has heard rumors about the gang's "creepy leader."

**How They Can Help:** Can guide the party through the slums; knows shortcuts; might sneak after the party and provide a distraction or get captured (complication).

### Neutrals

#### Mags the Fence
**Role:** Information Source / Potential Complication

**Description:** A middle-aged halfling woman with sharp eyes and a nervous habit of counting coins. She appraises stolen goods for the Rat's Nest and other small-time criminals, taking a cut of sales.

**Personality:** Greedy but cowardly; will sell out anyone to save herself.

**What They Want:** Money; to avoid violence; to maintain her reputation as a reliable fence.

**Attitude Toward Party:** Terrified if confronted; will trade information for safety; knows the crate is valuable but not why.

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: Skritch
**Role:** Wererat Gang Leader

**Description:** In human form, Skritch is a thin, pale man with twitchy movements, yellowed teeth, and eyes that reflect light like an animal's. His gray hair is greasy and unkempt, and he constantly sniffs the air. In hybrid form, he's a nightmarish blend of human and giant rat—hunched, clawed, with a long naked tail and a face dominated by a twitching snout full of needle teeth. He wears tattered finery stolen from his victims, a mockery of the wealth he craves.

**Personality:** Paranoid, cruel, ambitious beyond his means. He fancies himself a crime lord in waiting but lacks the patience and cunning of true criminal masterminds. He compensates with brutality.

**Motivation:** Build the Rat's Nest into a power that rivals the Black Lotus; prove he's not the failure they cast out; infect enough "worthy" members to create an army of wererats.

**Methods:** Theft, intimidation, infecting those who impress him (whether they want it or not). He strikes from ambush, never fights fair, and always has an escape route planned.

**Weakness:** Pride—he can't resist gloating or proving his superiority. Cowardice—he'll flee rather than die. Silver—standard wererat vulnerability.

**Combat Notes:** Uses Wererat stat block (CR 2). Fights dirty: throws caltrops, kicks sand, uses hostages. Will attempt to flee through the floor hole to the sewers if reduced to half HP. Immunity to nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered makes him dangerous against unprepared parties.

#### Secondary Antagonist: Nix and Scratch
**Role:** Wererat Lieutenants

**Description:** Skritch's two most loyal followers, both infected by him after they impressed him with their cruelty. Nix is a former dock worker, large and slow; Scratch was a pickpocket, small and quick.

**Connection to Primary:** Absolutely loyal to Skritch, who gave them "the gift." They'll fight to the death to protect him—or at least until he abandons them.

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Alley Ambush
**Location:** Broken Anchor district alleyway

**Trigger:** Party is too conspicuous while gathering information; asks the wrong person about the Rat's Nest.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Thugs | 3 | Gang members sent to scare off snoops |

**Tactics:** Ambush from rooftops (one) and alley mouths (two). Try to intimidate rather than kill—they want the party to leave, not start a full fight.

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Terrain Features:** Narrow alley with crates for cover; clotheslines overhead (can be cut to entangle); slippery cobblestones.

**Rewards:** 15 gp combined; one thug might be captured for information.

#### Encounter 2: Warehouse Guards
**Location:** Saltbreeze Warehouse, main floor

**Trigger:** Party discovered during infiltration or launches assault.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Thugs | 4-6 | Varies based on party's approach; reduce if stealth successful |

**Tactics:** Thugs fight in pairs, trying to flank. They'll call for help after round 1 if not silenced. One will try to warn Skritch upstairs.

**Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (depending on numbers engaged)

**Terrain Features:** Crates for cover; unstable floor sections (DEX save DC 12 or fall prone); hanging nets (can be cut to trap enemies).

**Rewards:** 40 gp combined; stolen goods worth 50 gp; keys to locked storage.

#### Boss Encounter: The Rat King's Last Stand
**Location:** Saltbreeze Warehouse, main floor and catwalks

**Setup:** Skritch appears when the alarm is raised or when the party retrieves the crate. He transforms into hybrid form and attacks from the catwalk, leaping down to engage. His lieutenants flank from the Hole.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Skritch (Wererat) | 1 | CR 2; hybrid form; gang leader |
| Nix (Wererat) | 1 | CR 2; large, slow, strong |
| Scratch (Wererat) | 1 | CR 2; small, quick, flanker |
| Thugs | 2 | Remaining gang members; may flee |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1:** Skritch monologues from the catwalk, offering the party a chance to join or die. Lieutenants emerge from the Hole to flank. If party attacks, combat begins.
2. **Phase 2:** At half HP or when both lieutenants fall, Skritch attempts to flee through the Hole into the sewers. The pier begins to collapse from battle damage—party has 3 rounds to escape with the crate before the building sinks.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:** None (CR too low), but environmental hazards serve a similar function:
- **Round 2:** Support beam cracks; 10-foot section of floor becomes difficult terrain.
- **Round 4:** Catwalk collapses; creatures on it must DEX save DC 12 or fall 10 feet (1d6 damage).
- **Round 6:** Pier begins sinking; water floods in; building will collapse in 3 rounds.

**Victory Conditions:** Skritch killed or driven off; crate secured; party escapes before collapse.

**Rewards:**
- Skritch's Belt Pouch: 45 gp, 3 silver rings (15 gp each)
- Cloak of Many Fashions (common magic item, on Skritch)
- Gang Stash (hidden in Skritch's quarters): 120 gp, gems worth 50 gp

### Social Encounters

#### Gathering Information in the Broken Anchor
**Location:** Broken Anchor district—streets, taverns, market stalls

**NPCs Present:** Dock workers, beggars, street vendors, pickpockets, a retired sailor named One-Eye Grun

**Stakes:** Learning the Rat's Nest's location and defenses without alerting them

**Information Available:**
- Location of the warehouse (common knowledge, DC 10)
- Number of gang members (roughly a dozen, DC 12)
- Their leader's description and nocturnal habits (DC 14)
- The back entrance through the collapsed wall (DC 16)
- Rumors of "rat-men" among the gang (DC 18)

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Persuasion | 12 | Locals share what they know | Locals clam up; word spreads |
| Intimidation | 14 | Quick answers but locals resent party | Locals flee; gang is warned |
| Investigation | 12 | Find physical evidence (fur, claw marks) | Waste time; approach sunset |
| Streetwise (Insight) | 10 | Identify who knows useful info | Talk to wrong people; waste coin |
| Deception | 14 | Pose as buyers wanting to purchase from the fence | Cover blown; ambush triggered |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Party learns location, numbers, back entrance, and wererat presence.
- Moderate: Party learns location and general numbers.
- Worst: Party learns location but gang is warned; lookouts doubled; ambush prepared.

### Exploration Challenges

#### Scouting the Warehouse
**Location:** Gutfish Lane and the pier surrounding Saltbreeze Warehouse

**Description:** The party must observe the warehouse to plan their approach, identifying guard positions, entrances, and potential hazards.

**Skills Useful:** Stealth (avoid detection), Perception (spot guards and entrances), Investigation (identify weak points), Survival (track movement patterns)

**Hazards:**
- Lookouts in upper windows (Perception DC 14 to spot)
- Rotting pier boards (DEX save DC 12 or crack loudly, alerting guards)
- Territorial stray dogs (might bark, might be befriended)

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Identify the collapsed wall entrance (easier infiltration)
- Spot the catwalks and their instability (tactical advantage)
- Notice the flooding pattern (understand the Hole escape route)
- Find Mags approaching for her sunset meeting (potential capture/interrogation)

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Sewer smell on rags | Ambush site | Investigation | Gang lives near sewers |
| Teeth-marked copper | Ambush site | Investigation | Something inhuman in the gang |
| Warehouse location | Broken Anchor | Social encounter | Primary location |
| Back entrance | Broken Anchor (DC 16) | Social/Exploration | Easier infiltration |
| Wererat rumors | Broken Anchor (DC 18) | Social encounter | Need silvered weapons |
| Gang's fence | Observation | Exploration | Optional capture; time pressure |
| Black Lotus connection | Skritch's quarters | Investigation after combat | Future plot hook |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. A local drunk insists the Rat's Nest operates out of the old lighthouse—it's actually home to harmless squatters.
2. A rival gang (the Drowned Daggers) tries to point the party at the Rat's Nest as a distraction from their own operations.

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The gang's leader is a wererat, and some members have been infected.

**When It's Revealed:** When Skritch transforms during the boss encounter, or earlier if party notices clues (claw marks, fur, immunity to their weapons).

**Impact:** Changes the tactical situation—nonmagical, non-silvered weapons are useless against the wererats. Party may need to improvise (silvered weapons in the crate, fire, grappling). Also reveals risk of lycanthropy infection.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Alarm Bells | Main door | Opening without disabling | Bells ring; all guards alerted | DEX 14 to disable | None |
| Bear Trap | Near back entrance | Stepping on pressure plate | Restrained; 1d10 damage | Perception 12 to spot; DEX 12 to avoid | 1d10 piercing |
| Collapsing Crate Stack | Main floor | Tripwire | Crates fall; 15-ft area | Perception 14 to spot; DEX 14 to avoid | 2d6 bludgeoning |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Rotting Floorboards | Throughout warehouse | DEX save DC 12 or fall through (1d6 damage, into water below) | Move carefully; test boards |
| Flooded Sections | Lower floor, the Hole | Difficult terrain; hidden hazards; potential drowning | Avoid or wade through |
| Unstable Catwalks | Upper floor | Collapse if more than 200 lbs; DEX save DC 12 or fall | Single file; don't fight on them |
| Pier Collapse | End of combat | Building sinks; water floods in; 3 rounds to escape | Grab crate and run |

### Puzzles

#### The Locked Stash
**Location:** Skritch's quarters (upper floor)

**Description:** Skritch's personal lockbox, hidden under a loose floorboard, contains his emergency fund and evidence of Black Lotus involvement. It's locked with a combination padlock—three symbols must be aligned correctly.

**Solution:** The symbols are a fish, a rat, and a crown. Looking around Skritch's quarters reveals: a fish skeleton nailed above his bed, a crude crown drawn on the wall, and rats carved into his chair. The combination is the order he sees them from his bed: Fish-Crown-Rat.

**Hints:**
- The lockbox symbols are worn from use—Skritch opens it often.
- His bed faces a specific direction (toward his "trophies").
- A captured thug might be intimidated into revealing it.

**Bypass Options:** Thieves' tools (DC 18), break the box with STR check (DC 20, makes noise, may damage contents), find the key on Skritch's body.

## Rewards

### Treasure

#### Monetary
**Total Value:** Approximately 300 gp in coins and valuables

**Distribution:**
| Location | Contents | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Alley thugs | Mixed coins | 15 gp |
| Warehouse thugs | Mixed coins | 40 gp |
| Skritch's belt pouch | Coins, silver rings | 90 gp |
| Gang stash | Coins, gems | 170 gp |

#### Magic Items

|------|----------|------------|
| Cloak of Many Fashions (common) | Worn by Skritch | Skritch |
| Potion of Healing | Gift from Vex | Quest reward |
| 4x Potion of Poison Resistance | The stolen crate | The gang |

### Quest Rewards

- One Potion of Healing (thanks for saving his reputation)
- 10% discount on future purchases from Vex
- Vex's gratitude and willingness to help with alchemical questions

**Additional Rewards:**
- Returning stolen goods to dock workers earns their gratitude (advantage on social checks in the district)
- Commander Kaelen's grudging respect if informed of the wererat threat (potential future hook)

### Experience
**Combat XP:**
- Thugs (CR 1/8): 25 XP each (approximately 325 XP total for all thugs)
- Wererats (CR 2): 450 XP each (1,350 XP for three wererats)
- **Total Combat XP:** ~1,675 XP (419 per character for party of 4)

**Non-Combat XP:**
- Gathering information successfully: 100 XP
- Rescuing infected dock workers (if applicable): 100 XP
- Finding Black Lotus evidence: 50 XP

### Intangible Rewards
- **Reputation:** Known as problem-solvers in the dock district; Commander Kaelen takes note.
- **Allies Gained:** Vex Tinkerton (alchemist contact); Pip (eager informant); dock workers (grateful community).
- **Information Learned:** Wererats exist in the region; the Black Lotus drove them from Rivergard; something is disrupting supply chains in Highwall.
- **Story Hooks:** The Black Lotus connection; potential lycanthropy infection; Skritch's escape (if applicable).

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Approach to warehouse | Stealth / Assault / Deception | Affects number of enemies engaged; stealth reduces total combat |
| Deal with Skritch's offer | Refuse / Negotiate / Pretend to accept | Combat begins; buys time; potential ambush opportunity |
| Fleeing wererats | Let them go / Pursue into sewers | Skritch escapes to return later; extends adventure into dangerous territory |
| Infected victims | Kill them / Seek cure / Leave them | Moral choice; no right answer; possible future allies or enemies |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Infiltrate through the back entrance at low tide, grab the crate, escape without combat. Requires excellent stealth and timing.
- **Diplomacy:** Pose as buyers or Black Lotus representatives. Risky but could get the crate without fighting—until Skritch gets suspicious.
- **Brute Force:** Kick in the front door at dawn when the wererats are sleeping. Loud but effective against weakened enemies.
- **Deception:** Convince Mags the fence to help retrieve the crate in exchange for immunity. She can get inside without suspicion.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- **Party defeated but not killed:** Wererats don't want murder charges; they dump the unconscious party in an alley and flee with the goods. Party must pursue to Rivergard sewers or accept the loss.
- **Crate destroyed:** Vex can acquire replacement supplies, but it takes a week. Party can proceed to Whisperwood underprepared or delay (consequences in that adventure).
- **Party member infected:** Lycanthropy takes 2d4 days to manifest. They can seek a cure from Father Aldric (Remove Curse) before the next full moon or live with the consequences.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** The party has their supplies and can depart for the Whisperwood within the day. The dock district is safer without the Rat's Nest. Vex becomes a reliable contact. If reported to Commander Kaelen, he orders a sweep of the sewers—finding nothing but earning the party his attention.

**If Failed:** The party must delay their Whisperwood mission or proceed without proper supplies. Skritch's gang grows bolder. The Covenant's supply disruption test succeeds, encouraging further sabotage.

**If Partial Success:** Supplies recovered but Skritch escaped—he'll return for revenge later, possibly at the worst possible moment. Or supplies recovered but party member infected—creates a ticking clock subplot.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- Breaking the Rat's Nest creates a power vacuum in the dock district that other criminal elements will fill.
- Evidence of Black Lotus operations in Highwall reaches Commander Kaelen, straining relations with Rivergard.
- If Skritch escapes, he may appear later as a recurring enemy or unexpected ally against a common foe.

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. Why was the Black Lotus so thorough in purging the Rivergard wererats? What were they protecting?
2. The Covenant's interest in supply disruption—part of a larger campaign against the River Compact?

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Vex Tinkerton | Grateful ally; prospers | Loses reputation; may close shop |
| Pip | Grows up inspired by party | Tries to get revenge himself; likely dies |
| Skritch | Dead or fled to sewers | Grows his gang; becomes serious threat |
| Mags | Captured or flees; finds new clients | Continues fencing; warns other gangs about party |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Emphasize the time pressure—sunset is coming, and the fence will arrive. Use descriptions of the lowering sun to build tension.
- Play Skritch as theatrical and overconfident. He should monologue, giving the party chances to prepare or attack.
- The wererat immunity to normal weapons should be a surprise. Let players waste attacks before realizing the truth—then remind them their supplies include silvered weapon oil.
- The collapsing warehouse at the end should feel dramatic but not unfair. Give clear warnings and enough time to escape.

### Pacing Suggestions
- **Hour 1:** Quest introduction at Vex's shop; investigation at ambush site; travel to Broken Anchor.
- **Hour 2:** Social encounters in Broken Anchor; scouting the warehouse; planning the approach.
- **Hour 3:** Infiltration and warehouse combat; discovery of wererats; boss encounter.
- **Hour 4:** Boss resolution; warehouse collapse; return to Vex; rewards and wrap-up.

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to involve the town guard | Guards refuse to enter the Broken Anchor for "petty theft"—it's beneath them and dangerous |
| Attack in broad daylight | Wererats are weakened (disadvantage on attacks in sunlight) but more thugs are awake |
| Wait until dark | Wererats are at full strength; fewer thugs awake; crate may already be sold |
| Set the warehouse on fire | Effective against wererats but destroys the supplies unless retrieved first; draws attention |
| Try to cure infected gang members | Father Aldric can cast Remove Curse; requires restraining the victims first |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Reduce thug numbers by 2-3.
- Have Nix or Scratch be absent (hunting elsewhere).
- The wererats have already been injured by infighting (half HP).
- Include more silvered weapons in the crate.

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add 2-3 more thugs.
- Give Skritch a hostage (Pip snuck in to help and got captured).
- Include a Giant Rat swarm loyal to the wererats.
- The warehouse doesn't collapse—the fight continues until resolved.

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- The alchemical supplies (anti-toxins, silvered oils) are specifically for the Whisperwood—mention the dangerous creatures and corrupted environment awaiting the party.
- Skritch's ranting about the Black Lotus connects to the larger criminal underworld the party may encounter in Rivergard.
- If any party member is bitten, the threat of lycanthropy creates personal stakes for the Whisperwood adventure.

## Secrets

1. Skritch has a letter from an unknown patron offering gold for "testing Highwall's supply vulnerabilities." The letter is signed with a chain symbol—a Covenant code.

2. The Black Lotus didn't just drive Skritch out—they're systematically eliminating wererats from Rivergard because one of them discovered a Lotus secret. Skritch doesn't know what the secret is, but he knows his cousin died for learning it.

3. One of the infected dock workers, if cured, knows that a "high-ranking merchant" in Highwall paid the Rat's Nest to target specific shipments—including the party's. He can describe Tollmaster Coinsworth's assistant.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. The party completed [[The Traitors Masquerade]] and has intelligence pointing to the Whisperwood. They need supplies before departing.
2. Vex's shop was recommended by [[Lady Kaelen]] as a reliable source for specialized alchemical goods.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. If Skritch escapes, he'll reappear later—possibly allying with other enemies or seeking revenge at a critical moment.
2. The Covenant connection to supply disruption could lead to investigating who's funding such operations.
3. Lycanthropy infection creates a personal quest to find a cure or control the curse.

## Notes
- This adventure serves as a palette cleanser between the political tension of The Traitor's Masquerade and the horror survival of Shadows in the Wood.
- The wererat encounter introduces lycanthropy as a threat before the party faces more corrupted creatures in the Whisperwood.
- The supplies gained here (especially the Potions of Poison Resistance) are mechanically important for the next adventure—don't let the party skip this or proceed without them unless you adjust Shadows in the Wood accordingly.
- Skritch makes a good recurring villain if he escapes—petty but persistent, growing more dangerous each time.
