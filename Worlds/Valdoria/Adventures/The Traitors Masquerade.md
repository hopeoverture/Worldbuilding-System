> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
Armed with evidence implicating **Lord Valerius** in the Covenant's activities, the party travels to the capital city of **Highwall**. Valerius is hosting a grand Masquerade Ball to auction off "antiquities" (dangerous artifacts) to foreign buyers. The party must infiltrate the gala, secure proof of his treason (the **Black Ledger**), and expose him before he can flee. This concludes Act 1 by identifying the true scale of the threat.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Heist / Social Intrigue

**Tone:** Tense / Opulent / Deceptive

**Themes:**
- The rot in high society
- Masks and hidden faces

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Hard (Consequences are severe)

**Combat Frequency:** Low (One major fight likely)

**Exploration Emphasis:** Moderate (Manor layout)

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party is contacted by **Lady Kaelen**, a member of the **Grey Wardens** (Spy network/King's Eyes), who has noticed the party's disrupting of Covenant operations. She can get them invitations to the ball, but they must do the rest.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Lady Kaelen]]
**Motivation:** Root out corruption in the nobility.
**What They Offer:** Invitations, costumes, and a extraction plan.

### Initial Information
- Valerius keeps his records in a vault in his study.
- The auction takes place at midnight in the private gallery.

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** High (Must succeed before midnight auction ends).

## Background

### The Situation
Lord Valerius is a high-ranking Covenant member (The "Silver Mask"). He uses his family's shipping business to smuggle artifacts and funds excavation teams. The ball is a cover for a meeting of cell leaders.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Lord Valerius]] | Fund the next phase / Impress superiors | Sell artifacts |
| [[Lady Kaelen]] | Expose Valerius | Use the party as assets |
| [[Countess Iona]] (Guest) | Buy the cursed jewelry | Flirt/Bribe |

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Steal the **Black Ledger** from Valerius's vault.

### Secondary Objectives
- Identify other cult members at the party.
- Sabotage the auction.

### Success Conditions
- Ledger obtained.
- Party escapes or Valerius is arrested.

### Failure Conditions
- Party captured (leads to prison break scenario).
- Valerius destroys the ledger.

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Infiltration
**Goal:** Enter the manor and blend in.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **The Arrival:** Presenting invitations, costume checks, passing security (magical sensors).
2.  **The Mixer:** Gathering rumors, charming guests, spotting the guards' rotation.

**Information to Reveal:**
- Valerius leaves the party periodically to check the vault.
- The vault key is magical (a signet ring).

**Transition to Act 2:** Moving to the restricted wing.

### Act 2: The Heist
**Goal:** Bypass security and open the vault.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **The Distraction:** Creating a scene (bard performance, spilled wine, magical prank) to draw guards away.
2.  **The Corridor:** Sneaking past **Animated Armor** guards.
3.  **The Study:** Solving the puzzle lock on the vault (Astrology based).

**Rising Tension:** The clock ticks closer to midnight; Valerius begins the auction speech.

**Midpoint Twist:** The "Vault" is actually a Mimic planted to catch thieves—the real safe is behind the painting. (Okay, maybe just a trap).

**Transition to Act 3:** The Escape / Confrontation.

### Act 3: The Unmasking
**Goal:** Get out with the book.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **Caught in the Act:** Valerius returns early or the alarm trips.
2.  **The Ballroom Brawl:** Fighting erupts spills into the ballroom.
3.  **Valerius Reveals:** He uses a dark artifact to summon a **Shadow Demon** or transform.

**Climactic Encounter:** Party vs. Valerius (Warlock stats) and his elite guards.

**Resolution Options:**
- Publicly exposing him causes his allies to abandon him.
- Killing him requires a quick flight from the city guard.
