# The Traitor's Masquerade

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
Armed with mounting evidence implicating **Lord Aldric Valerius** as a high-ranking member of [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]], the party travels to the capital fortress-town of [[Highwall]] for the culmination of their Act 1 investigation. Lord Valerius is hosting his legendary annual Masquerade Ball at his opulent estate--ostensibly a celebration of the harvest, but secretly serving as a cover for the midnight auction of dangerous artifacts and a meeting of Covenant cell leaders from across the region. The party must infiltrate the gala disguised as guests, navigate treacherous social waters, locate and steal the **Black Ledger** from Valerius's hidden vault, and expose the traitor before he can flee justice. Success will reveal the true scope of the Covenant's conspiracy; failure will brand the heroes as criminals and allow the shadow to spread unchecked.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Heist / Political Intrigue

**Tone:** Tense / Opulent / Deceptive

**Themes:**
- The corruption rotting high society from within
- Masks and hidden identities--everyone wears a face
- Justice versus Law: doing what's right when the law protects the guilty
- The price of exposing dangerous truths

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 2 Sessions

**Party Level:** 4

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Hard (social consequences are severe; the finale is deadly)

**Combat Frequency:** Low (one minor skirmish possible, one major battle guaranteed)

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Very High (75% of the adventure is social infiltration)

**Exploration Emphasis:** Moderate (learning the manor's layout is critical)

## The Hook

### How It Begins
Following their recovery of the [[Dawn Key]] in [[Ruins of the Dawn]], the party receives an urgent message from an unexpected ally. A woman in a grey cloak intercepts them on the road to [[Highwall]], identifying herself as **Lady Seraphine Kaelen** of [[The Grey Wardens]]. She has been tracking the party's activities against the Covenant and believes they are the only ones capable of completing a mission the Wardens cannot undertake openly. Lord Valerius, known to the Wardens as "The Silver Mask," is hosting his ball in three days. The Grey Wardens have obtained invitations but cannot act directly without exposing their spy network. The party must do what the Wardens cannot: enter as wolves among sheep, steal the damning evidence, and bring a traitor to justice.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Lady Seraphine Kaelen]]
**Motivation:** Root out Covenant corruption in the nobility before it spreads to the throne itself. She has personal stakes--her brother was killed investigating Valerius two years ago, and the case was quietly closed.
**What They Offer:**
- Forged invitations identifying the party as minor nobles from [[The Greenfields]]
- Appropriate costumes and masks for the masquerade
- A detailed floor plan of the manor's public areas (the private wing remains unknown)
- An extraction plan: a boat waiting at the river dock behind the manor
- 200 gold pieces for expenses
- Ongoing support from the Grey Wardens if successful

### Initial Information
What the party learns from Lady Kaelen:
- Lord Valerius keeps detailed records of his Covenant activities in a document called the **Black Ledger**
- The Ledger is secured in a vault somewhere in his private study
- The midnight auction occurs in the Private Gallery and will feature dangerous artifacts
- Valerius wears a magical signet ring that serves as the vault key
- At least three other Covenant cell leaders will attend the ball in disguise
- [[Commander Kaelen]] of Highwall's garrison is her uncle, but she cannot involve him without compromising the Wardens

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Critical (the auction concludes at 2 AM; Valerius plans to depart by ship at dawn)

**Consequences of Delay:**
- The artifacts will be sold and scattered across the continent
- Valerius will flee to Covenant-controlled territory in the [[Mirelands]]
- Evidence connecting him to the conspiracy will be destroyed
- Other Covenant leaders will be warned, forcing the conspiracy deeper underground

## Background

### The Situation
Lord Aldric Valerius is one of the wealthiest nobles in [[Highwall]], owner of a shipping empire that has made him essential to the region's trade. Unknown to all but a handful, he is also "The Silver Mask," the Voice of Gold in [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]--the financial architect who launders money, smuggles artifacts, and funds excavation teams searching for ancient seals. His annual Masquerade Ball serves multiple purposes: it maintains his reputation as a generous patron of the arts, provides cover for meetings of cell leaders who would otherwise never gather, and enables the auction of artifacts too dangerous to sell through normal channels. This year's auction features items recovered from the ruins near [[The Citadel of Tears]], including a **Shard of Shadow** that could accelerate the Covenant's seal-breaking efforts.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- **Ten Years Ago:** Valerius was recruited by the Covenant after his first wife's death left him bitter and searching for meaning
- **Five Years Ago:** He rose to Voice of Gold by eliminating his predecessor (made to look like a shipping accident)
- **Two Years Ago:** Lady Kaelen's brother, a Grey Warden investigator, disappeared after getting too close to the truth
- **Six Months Ago:** Valerius began hosting artifact auctions, drawing Covenant leaders into the open
- **One Month Ago:** The party's disruption of Covenant operations in [[Oakhaven]] and [[Ruins of the Dawn]] has made Valerius nervous--he plans to liquidate his assets and relocate after this final auction

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Lord Aldric Valerius]] | Complete the auction and escape to Covenant territory | Charm, misdirection, overwhelming force if discovered |
| [[Lady Seraphine Kaelen]] | Expose Valerius and avenge her brother | Use the party as deniable assets |
| [[Countess Iona Blackwood]] | Purchase the cursed **Tears of Midnight** necklace | Seduction, bribery, any means necessary |
| [[Merchant Prince Rhaegar]] | Acquire the **Shard of Shadow** for unknown purposes | Outbid all competition; violence as backup |
| [[Captain Mira Thorne]] | Protect her employer Valerius at any cost | Vigilance, brutal efficiency |
| The Covenant Cell Leaders | Coordinate next phase of operations | Meet during the auction, exchange intelligence |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:**
- Lord Valerius is exposed and arrested (or killed resisting)
- The Black Ledger reveals the scope of Covenant operations across the region
- The party gains powerful allies in [[The Grey Wardens]]
- The artifacts are seized before they can empower the Covenant
- Act 1 concludes with the party as known enemies of the conspiracy

**If the party fails:**
- The party is branded criminals wanted for theft and assault on a noble
- Valerius escapes with evidence of the party's involvement
- The Covenant accelerates its timeline, warned of opposition
- The Grey Wardens are compromised and forced underground
- Act 2 begins with the party as fugitives rather than heroes

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Steal the **Black Ledger** from Lord Valerius's vault and escape the manor with evidence of his Covenant membership.

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. **Identify the Masks:** Determine which guests are Covenant cell leaders (worth 100 XP bonus each, maximum 3)
2. **Sabotage the Auction:** Prevent the sale of the **Shard of Shadow** or steal it outright
3. **Gather Intelligence:** Learn the Covenant's next major operation from overheard conversations
4. **Rescue the Entertainment:** Discover that the hired performers are actually prisoners forced to participate

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. **The Traitor's Ledger Entries:** The Ledger contains evidence implicating other nobles, including hints about corruption in [[Rivergard]]'s Gilded Council
2. **Lady Kaelen's Brother:** His body is in Valerius's cellar, preserved as a trophy--recovering it means everything to the quest giver

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- The Black Ledger is obtained AND
- The party escapes Valerius Manor with the evidence AND
- At least one of the following: Valerius is killed, captured, or publicly exposed

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- The party is captured and cannot escape before dawn
- Valerius destroys the Black Ledger
- The party kills innocents, turning public opinion against them
- The entire party is killed (captured characters can be rescued in a follow-up adventure)

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: The Infiltration
**Goal:** Enter Valerius Manor, blend in with the guests, and gather intelligence about the manor's layout and security.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Approach:** The party arrives by carriage at the manor gates. They must present their invitations and pass initial scrutiny. Guards check for obvious weapons (DC 12 Sleight of Hand to conceal small blades or spell components).

2. **The Grand Entry:** Descending the marble staircase into the ballroom, the party is announced as their cover identities. First impressions matter--DC 13 Charisma (Deception) to maintain composure under scrutiny of the nobility.

3. **The Mingling Hour:** The party separates to work the room. Each character can attempt two social interactions before dinner is announced. Possible encounters:
   - Charm a guard into revealing patrol schedules
   - Overhear gossip about Lord Valerius's strange late-night visitors
   - Identify [[Countess Iona Blackwood]] as an auction participant
   - Notice [[Merchant Prince Rhaegar]]'s hidden bodyguards
   - Spot a servant behaving nervously (actually a prisoner)

4. **The Dinner Service:** A formal seven-course dinner where guests are seated by "rank." The party is placed at a table with minor nobility--an opportunity to gather rumors or a risk of exposure if their cover stories don't hold up.

**Information to Reveal:**
- Lord Valerius periodically leaves the party to "check on preparations"--he's actually visiting the vault
- The vault key is his silver signet ring, which he never removes
- The private wing is guarded by **Animated Armor** that only responds to Valerius's command
- The auction begins at midnight in the Private Gallery, accessible only by invitation
- Several guests seem to recognize each other with coded gestures (Covenant cell leaders)

**Transition to Act 2:** After dinner, Valerius announces that "special guests" should proceed to the Private Gallery for the "exclusive collection viewing." The party must decide: attempt the vault now while security focuses on the auction, or infiltrate the auction for intelligence first.

### Act 2: The Heist
**Goal:** Access the private wing, bypass security, open the vault, and obtain the Black Ledger.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Distraction:** The party needs a diversion to draw guards from the private wing. Options include:
   - Stage a dramatic scene in the ballroom (drunken argument, romantic scandal, magical mishap)
   - Trigger a kitchen fire (Dexterity check to avoid actual harm)
   - Convince a guest to demand immediate audience with Valerius
   - Create a "medical emergency" requiring guard assistance

2. **The Restricted Corridor:** The private wing is patrolled by two **Animated Armor** suits (AC 18, HP 33) that activate if anyone without Valerius's ring enters. Options:
   - Stealth past during patrol gaps (DC 15 Stealth, three checks required)
   - Disable with dispel magic or similar effects
   - Lure them away with noise and trap them behind locked doors
   - Fight them quietly (each Armor alerts guards if combat lasts more than 2 rounds)

3. **The Study:** Valerius's study is trapped with a **Glyph of Warding** (5d8 thunder damage, DC 15 Dexterity save) on the door. Inside, they find:
   - A desk with coded correspondence (DC 16 Intelligence to decode--references "Project Corruption" in [[The Whisperwood]])
   - A painting of Valerius with his first wife (secret compartment behind it, DC 14 Investigation)
   - The vault door--an ornate iron safe built into the wall

4. **The Vault Puzzle:** The vault requires three elements to open:
   - **The Ring:** Valerius's signet ring pressed into a depression (alternatives: skilled forgery DC 18, mage hand + stolen ring, knock spell)
   - **The Constellation:** Rotating dials must align to form the constellation of "The Prisoner" (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or found in the desk correspondence)
   - **The Blood:** A drop of blood on a hidden needle (any blood works, but Valerius doesn't know this)
   - **Alternative:** DC 22 Thieves' Tools to bypass mechanically; failure triggers a silent alarm

**Rising Tension:**
- The clock ticks toward midnight; guests drift toward the Private Gallery
- Servants begin cleaning up, increasing foot traffic
- Valerius checks his pocket watch repeatedly, clearly expecting the vault alarm

**Midpoint Twist:** When the party opens the vault, they discover a horrible truth: Valerius keeps trophies of his enemies. Lady Kaelen's brother's Grey Warden cloak is displayed alongside other mementos. The Black Ledger is there, but so is evidence of murders spanning a decade. Taking everything means a heavier load and longer escape; taking only the Ledger is faster but leaves evidence behind.

**Transition to Act 3:** As the party exits the study, alarms sound throughout the manor. Either they triggered something, or Valerius has simply discovered the intrusion. The escape begins.

### Act 3: The Unmasking
**Goal:** Escape the manor with the Ledger--or expose Valerius publicly and bring him to justice.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Pursuit Begins:** Guards flood the private wing. The party must choose:
   - **Flee to the docks:** Fight through the servant passages to the river (3 Guard encounters)
   - **Blend back in:** Return to the ball and hide in plain sight (DC 16 Deception, disadvantage if combat occurred)
   - **Public exposure:** Reach the ballroom and reveal Valerius to the assembled nobles

2. **The Auction Interrupted:** If the party chooses public exposure or is cornered in the Gallery, the auction is in full swing. **Merchant Prince Rhaegar** is about to win the **Shard of Shadow** for 5,000 gold. The party can:
   - Announce Valerius's crimes to the assembled guests (DC 15 Persuasion; the Ledger provides advantage)
   - Steal the Shard in the chaos
   - Identify the three Covenant cell leaders before they can escape

3. **Valerius Reveals Himself:** Cornered or exposed, Lord Valerius drops his charming facade. His eyes flash with shadow, and he speaks with the voice of something older: "The Unveiled Truth will not be silenced by meddling children." He produces a dark artifact--a **Shard of Shadow** he kept for himself--and partially transforms, shadow tendrils erupting from his formal attire.

4. **The Ballroom Battle:** The climactic fight erupts in the grand ballroom. Chandelier crashes down (Dexterity save or 3d6 bludgeoning), panicked nobles flee or cower, and guards must choose between their transformed employer and the screaming guests.

**Climactic Encounter:** See Boss Encounter below.

**Resolution Options:**
- **Public Victory:** Valerius is defeated before witnesses; [[The Grey Wardens]] arrive to secure the scene; the party is hailed as heroes
- **Private Victory:** The party escapes with the Ledger via the river; Valerius is left alive but exposed when the evidence reaches proper authorities
- **Pyrrhic Victory:** Valerius is killed, but his body and the Shard are lost; the Ledger proves the conspiracy but damages the party's reputation
- **Noble Sacrifice:** A party member may allow themselves to be captured to ensure others escape--leading to a rescue mission in Act 2

## Locations

### Overview Map
Valerius Manor sits on a hillside overlooking [[Highwall]]'s wealthy district, with the River Valdris flowing behind it. The estate comprises:
- The Main House (three floors plus cellars)

- Western Wing (private family quarters, restricted)
- Gardens (hedge maze, gazebo, servant paths)
- River Dock (escape route, boat moored)

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[Valerius Manor]]

**Description:** An opulent estate of white marble and dark wood, built in the Imperial style with soaring columns and vast windows. The manor gleams like a jewel against the night sky, its hundreds of candles and magical lanterns casting the facade in warm gold. Inside, every surface drips with wealth: Calishite carpets, Elven tapestries, crystal chandeliers, and furniture carved from exotic woods. The effect is deliberately overwhelming--a display of power designed to intimidate visitors into submission.

**Key Features:**
- **The Grand Ballroom:** A two-story chamber with a marble dance floor, twin staircases, and a massive crystal chandelier (100 candles, magical). Capacity: 200 guests. The chandelier can be dropped (10d6 bludgeoning, 20-foot radius, Dexterity DC 15 half).
- **The Private Gallery:** A long chamber displaying "art" (actually artifacts). Guarded by two visible guards and one **Invisible Stalker** bound to protect the collection.
- **The Study:** Lord Valerius's private office, trapped and containing the vault.
- **The Cellars:** Wine storage officially; actually contains a hidden chamber with trophies and the remains of those who knew too much.

**Encounters Here:** The Ballroom Battle (Boss), Animated Armor patrol, social encounters throughout

### Location 2: The Private Gallery
**Description:** A narrow, high-ceilinged room lined with glass display cases containing "curiosities"--actually dangerous magical artifacts. Velvet ropes separate viewers from the merchandise. Heavy curtains block the windows. The auction occurs here, with chairs arranged theater-style before a raised platform.

**Key Features:**

### Location 3: The Study and Vault
**Description:** A wood-paneled room smelling of leather, tobacco, and old money. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the walls, filled with legitimate business ledgers and a few dangerous tomes. A massive mahogany desk dominates the center. Behind a portrait of Lord Valerius's deceased first wife is the vault--a circle of dark iron set into the wall, covered in astronomical symbols.

**Key Features:**
- **Trapped Door:** Glyph of Warding (thunder, 5d8, DC 15 Dex half)
- **The Desk:** Contains coded correspondence, a hidden drawer (DC 14 Investigation) with blackmail material
- **The Vault:** Three-part lock (ring, constellation, blood)
- **The Painting:** Portrait with hidden compartment; contains a spare vault key (backup signet ring) and 200 gold

**Encounters Here:** Trap, puzzle, discovery of trophies

### Location 4: The Servant Passages
**Description:** Narrow corridors hidden behind the walls, allowing servants to move throughout the manor unseen. Plain whitewashed walls, worn wooden floors, and dim lighting from occasional oil lamps. The passages connect all major rooms and lead to the kitchens, cellars, and exterior exits.

**Key Features:**
- **Listening Points:** Grates that allow observation of major rooms
- **Hidden Doors:** Disguised as wall panels, DC 15 Investigation to spot from public side
- **Cellar Access:** Stairs leading down to wine storage and... other things
- **Dock Exit:** A tunnel emerging near the river dock

**Encounters Here:** Servant discovery, guard patrols, escape route

| Manor | Lady Kaelen's boat | 50 feet | Open ground, possible pursuit |

## Key NPCs

### Allies

#### Lady Seraphine Kaelen
**Role:** Quest Giver / Handler

**Description:** A lean woman in her early thirties with sharp features, grey-green eyes, and auburn hair kept practically short. She wears nondescript traveling clothes but moves with the fluid grace of someone trained to fight. A Grey Warden cloak clasp--a silver oak leaf--is her only ornamentation.

**Personality:** Controlled, professional, and mission-focused, with flashes of dry humor. Beneath the calm exterior burns cold fury for her brother's killer. She won't compromise the mission for revenge, but she desperately wants both.

**What They Want:** Valerius exposed, evidence secured, her brother's killer brought to justice

**What They Know:**
- Full details of Valerius's public activities
- The manor's public floor plan
- That the Covenant calls Valerius "The Silver Mask"
- Her brother Aldric disappeared investigating Valerius
- Commander Kaelen is her uncle, but involving him would compromise the Wardens

**How They Can Help:**
- Provides invitations, costumes, and cover identities
- Waits with a boat at the river dock for extraction
- Can create a distraction outside the manor if signaled (DC 15 Perception to spot her signal lantern)
- Will shelter the party afterward if they need to hide

### Neutrals

#### Countess Iona Blackwood
**Role:** Competing Auction Participant / Potential Ally or Obstacle

**Description:** A striking woman of fifty with silver-streaked black hair, pale skin, and eyes like chips of ice. She wears a gown of midnight blue velvet and a mask of black feathers. Her jewelry alone could purchase a small village.

**Personality:** Imperious, calculating, and utterly convinced of her own superiority. However, she holds no loyalty to Valerius and cares only about acquiring the **Tears of Midnight** necklace--a cursed item she believes can restore her dead daughter.

**What They Want:** The Tears of Midnight at any cost

**Attitude Toward Party:** Suspicious initially; can be turned into an ally if the party offers to help her obtain the necklace, or a useful distraction if her schemes are encouraged

#### Merchant Prince Rhaegar
**Role:** Dangerous Wildcard / Covenant Agent

**Description:** A heavyset man with a jovial smile, multiple gold rings, and the tan of someone who spends time at sea. His mask is a golden sun, and his laugh booms across the room. Behind the friendly facade lurk the eyes of a shark.

**Personality:** Ruthlessly pragmatic. He serves whatever power benefits him most. Currently that's the Covenant, but he would change allegiance for the right price.

**What They Want:** The Shard of Shadow--his Covenant superiors have demanded it

**Attitude Toward Party:** Will ignore them unless they interfere with his acquisition; if they do, he'll have his hidden bodyguards (2 **Veterans**) eliminate them

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: Lord Aldric Valerius
**Role:** The Silver Mask / Voice of Gold / Covenant Financier

**Description:** A handsome man in his late forties with silver-touched dark hair swept back from a patrician face. His eyes are warm brown--until the mask slips, revealing something cold and ancient behind them. He wears immaculate formal attire in silver and black, and his silver mask, filigreed with gold, is worked in the shape of a composed, smiling face. His signet ring--a coiled serpent eating its tail--never leaves his finger.

**Personality:** Publicly charming, generous, and cultured--the perfect host. Privately cold, calculating, and absolutely devoted to [[The Shackled God]]. He believes he is building a better world, that the current order is corrupt and must be swept away. He views casualties as necessary sacrifices for the greater good.

**Motivation:** Complete his life's work: fund the breaking of the seals and usher in the new age. The auction represents his final major operation before relocating to safety.

**Methods:**
- Misdirection and charm as first defense
- Blackmail files on many guests to ensure loyalty
- Paid guards and bound magical servants
- If cornered, he partially channels shadow power granted by a Shard he keeps on his person

**Weakness:**
- His arrogance: he genuinely believes he cannot be caught
- His attachment to trophies: he can't bring himself to destroy evidence of his "victories"
- His transformation is unstable: channeling shadow power damages him over time

**Combat Notes:**
- Uses **Warlock (Fiend)** stat block, CR 5
- **Eldritch Blast:** +7 to hit, 2d10+4 force damage (two beams)
- **Armor of Shadows:** AC 15 without armor
- **Misty Step:** Bonus action teleport 30 feet
- **Shadow Shard Transformation:** As a reaction when reduced below half HP, gains resistance to nonmagical weapons, +2 AC, and Darkvision 120 ft., but takes 1d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of his turns

#### Secondary Antagonist: Captain Mira Thorne
**Role:** Head of Valerius's Security / Veteran Soldier

**Description:** A powerfully built woman with close-cropped grey hair, a scarred face, and the bearing of a career soldier. She wears formal armor polished to mirror brightness and carries a longsword at her hip. Her mask is a steel wolf.

**Personality:** Professional, observant, and completely loyal to Lord Valerius--not from ideology but from the debt she owes him. He saved her family from debtor's prison ten years ago.

**Connection to Primary:** His most trusted protector; she knows he has secrets but deliberately doesn't ask. If confronted with evidence of his crimes, she will be shaken but will continue to fight--her honor demands it.

**Combat Notes:**
- Uses **Veteran** stat block (CR 3)
- Will prioritize protecting Valerius over engaging the party
- Can call 1d4 **Guards** as reinforcements each round for 3 rounds

## Encounters

### Combat Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Animated Sentinels
**Location:** Private Wing Corridor

**Trigger:** Any creature without Valerius's ring enters the corridor, or any aggressive action is taken

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Animated Armor | 2 | AC 18, HP 33, immune to poison and psychic |

**Tactics:** The armor fights silently and relentlessly. One engages intruders while the other attempts to bar the exit. They do not pursue beyond the private wing.

**Difficulty:** Medium (440 XP)

**Terrain Features:**
- Narrow corridor (10 feet wide)
- Decorative suits of armor along walls (potential cover, or confusion about which are animated)
- Heavy doors at each end (can be barred)

**Rewards:**
- Clear access to the Study

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Invisible Stalker | 1 | AC 14, HP 104, invisible, attacks with surprise |
| Guard | 2 | AC 16, HP 11, visible |

**Tactics:** The Invisible Stalker waits until combat begins, then targets spellcasters. The guards raise the alarm and fight defensively until reinforcements arrive.

**Difficulty:** Hard (2,100 XP)

**Terrain Features:**
- Display cases (half cover, DC 12 Strength to push over, 2d6 piercing damage in 5-foot area)
- Chairs (difficult terrain if scattered)
- Curtained windows (can be used to escape, 20-foot drop)

**Rewards:**
- Access to auction artifacts
- Opportunity to expose the auction publicly

#### Boss Encounter: The Ballroom Battle
**Location:** Grand Ballroom

**Setup:** Lord Valerius, cornered and exposed (or having discovered the theft), reveals his true nature. His silver mask cracks as shadow tendrils erupt from beneath his formal attire. His eyes go completely black. "You think yourselves heroes? You are insects crawling across the face of inevitability. The Truth cannot be unveiled by such as you--but you will see it. Oh yes. Before you die, you will see."

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Lord Aldric Valerius | 1 | CR 5 Warlock with Shadow Transformation |
| Captain Mira Thorne | 1 | CR 3 Veteran, fights to defend employer |
| Animated Armor | 2 | CR 1, decorative armor comes to life |
| Guard | 4 | CR 1/8, conflicted about fighting |

**Phases/Tactics:**

1. **Phase 1 (100% - 50% HP):** Valerius fights from range, using Eldritch Blast and Misty Step to maintain distance. Captain Thorne engages the greatest melee threat. Guards attempt to clear civilians and surround the party.

2. **Phase 2 (Below 50% HP):** Valerius activates his Shadow Shard Transformation. His AC increases, he gains resistance to nonmagical weapons, but he becomes more erratic--targeting whoever hurt him most rather than fighting tactically. The Animated Armor suits on display come to life and join the battle.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:**

Valerius has 3 Legendary Actions:
- **Shadow Step (1 action):** Teleport up to 30 feet to a space in dim light or darkness
- **Whisper of Doubt (2 actions):** One creature within 30 feet must make DC 14 Wisdom save or be frightened until end of its next turn
- **Eldritch Barrage (3 actions):** Make one Eldritch Blast attack

**Environmental Hazards:**
- **The Chandelier:** Can be dropped with a ranged attack (AC 12) or by cutting the chain (DC 15 Athletics). 10d6 bludgeoning damage in 20-foot radius, DC 15 Dexterity save for half. Creates difficult terrain.
- **Panicked Crowd:** 100+ nobles screaming and fleeing. Moving through crowd spaces requires DC 12 Athletics or Acrobatics or treat as difficult terrain.
- **Burning Curtains:** If fire magic is used, curtains catch fire within 1 round, spreading smoke (lightly obscured) throughout the room after 3 rounds.

**Victory Conditions:**
- Valerius is killed or incapacitated AND
- The party escapes with the Ledger OR
- The party survives until Grey Warden reinforcements arrive (10 rounds after combat begins)

**Rewards:**
- **The Black Ledger:** Quest item, evidence of Covenant operations
- **Valerius's Signet Ring:** Worth 500 gp; functions as a key to his vault
- **Cloak of Elvenkind:** Worn by Valerius (advantage on Stealth checks)
- **Shard of Shadow:** Dark artifact; dangerous to possess but valuable to researchers or enemies of the Covenant
- **Captain Thorne's Longsword:** +1 Longsword if she is defeated

### Social Encounters

#### The Mingling Hour
**Location:** Grand Ballroom (Pre-dinner)

**NPCs Present:** 100+ masked nobles, servants, guards, Lord Valerius (briefly), Countess Iona, Merchant Prince Rhaegar, Captain Thorne (observing)

**Stakes:** The party must gather intelligence and maintain their cover identities

**Information Available:**
- Guard patrol schedules
- Location of the Private Gallery
- Rumors about Valerius's "special guests"
- Identification of Covenant cell leaders (DC 18 Insight to spot recognition signals)
- Location of the Study (from a talkative servant)

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Charisma (Deception) | 13 | Maintain cover identity | Suspicious noble alerts guards |
| Charisma (Persuasion) | 14 | Charm information from a guard | Guard becomes suspicious, watches party |
| Wisdom (Insight) | 15 | Identify Covenant recognition signals | Misidentify an innocent noble |
| Intelligence (Investigation) | 14 | Spot servant passage entrance | Waste time in wrong area |
| Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) | 16 | Pickpocket a guest's invitation to Private Gallery | Get caught; immediate confrontation |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- **Best:** Party learns vault location, guard schedules, and identifies a cell leader without raising suspicion
- **Moderate:** Party learns some information but attracts attention; future checks made at disadvantage
- **Worst:** Party's cover is blown early; must abandon the social approach and improvise

#### The Dinner Confrontation
**Location:** Formal Dining Room

**NPCs Present:** 60 seated nobles, including party, Countess Iona, Merchant Prince Rhaegar, Lord Valerius (head of table)

**Stakes:** Survive seven courses of pointed questions and noble intrigue without blowing cover

**Information Available:**
- Valerius's departure plans (he mentions "traveling east" soon)
- Countess Iona's obsession with the Tears of Midnight
- Rhaegar's interest in "historical artifacts"
- Hints that the entertainment was not hired willingly

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Charisma (Deception) | 14 | Answer probing questions about cover identity | Contradictions noted; disadvantage on future Deception |
| Intelligence (History) | 13 | Demonstrate knowledge of "home region" | Cover identity weakens |
| Charisma (Performance) | 12 | Fit in with noble dining etiquette | Minor faux pas; snide comments but no exposure |
| Wisdom (Perception) | 15 | Notice Valerius checking his pocket watch | Clue: something important happens on a schedule |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- **Best:** Party survives dinner with cover intact and gains key intelligence
- **Moderate:** Minor suspicions raised; guards assigned to "assist" the party
- **Worst:** Lord Valerius personally questions a party member; DC 16 Deception or early exposure

### Exploration Challenges

#### The Hedge Maze Escape
**Location:** Manor Gardens

**Description:** A ornamental hedge maze covering half an acre between the manor and the river dock. In daylight, a pleasant diversion. At night, during a pursuit, a confusing labyrinth of 8-foot hedges.

**Skills Useful:**
- Survival (DC 13) to track path to the dock
- Nature (DC 12) to identify thinner sections of hedge
- Athletics (DC 14) to force through hedges (noisy, leaves trail)
- Perception (DC 15) to spot pursuing guards' lanterns

**Hazards:**
- Dead ends that waste time
- Guards know the maze; they gain advantage on pursuit checks
- Hidden garden pool (DC 12 Perception or fall in, alerting pursuers)

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:**
- Shortcut to dock (saves 2 rounds)
- Gardener's shed with spare servant uniforms (potential disguise)
- Clear line of sight to Lady Kaelen's signal lantern

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Vault is in the Study | Mingling Hour | Charm a servant (DC 14 Persuasion) | Study location |
| Ring is the key | Dinner | Overhear guests discussing Valerius's "never-removed ring" | How to open vault |
| Constellation puzzle | Study desk | Decode correspondence (DC 16 Intelligence) | Vault combination |
| Auction at midnight | Public knowledge | Announced by Valerius | Timing for heist |
| Cell leader signals | Mingling Hour | DC 18 Insight to spot | Secondary objective |
| Brother's remains | Cellar | Follow suspicious servant (DC 15 Perception) | Hidden objective |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. **The Wine Merchant:** A guest behaves suspiciously, constantly checking his pocket. He's actually having an affair with another guest's wife and is waiting for a signal to meet. Not Covenant-related.
2. **The Strange Servant:** A servant seems terrified and keeps watching Valerius. She's not a prisoner--she accidentally broke a valuable vase and fears discovery. Not a plot element.
3. **The Eastern Wing:** Locked and apparently important. Actually just closed for renovations; nothing valuable inside.

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The vault contains not just the Ledger but Lady Kaelen's brother's Grey Warden cloak and other trophies of Valerius's victims.

**When It's Revealed:** When the party opens the vault and examines its contents.

**Impact:** Transforms the mission from abstract justice to personal vengeance for their ally. Raises the stakes for returning evidence to Lady Kaelen. Also reveals the scope of Valerius's crimes--he's killed before and will kill again.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Glyph of Warding | Study door | Opening without speaking password | Thunder burst | 15 Dex | 5d8 thunder |
| Poison Needle | Vault blood slot | Pricking finger | Poison (1 minute paralysis) | 14 Con | 2d6 poison |
| Alarm Ward | All display cases | Touching case | Silent alarm to guards | - | Alert only |
| Collapsing Passage | Servant tunnels (one section) | Pressure plate | Ceiling collapse | 14 Dex | 4d6 bludgeoning |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Panicked Crowd | Ballroom (combat) | Difficult terrain, possible trampling (1d6 bludgeoning/round if prone in crowd) | Clear area, crowd control, or ignore |
| Fallen Chandelier | Ballroom | Difficult terrain, dim light in area | Navigate around |
| Smoke from Fire | Ballroom (if fire used) | Lightly obscured after 3 rounds, heavily obscured after 6 | Windows, magic, leave area |
| River Current | Dock area | DC 12 Athletics to swim, DC 8 to board boat | Use dock ladder, rope |

### Puzzles

#### The Constellation Lock
**Location:** Valerius's vault

**Description:** Three concentric rings of bronze, each covered in astronomical symbols, must be rotated to align and form a specific constellation. The outer ring shows stars, the middle ring shows connecting lines, the inner ring shows a symbol. Currently, they display random positions.

**Solution:**
- The correct constellation is "The Prisoner"--a figure with arms raised, bound by chains
- Clues in Valerius's desk correspondence reference "the shape of our master"
- DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) to recognize the constellation from fragments
- DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) to solve through trial and error (takes 10 minutes, may attract attention)

**Hints:**
- A book on Valerius's shelf, "Star Myths of the Ancient World," has a bookmark at the relevant page
- The correspondence mentions "aligning with the truth"
- A successful DC 20 Arcana check recognizes the constellation immediately

**Bypass Options:**
- Knock spell (opens the vault but triggers a silent alarm)
- DC 22 Thieves' Tools (takes 1 minute, triggers alarm on failure)
- Valerius's backup ring in the painting compartment
- Force: DC 25 Strength, creates noise audible throughout the floor

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| How to enter the ball | Front door with invitations / Sneak via servants | Front door: social challenges. Servants: immediate stealth challenges. |
| When to attempt the heist | Before auction / During auction / After auction | Before: less security but Valerius present. During: distracted guards but alert guests. After: high alert, limited time. |
| What to take from vault | Just the Ledger / Everything / Ledger + remains | Speed vs. evidence vs. emotional reward for Kaelen |
| How to confront Valerius | Public exposure / Private capture / Silent escape | Public: dramatic but dangerous. Private: safer but no witnesses. Silent: clean but he remains free. |
| The Shard of Shadow | Destroy it / Keep it / Let it be sold | Destroy: removes threat. Keep: dangerous power. Sell: Covenant gains asset. |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Avoid all social interaction, enter via servant passages, complete heist without anyone knowing they were there
- **Diplomacy:** Work the social scene so effectively that a sympathetic noble helps them access the private wing
- **Brute Force:** Crash the party, fight through guards, grab the Ledger, and escape (works but creates maximum enemies)
- **Deception:** Convince Valerius himself to show them the vault (extremely difficult but possible)
- **Long Con:** Spend multiple days establishing cover, earning an invitation to the auction, and betraying Valerius from inside

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- **Captured:** The party wakes in Valerius's cellar, stripped of equipment. Escape becomes a dungeon crawl through the Undercroft connecting to [[Highwall]]'s secret passages.
- **Exposed Early:** The heist becomes a running battle through the manor. The Ledger can still be obtained but escape is harder.
- **Valerius Escapes:** The adventure continues as a chase to the docks, then potentially across water if he reaches his ship.
- **Party Split:** Some captured, some free. Free members must rescue captured companions while maintaining the mission.
- **Total Party Kill:** Unlikely but possible. Surviving characters wake as prisoners; dead characters may be raised by Grey Warden allies if the body is recovered.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:**
- Grey Warden agents secure Valerius Manor
- Commander Kaelen arrives with garrison troops to "restore order"
- The party is escorted to safety before questions are asked publicly
- Within a week, arrests begin across [[Highwall]] based on Ledger evidence
- Lord Valerius's assets are frozen pending investigation
- The party is quietly celebrated as heroes; loudly ignored by officials embarrassed by the corruption

**If Failed:**
- The party is branded criminals: "foreign agents who attacked a noble's celebration"
- Wanted posters appear within days
- The Grey Wardens go underground to avoid association
- Valerius departs by ship, destroying evidence
- The party must flee [[Highwall]] and cannot return without disguise
- Act 2 begins with the party as fugitives seeking redemption

**If Partial Success:**
- Valerius is dead but evidence is incomplete
- Some arrests occur but key figures escape
- The party's reputation is mixed: heroes to some, vigilantes to others
- The Grey Wardens maintain distance publicly but assist privately

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- The Covenant knows the party by name and face--they become priority targets
- The power vacuum in Covenant finances causes internal conflict, slowing operations by months
- [[The Whisperwood]] becomes the next theater of conflict as "Project Corruption" is investigated
- Political upheaval in [[Highwall]] as Valerius's allies scramble to distance themselves
- The [[Shard of Shadow]] (if recovered) becomes a plot point--researchers want to study it, Covenant wants it back

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. **Project Corruption:** The Ledger references major Covenant operations in [[The Whisperwood]]--the hook for [[Shadows in the Wood]]
2. **The Other Auction Participants:** Merchant Prince Rhaegar escaped; what will he do with his Covenant connections?
3. **The Infiltrated Council:** The Ledger hints at corruption in [[Rivergard]]'s Gilded Council--a thread for much later
4. **Countess Iona's Obsession:** If she obtained the Tears of Midnight, what will she do with them?
5. **The Remaining Cell Leaders:** At least two escaped the manor--they will appear in future adventures

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Lord Valerius | Dead or imprisoned; assets seized | Escaped; plots revenge |
| Lady Kaelen | Promoted within Grey Wardens; becomes recurring ally | Goes underground; bitter but still allied |
| Captain Thorne | Arrested (if alive) or dead; may later seek redemption | Remains Valerius's enforcer; recurring enemy |
| Countess Iona | Arrested or fled, depending on her auction activities | Escaped with or without her prize |
| Merchant Prince Rhaegar | Fled; under investigation | Fled; position strengthened in Covenant |
| Commander Kaelen | Embarrassed but grateful; owes party a favor | Hunting the party as criminals |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- **Emphasize the Masks:** Everyone wears a literal mask; use this to hide identities and create paranoia. Even allies might be enemies in disguise.
- **Track Time:** Create a simple timeline: arrival (7 PM), mingling (7-8 PM), dinner (8-10 PM), dancing (10-12 AM), auction (12-2 AM). Let players feel time pressure.
- **Play the Social Game:** The heist is actually the easy part. The real challenge is navigating noble society without blowing cover.
- **Make Valerius Charming:** Until his reveal, he should be likeable. The best villains believe they're heroes.
- **Have Backup Plans:** If players do something unexpected, Valerius is smart--he has contingencies. If they're too successful, escalate; if they're struggling, offer opportunities.

### Pacing Suggestions
- **Session 1:** The hook (Lady Kaelen), arrival at the manor, the mingling hour, dinner. End on a cliffhanger--the auction is about to begin.
- **Session 2:** The heist, discovery, confrontation, and climax. Should feel increasingly tense until the explosive finale.
- If running as a one-shot, compress social scenes and skip to the heist after brief roleplay.

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to kill Valerius immediately | Guards intervene; social consequences; possible combat; mission becomes much harder |
| Refuse to attend the ball | Lady Kaelen is disappointed but offers alternatives (servant disguises, later break-in); less intel available |
| Ally with Countess Iona | She can provide distraction but will betray party if it benefits her |
| Get caught early | Valerius has them "escorted out" first (to avoid scandal); guards take them to cellar instead |
| Set fire to the manor | Chaos ensues; innocents at risk; evidence may be destroyed; authorities hostile |
| Try to warn Commander Kaelen | He investigates officially, spooking Valerius; evidence destroyed before party can act |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties:**
- Reduce Animated Armor to 1 in corridor, 1 in ballroom
- Remove the Invisible Stalker from the Gallery
- Valerius does not transform (standard Warlock stat block)
- Captain Thorne surrenders if Valerius falls

**For Stronger Parties:**
- Add a third Animated Armor to the corridor
- Valerius has cast *mage armor* already (AC 18 until transformation)
- Add a **Shadow Demon** that emerges when Valerius transforms
- Captain Thorne has a **Potion of Heroism** active (10 temporary HP, +1d4 to attacks and saves)

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- Mention "strange blight" in the Whisperwood during dinner conversation
- A guest mentions "troubles in the mountains"--orc activity increasing
- The Ledger contains references to the "First Seal" and "Citadel operations"
- Valerius, if he speaks before dying, whispers "The chains grow light... you're too late..."

## Secrets

1. **Lady Kaelen's Hidden Motive:** She hopes the party will kill Valerius, not just expose him. She wants revenge for her brother and knows a trial might fail. She won't admit this unless directly confronted.

2. **The Backup Escape:** Valerius has a *teleportation circle* in his study that connects to a safehouse in [[Rivergard]]. If reduced to critical HP and able to reach the study, he will attempt to flee this way.

3. **Commander Kaelen's Awareness:** Lady Kaelen's uncle actually knows about this mission but is maintaining plausible deniability. If the party is captured, he will arrange their "escape" if possible.

4. **The Entertainer's Secret:** The musicians at the ball are prisoners--[[Black Lotus]] operatives who were captured and forced to perform. They would help the party if freed, providing information about servant passages.

5. **The Real Voice of Gold:** Valerius isn't the only Voice of Gold candidate. [[The Nightmaster]] in [[Rivergard]] also claims the title. The Covenant has two financial arms, and they don't trust each other.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. **From [[Ruins of the Dawn]]:** The party recovered the Dawn Key and evidence pointing to Lord Valerius's involvement with the Covenant.
2. **From [[Riverboat to Highwall]]:** The murder mystery aboard the Gilded Swan revealed one victim was carrying an invitation to Valerius's ball.
3. **Independent Hook:** The party has heard rumors of a corrupt noble in Highwall and seeks to investigate.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **[[Shadows in the Wood]]:** The Ledger reveals "Project Corruption" threatening the [[Whisperwood]]--the Grey Wardens need help investigating.
2. **The Fleeing Merchant:** Merchant Prince Rhaegar escaped with Covenant intelligence; tracking him could disrupt their operations further.
3. **Clearing Their Names:** If the party failed, they must prove their innocence or live as fugitives.
4. **The Tears of Midnight:** If Countess Iona obtained the cursed necklace, her daughter's "resurrection" may cause problems requiring the party's intervention.
5. **Debts Come Due:** Captain Thorne, if she survived and was imprisoned, knows secrets she might trade for freedom--or revenge.

**Prompt:**
> The Grand Ballroom of Valerius Manor transformed into a battlefield. The great crystal chandelier lies shattered on the marble floor, candles still guttering among the wreckage. Lord Valerius stands at the center of the destruction, his formal attire torn to reveal tendrils of living shadow erupting from his body. His silver mask has cracked in half, revealing one eye consumed entirely by darkness. His hands crackle with eldritch energy as he faces the party of adventurers. Behind him, two suits of decorative armor have come to life and advance on the heroes. Panicked nobles in torn masquerade costumes flee toward the exits while guards in formal uniforms hesitate, uncertain whose side to take. Moonlight streams through tall windows, mixing with the dying candlelight. The atmosphere is chaos, betrayal, and supernatural horror unleashed in a place of beauty.

## Notes
Additional details, inspiration sources, and design notes:
- Inspired by heist films (Ocean's Eleven, Mission Impossible) combined with Gothic horror (Crimson Peak, Phantom of the Opera)
- The social mechanics should feel tense--encourage players to stay in character and roleplay their cover identities
- Valerius is designed as a memorable villain: charismatic until his mask (literal and figurative) comes off
- The transformation is deliberately unstable--it's not a power-up, it's a desperate gambit that's killing him
- Lady Kaelen may become a recurring patron if the party earns her trust
- Commander Kaelen's relationship to Lady Kaelen creates interesting tension with the garrison town's leadership
- The adventure deliberately ends Act 1 with a bang and sets up the wider scope of Act 2
