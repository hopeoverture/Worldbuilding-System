> Reality breaking down immediately before the final boss.

## Overview
After disabling the Lodestones, the party moves toward the Antechamber. But the barrier didn't just fall; it shattered. Fragments of the **Far Realm** are leaking in. The hallway itself is alive and hostile.

## Classification
**Adventure Type:** Environmental Hazard
**Tone:** Surreal Horror

## The Hook
The corridor ahead stretches infinitely, then snaps back. Gravity is sideways.

## Objectives
### Primary Objective
Reach the door at the end of the hall.

## Structure
### Act 1: The Geometry
A puzzle where "Down" changes every round.

### Act 2: The Denizens
**Gibbering Mouthers** and **Star Spawn** manifest from the walls.

## Rewards
- **Restoration:** A pool of pure light exists in the chaos, acting as a "Long Rest" point before the final battle (essential for balance).

## Image Prompts
**Prompt:**
**A hallway in the Obsidian Fortress where physics has failed. Floating debris. Purple nebulae visible through cracks in reality. Star Spawn emerging from non-euclidean angles. Surreal.**

## Connections
- **Connects to:** [[The Obsidian Gate]] (Transition) -> [[Echoes of the First Shadow]] (Finale)
