# The Whispering Caves

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
The small village of [[Oakhaven]] is plagued by disappearances, including the mayor's young son Timmy, blamed on a local goblin tribe that has recently turned uncharacteristically aggressive. The party must venture into the abandoned [[Old Echo Mine]], investigating the source of the goblins' sudden madness. Deep within the lightless tunnels, they will uncover that the [[Blacktooth Goblins]] have been corrupted by a [[Shard of Shadow]], a fragment of the Imprisoned's power, marking the first ominous sign of an ancient evil's return. This is a campaign-opening adventure designed to introduce new players to the world of [[Valdoria]] while establishing the seeds of a greater threat.

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 2-3 Sessions

**Party Level:** 1

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate

**Combat Frequency:** High

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Low

**Exploration Emphasis:** Moderate

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party arrives in [[Oakhaven]] to find the village in distress; boarded windows, barred doors, and fearful whispers dominate the atmosphere. The village alarm bell rings as a goblin scouting party attacks the gates. After helping repel the attack, the party is approached by [[Mayor Haldor]], who is desperate for help after the local militia failed to return from searching for his missing son, Timmy.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Mayor Haldor]]
**Motivation:** Rescue his son Timmy and stop the goblin raids that threaten to destroy his village.
**What They Offer:** 50 gold pieces (a fortune for the small village), free lodging at The Golden Tankard, and the eternal gratitude of [[Oakhaven]].

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The [[Blacktooth Goblins]] were once a nuisance but peaceful traders who exchanged mushrooms and cave moss for trinkets; now they kill on sight with unnatural ferocity.
- Strange "whispers" have been heard echoing from the valley leading to the mine, audible even from the village on quiet nights.
- The [[Old Echo Mine]] was abandoned a century ago due to "bad air" and cave-ins; locals consider it cursed.
- Three militia members went to investigate four days ago and never returned.
- The goblins took Timmy three days ago during a night raid.

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate

**Consequences of Delay:** Each day of delay, one captive is sacrificed to the Shard. Timmy is scheduled to be the final sacrifice in two days. If the party delays more than three days, all captives die and the Shard's corruption spreads further.

## Background

### The Situation
A minor earth tremor caused by the weakening seals of the Imprisoned cracked open a geode in the deep mines, revealing a [[Shard of Shadow]]—a crystallized fragment of pure shadow magic connected to the ancient evil. The [[Blacktooth Goblins]] found it during a routine foraging expedition, and its malevolent influence drove them into a murderous frenzy, twisting their bodies and minds. Their chieftain, [[Groz]], was the first to touch the Shard directly and has been utterly consumed by its power. He now believes the whispers from the Shard are the voice of a "New God" who demands blood sacrifices to complete his awakening.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- **One month ago:** A tremor originating from deep beneath the [[Wraithmoor Marshes]] cracks open a sealed geode in the [[Old Echo Mine]].
- **Three weeks ago:** The [[Blacktooth Goblins]] discover the Shard during a mushroom harvest; several goblins go mad instantly.
- **Two weeks ago:** [[Groz]], investigating the disturbance, touches the Shard and is corrupted. He proclaims himself Prophet of the Whispering God.
- **One week ago:** The corrupted tribe begins raiding [[Oakhaven]], taking prisoners instead of trading goods.
- **Four days ago:** Three militia members pursue the goblins and are captured.
- **Three days ago:** Timmy is taken during a night raid on the village outskirts.
- **Present:** The party arrives as another raid begins.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Groz]] (Goblin Boss) | Serve the "Whispering God" and complete the awakening ritual | Sacrifice villagers to the Shard, spreading its corruption |
| Timmy (Captive) | Survive and escape | Hide, stay quiet, and wait for rescue |
| [[Mayor Haldor]] | Save his son and protect the village | Hire adventurers, offer everything he has |
| Militia Survivors | Escape captivity | Provide information to rescuers, fight if freed |
| The Shard (Entity) | Spread corruption and weaken seals | Whisper commands, enhance worshippers |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** The village is saved, Timmy returns home safely, the militia survivors are rescued, and the Shard is contained or destroyed. [[Oakhaven]] becomes a safe haven and the party gains allies for future adventures.

**If the party fails:** [[Oakhaven]] is slowly depopulated as raids continue. The Shard's influence spreads, creating a zone of shadow corruption. The [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] takes interest in the growing darkness, potentially accelerating their plans.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Rescue the captives (Timmy and 2 surviving militia members) from the [[Old Echo Mine]] and return them safely to [[Oakhaven]].

### Secondary Objectives
Optional goals that enhance the adventure:
1. Eliminate the goblin threat by defeating [[Groz]] and dispersing the tribe.
2. Discover the source of the goblins' madness and corruption.
3. Recover any valuables or supplies the goblins have stolen from the village.

### Hidden Objectives
Goals the party may discover during play:
1. Recover the [[Shard of Shadow]] for study or destruction (dangerous to transport).
2. Find the **Covenant Scroll** in Groz's possession, hinting at a larger conspiracy involving the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]].

### Success Conditions
How is victory defined?
- Timmy is returned alive to [[Mayor Haldor]].
- At least one militia member survives to tell of the horror.
- [[Groz]] is defeated and the immediate threat neutralized.

### Failure Conditions
How can the party fail?
- Timmy dies before rescue (sacrifice or combat).
- The entire party is killed or captured.
- The party retreats without rescuing any captives.

## Adventure Structure

### Act 1: Setup
**Goal:** Establish the situation, gather information, and reach the mine entrance.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **Arrival Under Siege:** The party arrives as goblins attack the village gates. They must help defend [[Oakhaven]] and prove their worth.
2. **The Grieving Father:** After the battle, [[Mayor Haldor]] approaches and pleads for help, offering everything he has. He explains the situation and provides what information he knows.
3. **Gathering Intel:** The party can speak with villagers at The Golden Tankard tavern, visit the Temple of the Lawgiver for blessings, and examine goblin corpses for clues.

**Information to Reveal:**
- The goblins' eyes are pitch black, unnaturally so (sign of shadow corruption).
- They carry strange obsidian daggers that seem to drink the light.
- The bodies smell of ozone and decay, not normal goblin musk.
- An elderly miner named Old Varric knows the mine layout from his youth.

**Transition to Act 2:** Following the goblin tracks or using Old Varric's directions, the party travels 3 miles north through the canyon to the mine entrance.

### Act 2: Confrontation
**Goal:** Navigate the mine tunnels, overcome obstacles, and locate the goblin lair.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Echoing Tunnels:** The upper mine levels feature natural hazards (unstable floors, bad air pockets) and goblin traps (tripwires, rockfall triggers). The party must proceed carefully.
2. **The Whispering Gallery:** A natural acoustic chamber where whispers echo from below. Stealth is nearly impossible here, but listening reveals goblin patrol patterns.
3. **The Prison Pit:** A side chamber where two militia survivors (Bren and Kara) are caged. They reveal Timmy was taken deeper, to the "altar."
4. **The Shadow Skirmish:** Fighting corrupted goblins who can meld briefly with shadows, gaining advantage on attacks from darkness.

**Rising Tension:** The whispers grow louder as the party descends; torches flicker and dim unnaturally. Shadow seems to move at the edge of vision. The temperature drops noticeably.

**Midpoint Twist:** The goblins aren't eating the prisoners—they are "bleeding" them onto a dark crystal, draining their life force to power some kind of ritual. The blood flows toward the Shard.

**Transition to Act 3:** A carved tunnel, newer than the mine works, leads down to a natural cavern where violet light pulses. The final confrontation awaits.

### Act 3: Resolution
**Goal:** Confront [[Groz]], defeat him, and rescue Timmy before the ritual completes.

**Key Scenes:**
1. **The Ritual Chamber:** [[Groz]] stands atop a rough stone dais, channeling energy from the [[Shard of Shadow]] into himself. Timmy is bound nearby, weakened but alive. Shadow tendrils writhe around the chamber.
2. **The Final Battle:** [[Groz]] and his bodyguards must be defeated while protecting Timmy from harm.
3. **The Escape:** Once Groz falls, the Shard's energy destabilizes. The mine begins to collapse as shadow magic dissipates. The party must flee with Timmy and any freed prisoners.

**Climactic Encounter:** Battle against [[Groz]] and his two Shadow-Touched Goblin Cutthroat bodyguards in the Ritual Chamber. The Shard provides Groz with enhanced abilities.

**Resolution Options:**
- **Destroy the Shard:** Smashing it releases a burst of necrotic energy (2d6 necrotic damage, DC 12 Constitution save for half) but ends the corruption permanently.
- **Contain the Shard:** A DC 14 Arcana check allows safe removal; failure triggers the necrotic burst. The Shard remains dangerous but valuable for study.
- **Leave the Shard:** The corruption will slowly return over months, requiring future intervention.

## Locations

### Overview Map
[[Oakhaven]] sits in a wooded valley at the foot of the [[Ironspine Mountains]]. The [[Old Echo Mine]] is 3 miles north, up a winding canyon path that follows an old cart track. The canyon narrows as it approaches the mine, creating natural chokepoints where goblins have set ambushes.

### Primary Location
**Name:** [[Old Echo Mine]]

**Description:** An abandoned silver mine dating back a century, now choked with spiderwebs, fungal growth, and the pervasive smell of ozone and decay. The upper levels are cramped tunnels supported by rotting timbers. The lower levels open into natural caverns where the goblins have made their lair. Strange violet light pulses from the deepest chamber.

**Key Features:**
- **The Entrance:** A stone archway carved with mining guild symbols, now covered in goblin warning totems made of bones and black feathers.
- **The Whispering Gallery:** A tunnel section with unusual acoustics that amplifies sound (creatures have disadvantage on Stealth checks; Perception checks to hear have advantage).
- **The Cart Track:** Rusted iron rails run through the upper tunnels. An intact mining cart can be used for a dynamic chase or combat encounter.
- **The Prison Pit:** A 10-foot deep natural depression with iron bars across the top, used to hold captives.
- **The Ritual Chamber:** A large natural cavern at the deepest point, where the [[Shard of Shadow]] rests on a stone dais.

**Encounters Here:** Goblin Sentries, Giant Spiders (wildlife disturbed by goblins), Shadow-Corrupted Bats, Goblin War Party, [[Groz]] and his Cutthroats.

### Location 2: Oakhaven
**Description:** A sleepy village of 200 souls built around lumber and mining industries, now gripped by terror. Buildings are sturdy timber construction with slate roofs. The village green is dominated by an old oak tree said to be blessed by nature spirits.

**Key Features:**
- **The Golden Tankard:** A cozy tavern and inn run by the cheerful but worried Marta. The party can rest here and gather rumors.
- **Temple of the Lawgiver:** A small stone temple dedicated to lawful deities. The priest, Father Aldric, can provide healing and blessings. This location becomes important in Adventure 2.
- **The Village Green:** Where the militia musters. Currently where goblin bodies are being burned.
- **Haldor's House:** The mayor's modest home on the village edge, where Timmy was taken from.

**Encounters Here:** Goblin Scout Raid (Act 1), potential Social Encounters with villagers.

### Location 3: The Canyon Path
**Description:** A winding trail through a narrow canyon leading from [[Oakhaven]] to the [[Old Echo Mine]]. Rocky walls rise 30-40 feet on either side, providing excellent ambush positions.

**Key Features:**
- **The Chokepoint:** A narrow section where only two can walk abreast—perfect for goblin ambushes.
- **The Rockslide:** A recent collapse partially blocks the path, requiring climbing (DC 10 Athletics) or finding an alternate route.
- **Goblin Markers:** Crude totems warn trespassers away, growing more numerous closer to the mine.

**Encounters Here:** Goblin Ambush, Environmental Hazards.

### Travel
| From | To | Distance | Hazards |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| Oakhaven | Canyon Chokepoint | 1 Mile | Goblin Scouts |
| Canyon Chokepoint | Old Echo Mine | 2 Miles | Goblin Ambush, Rockslide |
| Mine Entrance | Prison Pit | 0.5 Miles (underground) | Traps, Giant Spiders |
| Prison Pit | Ritual Chamber | 0.25 Miles (underground) | Shadow Goblins, Unstable Floors |

### Antagonists

#### Primary Antagonist: [[Groz]]
**Role:** Goblin Boss / Shadow Prophet

**Description:** Once a cunning but unremarkable goblin chieftain, Groz has been transformed by the [[Shard of Shadow]] into something terrible. He stands a head taller than normal goblins, his green skin marbled with black veins that pulse with dark energy. His left eye has been replaced by a jagged shard of obsidian that glows with violet light. Shadow clings to him like a living cloak.

**Personality:** Manic and obsessive, speaking in shifting voices that mimic the whispers from the Shard. He oscillates between cunning manipulation and savage rage. He genuinely believes he serves a god.

**Motivation:** Complete the ritual to "awaken the Stone" and become the chosen prophet of the Whispering God. He craves power and the validation the Shard's whispers provide.

**Methods:** Brute force combined with shadow magic. He sacrifices captives to the Shard, uses intimidation and religious fervor to control his tribe, and sends raiding parties to gather more victims.

**Weakness:** Bright light (such as the Light cantrip or a torch thrust in his face) stuns him for one round due to his shadow corruption. He is also overconfident, believing the Shard makes him invincible.

**Combat Notes:** Uses *Shadow Step* (bonus action, teleport 30 feet between shadows), has a necrotic damage aura (creatures starting turn within 5 feet take 2 necrotic damage), and can cast *Darkness* once per day. Stats as Goblin Boss with +10 HP and the above abilities.

#### Secondary Antagonist: Shadow-Touched Cutthroats
**Role:** Elite Bodyguards

**Description:** Two goblins who have been partially transformed by proximity to the Shard. Their skin has darkened to a deep gray-green, and their movements are unnaturally fluid, as if they slip between shadows.

**Connection to Primary:** Groz's most faithful followers, granted power by the Shard in exchange for absolute loyalty.

## Encounters

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Goblin | 4 | Corrupted, fight to the death |
| Worg | 1 | Shadow-scarred, black foam on muzzle |

**Tactics:** The Worg charges the strongest-looking defender while goblins flank and use pack tactics. They fight to the death rather than retreating (unusual for goblins, a clue to their corruption).

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Terrain Features:** Wooden palisade provides half cover; torches can be grabbed as improvised weapons; the village well provides difficult terrain.

**Rewards:** 5 gp in mixed coins, 4 Obsidian Daggers (worth 10 gp total, radiate faint necromancy), crude map of canyon path.

#### Encounter 2: Canyon Ambush
**Location:** The Chokepoint in the Canyon Path

**Trigger:** Party travels through the narrow section of the canyon.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Goblin | 3 | Archers on ledges above |
| Goblin | 2 | Melee blockers in the path |

**Tactics:** Archers fire from 30-foot ledges (three-quarters cover) while melee goblins block retreat. If two melee goblins fall, archers flee to warn the mine.

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Terrain Features:** Narrow path (difficult terrain for more than single file), 30-foot cliffs (DC 15 Athletics to climb), loose rocks for improvised weapons.

**Rewards:** 8 gp, shortbow with 20 arrows, leather armor.

#### Encounter 3: Spider Nest
**Location:** Side tunnel in Upper Mines

**Trigger:** Party investigates strange webbing or makes loud noise.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Giant Wolf Spider | 2 | Nest disturbed by goblins |

**Tactics:** Spiders use webs and walls to gain advantage, attempting to isolate and drag away smaller targets.

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Terrain Features:** Thick webbing (difficult terrain), cocoons containing goblin corpses and 15 gp, ceiling is 10 feet high.

**Rewards:** 15 gp from cocoons, spider silk worth 5 gp if harvested.

**Location:** Lower Mine Tunnels

**Trigger:** Party approaches the Prison Pit.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Shadow-Touched Goblin | 3 | Can Hide as bonus action in dim light |

**Tactics:** Use hit-and-run tactics, striking from darkness then melting back into shadows. Will attempt to raise alarm if outmatched.

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Terrain Features:** Dim light only (torches flicker unnaturally), multiple tunnel intersections, a minecart that can be pushed as an improvised attack.

**Rewards:** 12 gp, key to Prison Pit cage, crude drawing showing the ritual chamber layout.

#### Boss Encounter: The Shadow Ritual
**Location:** The Ritual Chamber (Deep Mine Cavern)

**Setup:** [[Groz]] stands atop a 5-foot high stone dais, arms raised as violet energy streams from the [[Shard of Shadow]] into his body. Timmy is bound to a stone pillar 10 feet from the dais, pale and barely conscious. Two Shadow-Touched Cutthroats guard the chamber entrance. The cavern is 40 feet in diameter with a 20-foot ceiling.

**Enemies:**
| Creature | Number | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| [[Groz]] | 1 | Enhanced Goblin Boss (see Antagonists) |
| Shadow-Touched Cutthroat | 2 | Goblin stats + Shadow Step |

**Phases/Tactics:**
1. **Phase 1 (100%-50% HP):** Groz commands his Cutthroats to attack while he continues channeling. He uses his necrotic aura and casts Darkness if the party uses bright light. He taunts the party, claiming the Whispering God will consume them all.
2. **Phase 2 (Below 50% HP):** Groz abandons the ritual and engages directly, using Shadow Step aggressively to reach spellcasters or wounded targets. He becomes more erratic, his multiple voices arguing with each other.

**Lair Actions/Legendary Actions:** On initiative count 20, shadow tendrils lash out from the Shard. One random party member must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity save or take 1d6 necrotic damage and be restrained until the end of their next turn.

**Victory Conditions:** Groz is defeated and Timmy is freed alive.

**Rewards:** [[Shard of Shadow]] (dangerous artifact), Groz's Loot Stash (200 gp, *Ring of Protection*), Covenant Scroll (plot item), Groz's Obsidian Eye (worth 50 gp, faintly magical).

### Social Encounters

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Party gains full support, extra gold, detailed information, and Old Varric's secret entrance.
- Moderate: Party gains standard support and information.
- Worst: Party refuses or demands too much; must find the mine alone with minimal supplies.

#### Interrogating the Wounded

**Stakes:** Information about the mine layout and Groz's plans.

**Information Available:**
- Groz's location and the ritual
- Number of goblins remaining
- The Shard's influence and how to resist it

**Skill Challenges:**
| Skill | DC | Success | Failure |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| Intimidation | 12 | Goblin reveals Groz's location | Goblin laughs maniacally |
| Persuasion | 15 | Goblin shares that "the stone" controls them | Refuses to betray "god" |
| Medicine | 14 | Realize the corruption is magical, not disease | Assume natural madness |

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Best: Full tactical information about the mine and Groz's weaknesses.
- Moderate: Partial information about goblin numbers and general layout.
- Worst: Goblin dies or escapes; no information gained.

### Exploration Challenges

#### The Unstable Tunnels
**Location:** Upper Mine Levels

**Description:** A century of neglect has left the mine supports rotting and unstable. Careless movement could trigger collapses.

**Skills Useful:** Perception (spot weak spots), Investigation (find safe paths), Athletics (brace supports), Survival (navigate by air currents)

**Hazards:**
- **Collapsing Floor:** DC 12 Dexterity save or fall 10 feet into a lower tunnel (1d6 bludgeoning)
- **Bad Air Pocket:** DC 10 Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 hour
- **Rockfall:** Loud noises trigger DC 13 Dexterity save or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:** Old mining equipment worth 20 gp, a forgotten miner's journal describing the original discovery of "strange crystals," a shortcut that bypasses Encounter 3.

#### The Ventilation Shaft
**Location:** Hidden entrance to the mine (if Old Varric provides information)

**Description:** A narrow vertical shaft used to ventilate the deep tunnels. It emerges near the Prison Pit, bypassing the upper mine hazards.

**Skills Useful:** Athletics (climb 60 feet), Stealth (enter undetected), Perception (spot goblin patrols below)

**Hazards:**
- **The Climb:** DC 10 Athletics check; failure means falling (6d6 bludgeoning damage, or half with a successful DC 15 Dexterity save to catch a handhold)
- **Bats:** Shadow-corrupted bats nest here; disturbing them alerts nearby goblins

**Rewards for Thorough Exploration:** Surprise advantage on Encounter 4, ability to free prisoners before boss fight, tactical positioning.

## Clues & Information

### Information Flow
What players need to learn and when:

| Clue | Location | Method | Leads To |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Black eyes, obsidian daggers | Village attack | Observation | Unnatural corruption |
| Goblins were once peaceful | Mayor Haldor | Conversation | Something changed them |
| Mine has "bad air" | Village rumors | Conversation | Caution in exploration |
| Detailed mine layout | Old Varric | Conversation + Persuasion | Secret entrance, hazard warnings |
| Goblins "bleed" prisoners | Prison Pit / Bren | Observation / Rescue | Ritual chamber purpose |
| Groz has a "god stone" | Captured goblin | Interrogation | Shard of Shadow |
| Symbol matches temple | Groz's scroll | Investigation | Adventure 2 hook |

### Red Herrings
Optional false leads:
1. Villagers blame a "witch in the woods" for cursing the goblins; investigation reveals she's a harmless herbalist who fled weeks ago.
2. Marta heard the mine was closed due to a monster infestation; it was actually just bad air and economics.

### Revelation Moments
**Twist/Revelation:** The goblins aren't eating the prisoners—they're draining their blood to feed the [[Shard of Shadow]], which grows more powerful with each sacrifice.

**When It's Revealed:** When the party discovers the Prison Pit or interrogates a corrupted goblin.

**Impact:** Raises the stakes dramatically; this isn't simple goblin savagery but something far darker and more purposeful. Suggests an intelligence behind the corruption.

## Hazards & Obstacles

### Traps
| Trap | Location | Trigger | Effect | DC | Damage |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Tripwire Alarm | Mine Entrance | Walking through doorway | Rattling bones alert goblins within 60 ft | 12 Perception to spot, 12 Dex to disarm | None (alarm) |
| Rockfall Trap | Whispering Gallery | Pressure plate | 10x10 area of falling rocks | 13 Perception, 14 Dex to disarm | 2d6 bludgeoning, DC 12 Dex half |
| Pit Trap | Lower Tunnels | False floor | 10-foot deep pit with rusty spikes | 14 Perception, 12 Dex to disarm | 1d6 falling + 1d4 piercing |

### Environmental Hazards
| Hazard | Location | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Bad Air | Upper Tunnels | DC 10 Con save or poisoned 1 hour | Keep moving, wet cloth over face |
| Unstable Floor | Throughout Mine | DC 12 Dex save or fall 10 ft | Test floor with pole, distribute weight |
| Flickering Torches | Lower Tunnels | Torches dim to 10-ft radius near Shard | Magical light resists, extra torches |
| Extreme Cold | Ritual Chamber | DC 10 Con save per 10 minutes or 1 exhaustion | Cold weather gear, complete quickly |

### Puzzles

#### The Locked Gate
**Location:** Entrance to Lower Tunnels

**Description:** A rusted iron gate blocks the path deeper. A crude goblin mechanism (three stone levers) controls the lock. Pulling levers in the wrong order triggers a poison dart trap.

**Solution:** Pull levers in order: Right, Left, Center (the pattern is scratched on a nearby wall in goblin, DC 12 Investigation to find).

**Hints:**
- Goblin scratching on wall shows the sequence
- A dead goblin nearby was killed by poison darts
- Pattern matches constellation visible from mine entrance

**Bypass Options:** DC 15 Thieves' Tools to pick the lock, DC 18 Strength to bend bars, find the key on the Shadow Patrol goblins.

## Branching Paths

### Key Decision Points
| Decision | Options | Consequences |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| How to enter the mine | Main entrance vs. ventilation shaft | Shaft bypasses upper dangers but harder climb |
| Handle captured goblins | Kill, interrogate, or release | Information vs. karma vs. warning Groz |
| Free prisoners first or go straight to Groz | Rescue militia vs. speed | Allies in final fight vs. time saved |
| What to do with the Shard | Destroy, contain, or leave | Immediate end vs. future study vs. recurring threat |
| Groz's fate | Kill or attempt redemption | Certain end vs. risky diplomacy (likely fails) |

### Alternative Approaches
How can the party approach this differently?
- **Stealth:** Use the ventilation shaft, avoid patrols, reach Groz without alerting the tribe. Possible but difficult.
- **Diplomacy:** Attempt to reason with corrupted goblins. Very difficult (DC 20+ Persuasion) due to Shard's influence, but one goblin might be reached.
- **Brute Force:** Fight through every encounter directly. Viable but resource-intensive; may need short rests.
- **Deception:** Disguise as goblins or pretend to be cultists. Requires disguise kit and DC 15 Deception; failure alerts Groz.

### Failure Modes
If things go wrong, how can the adventure continue?
- **Party captured:** Wake in Prison Pit, must escape and try again with fewer resources.
- **Timmy dies:** Adventure becomes about vengeance and preventing future attacks; village mourns.
- **Party retreats:** Can rest in village and try again, but one prisoner dies per day of delay.
- **TPK:** New party hired; previous party's bodies found in mine with their gear.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences
What happens right after the adventure concludes?

**If Successful:** [[Oakhaven]] celebrates with a feast in the party's honor. Timmy is traumatized but safe, clinging to his father. The militia survivors recover and spread tales of the heroes. Father Aldric offers prayers of thanksgiving. The village begins to rebuild its sense of safety.

**If Failed:** [[Oakhaven]] mourns. [[Mayor Haldor]] is broken by grief. Survivors begin fleeing to larger settlements. The goblin raids continue and worsen. Within a month, the village is abandoned.

**If Partial Success:** (Groz defeated but Timmy dies, or Timmy saved but Shard not contained) Mixed emotions. Gratitude tinged with grief or lingering fear. The party is still considered heroes but with an asterisk.

### Long-term Consequences
How does this affect the world going forward?
- The [[Blacktooth Goblins]] are scattered; survivors either flee to the deep wilderness or gradually recover from the corruption over months.
- If the Shard is destroyed, the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] takes notice of who interfered with their artifact.
- If the Shard is contained, it can be studied by sages to learn more about the Imprisoned.
- [[Oakhaven]] becomes a reliable ally and safe haven for the party.
- The party's reputation as capable adventurers spreads throughout [[Westmark]].

### Loose Ends
Unresolved threads that could spawn future adventures:
1. **The Covenant Scroll:** Groz's map shows the [[Oakhaven]] temple with strange symbols. What was he planning?
2. **The Shard's Origin:** Where did it come from? Are there more? What are the "seals" it weakened?
3. **The Whispering God:** Was the voice in Groz's head truly just the Shard, or something greater?
4. **Surviving Goblins:** Some Blacktooths escaped. Will they seek revenge or fade away?

### NPC Fates
| NPC | Fate if Success | Fate if Failure |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Timmy | Recovers, becomes brave if inspired by party | Dies; his loss haunts the region |
| [[Mayor Haldor]] | Grateful, becomes staunch ally | Broken, may take his own life |
| [[Groz]] | Dead, his obsidian eye a grim trophy | Continues corruption, becomes greater threat |
| Bren (Militia) | Recovers, joins village guard, spreads party's fame | Dies in the mine |
| Kara (Militia) | Recovers, becomes party contact in village | Dies in the mine |
| Father Aldric | Grows more vigilant against evil | Flees with refugees |

## Running the Adventure

### GM Notes
Tips for running this adventure effectively:
- Emphasize the sensory details of corruption: black eyes, ozone smell, flickering torches, whispers at the edge of hearing.
- Play up the goblins' unusual behavior—normally cowardly goblins fighting to the death is unsettling.
- Let the party feel clever if they use the ventilation shaft or capture goblins for information.
- Groz should be theatrical—use multiple voices, quote the "Whispering God," make him memorable.
- The Shard should feel wrong to be near; describe cold, nausea, and fleeting dark thoughts to anyone who touches it.

### Pacing Suggestions
- **Session 1:** Village attack, gathering information, travel to mine, upper mine exploration.
- **Session 2:** Lower mines, rescuing prisoners, confronting Groz, escape and celebration.
- If running as one-shot: Condense Act 1, skip Canyon Ambush, reduce exploration encounters.

### Common Player Actions
| If Players... | Then... |
|---------------|---------|
| Try to negotiate with goblins | DC 20 Persuasion; even success only delays combat |
| Set fire to the mine | Upper tunnels collapse; lower tunnels survive but party takes 2d6 damage |
| Take a long rest in the mine | Goblin patrol finds them; ambush encounter |
| Try to purify the Shard | DC 20 Religion or Arcana; failure causes necrotic burst; success contains it temporarily |
| Bring the Shard to the temple | It pulses violently; sets up Adventure 2 |
| Split the party | Isolated group faces harder encounters; reunite dramatically |

### Scaling Difficulty
**For Weaker Parties (3 players or new players):**
- Reduce goblin numbers by 1-2 per encounter
- Groz has 20 fewer HP and no lair action
- Add an extra Potion of Healing from Father Aldric
- Old Varric accompanies them to the entrance (non-combat guide)

**For Stronger Parties (5-6 players or experienced):**
- Add 1-2 goblins per encounter
- Groz has an additional Shadow-Touched Cutthroat
- Add a Shadow (MM) as a minion in the final battle
- Increase trap DCs by 2

### Foreshadowing for Future Adventures
- The symbol on Groz's scroll appears carved into the temple's foundation stones
- The Shard pulses in a rhythm that matches a heartbeat when brought near the temple
- Father Aldric mentions strange dreams since the goblins appeared
- [[Mayor Haldor]]'s debt papers (if discovered) bear a seal that appears later as the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] symbol

## Secrets

1. [[Mayor Haldor]] is deeply in debt to the [[River Compact]] Merchant Guild, which is secretly a front for the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]. He doesn't know this connection.
2. The [[Shard of Shadow]] is a fragment of the Imprisoned's power that seeped through weakening seals. There are other shards scattered across [[Valdoria]], each causing localized corruption.
3. The "Whispering God" Groz worshipped is a distorted echo of the Imprisoned, not a true deity—but the Imprisoned is very real and slowly awakening.
4. Father Aldric has had prophetic nightmares about "shadows consuming the faithful" since the tremor occurred. He hasn't shared this with anyone.
5. The [[Oakhaven]] temple was built atop an ancient seal-stone; the symbol Groz drew matches the seal's pattern.

## Plot Hooks

### Leading Into This Adventure
1. A "Help Wanted" poster in a nearby city offers 50 gp to investigate attacks on [[Oakhaven]].
2. The party is traveling through [[Westmark]] and hears the village alarm bell as they approach.
3. A merchant the party knows mentions his route through [[Oakhaven]] has become too dangerous due to goblin attacks.
4. A desperate villager reaches the nearest town, begging anyone who will listen to help save the children.

### Spawning From This Adventure
1. **To Adventure 2:** Investigating Groz's map leads to disturbing discoveries beneath the Temple of the Lawgiver in [[Oakhaven]].
2. **To Adventure 3:** The [[Shard of Shadow]] needs to be taken to a sage or wizard for study—but the journey is dangerous with such a corrupted artifact.
3. **Long-term Arc:** Father Aldric's dreams worsen; he asks the party to investigate other sites where "the seals weaken."
4. **Side Quest:** Surviving [[Blacktooth Goblins]] are spotted in the [[Thornwood Forest]], possibly recovering or plotting revenge.

**Prompt:**
The entrance to Old Echo Mine, a gaping rocky maw set into a dark forested hillside. Twisted dead vines choke the stone archway, and goblin bone totems hang from rusted chains. Four nervous adventurers—a young human fighter with sword drawn, a robed half-elf wizard clutching a staff, a stocky dwarf cleric bearing a shield with a sun symbol, and a hooded halfling rogue with daggers ready—stand at the threshold, torches raised against the darkness. Purple-black shadow mist seeps from the cave mouth, curling around their boots. Cool blue moonlight from above contrasts with warm orange torchlight. Tense, foreboding atmosphere.

**Prompt:**
A massive underground cavern lit by the eerie violet glow of a jagged black crystal floating above a rough stone dais. Groz, a corrupted goblin chieftain twice normal size with black-veined green skin and one eye replaced by pulsing obsidian, screams in ecstasy as shadow tendrils whip around him. A young human boy lies bound to a pillar, pale and terrified. Four adventurers charge forward—a cleric raises a holy symbol blazing with golden light, a fighter deflects a shadow tendril with his shield, a wizard conjures flames, and a rogue tumbles toward the captive. Shadow-touched goblin guards intercept the heroes. Stalactites drip with condensation, the floor cracked and glowing with dark runes. High stakes desperation.

## Notes
This adventure serves as the campaign opener for a larger story arc involving the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] and the weakening of ancient seals that imprison a great evil. It introduces several key themes:

- **Corruption and redemption:** The goblins are victims as much as villains.
- **Community bonds:** [[Oakhaven]] represents what the party is fighting to protect.
- **Ancient evil:** The [[Shard of Shadow]] is the first glimpse of a greater threat.

Design inspirations include classic "rescue the villagers" quests combined with Lovecraftian corruption elements. The adventure is intentionally straightforward in structure to accommodate new players while seeding mysteries for experienced groups to investigate.

The adventure is designed to be completed in 2-3 sessions but can be compressed to a single long session by reducing exploration and skipping the Canyon Ambush encounter.
