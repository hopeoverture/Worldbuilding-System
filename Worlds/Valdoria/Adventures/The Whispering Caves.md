> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating an adventure, create a complete quest with compelling narrative, balanced encounters, meaningful choices, and satisfying resolution. Consider the hook that draws players in, the obstacles they must overcome, the NPCs they'll meet, and the rewards they'll earn. Adventures should have clear objectives while allowing for player agency and creative solutions.

## Overview
> Write 3-4 sentences establishing this adventure's premise—the central conflict, what's at stake, and why adventurers would take on this quest.
The small village of **Oakhaven** is plagued by disappearances, including the mayor's son, blamed on a local goblin tribe that has recently turned uncharacteristically aggressive. The party must venture into the **Old Echo Mine**, investigating the source of the goblins' madness. Deep within, they will uncover that the goblins have been corrupted by a **Shard of Shadow**, a fragment of the Imprisoned's power, marking the first sign of the ancient evil's return.

## Classification

### Type
**Adventure Type:** Dungeon Crawl / Rescue

**Tone:** Heroic / Mystery / Horror (Mild)

**Themes:**
- Corruption of the innocent (goblins acting against nature)
- The surfacing of ancient evil
- Darkness vs. Light

### Scope
**Estimated Sessions:** 2-3 Sessions

**Party Level:** 1

**Party Size:** 4

### Difficulty
**Overall Difficulty:** Moderate

**Combat Frequency:** High

**Roleplay Emphasis:** Low

**Exploration Emphasis:** Moderate

## The Hook

### How It Begins
The party arrives in Oakhaven to find the village in distress; boarded windows and fearful whispers dominate the atmosphere. They are approached by **Mayor Haldor**, who is desperate for help after the local militia failed to return from searching for his missing son, **Timmy**.

### Quest Giver
**Name:** [[Mayor Haldor]]
**Motivation:** Rescue his son and stop the goblin raids.
**What They Offer:** 50 gold pieces (a fortune for the village) and the gratitude of Oakhaven.

### Initial Information
What do the players learn at the start?
- The **Blacktooth Goblins** were once a nuisance but peaceful traders; now they kill on sight.
- Strange "whispers" have been heard echoing from the valley leading to the mine.
- The mines were abandoned a century ago due to "bad air."

### Urgency
**Time Pressure:** Moderate

**Consequences of Delay:** Timmy and the other captives may be sacrificed or eaten.

## Background

### The Situation
A minor earth tremor caused by the weakening seals cracked open a geode in the deep mines, revealing a **Shard of Shadow**. The Blacktooth tribe found it, and its influence drove them into a murderous frenzy, twisting their bodies and minds. They believe the whispers from the shard are the voice of a "New God" who demands blood.

### History
How did this situation develop?
- **Month ago:** The tremor occurs.
- **Week ago:** The Goblins find the Shard; their chieftain, **Groz**, is the first to be corrupted.
- **Days ago:** Raids on Oakhaven begin.

### Key NPCs' Goals
| NPC | Goal | Method |
|-----|------|--------|
| [[Groz]] (Goblin Boss) | Serve the "Whispering God" | Sacrifice villagers to the Shard |
| [[Timmy]] (Captive) | Survive and escape | Hide and wait for rescue |
| [[Mayor Haldor]] | Save his son | Hire the adventurers |

### What's at Stake
**If the party succeeds:** The village is saved, Timmy returns, and the Shard is contained (or identified as dangerous).

**If the party fails:** Oakhaven is slowly depopulated, and the Shard's influence spreads, creating a zone of corruption.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
Rescue the captives (Timmy and 2 militia members) from the Old Echo Mine.

### Secondary Objectives
- Clear the goblin threat.
- Discover the cause of their madness.

### Hidden Objectives
- Recover the **Covenant Scroll** (hinting at the larger plot).

### Success Conditions
- Timmy is returned alive.
- Groz is defeated.

### Failure Conditions
- Timmy dies.
- Party retreats/wipes.

## Adventure Structure

**Transition to Act 3:** Entering the deep cavern where the Shard rests.

### Act 3: Resolution
**Goal:** Defeat Groz and save Timmy.

**Key Scenes:**
1.  **The Ritual Chamber:** Groz is channeling energy from the Shard into himself.
