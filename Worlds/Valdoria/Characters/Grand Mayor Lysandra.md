# Grand Mayor Lysandra

> [!info] Character Summary
> The elected ruler of the River Compact, Lysandra rose from the slums of the Drowning Wards to become the wealthiest and most politically powerful woman in Valdoria. Calculated, elegant, and ruthless when necessary, she governs through a network of favors, debts, and carefully gathered secrets. She loves her city with fierce devotion but fears the coming war will bankrupt it.

## Overview

Grand Mayor Lysandra is living proof that in Rivergard, gold speaks louder than blood. Born a nameless cutpurse in the sinking slums, she clawed her way to the pinnacle of power through cunning, strategic marriages, and an encyclopedic knowledge of every secret worth knowing. She rules the River Compact not as a queen but as its chief executive—an elected position she has held for twelve years and intends to hold until she dies. Her administration has brought unprecedented prosperity to Rivergard, but dark times are coming, and she knows that her city's wealth makes it a target.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Lysandra is a striking human woman in her late forties with the bearing of someone who has never forgotten what it means to be hungry. She stands at average height with a slender, elegant build that belies surprising wiry strength. Her silver-streaked raven hair is always immaculately styled, often pinned with jeweled clips worth more than most families earn in a decade. Her skin is olive-toned with fine lines around sharp grey eyes that miss nothing. A thin, almost invisible scar runs along her left jawline—the mark of a street fight she won at age twelve. She carries herself with perfect posture and moves with the deliberate grace of someone who once needed to disappear into crowds.

### Attire
Lysandra's signature style combines elegance with practicality. She favors gowns of deep blue or silver silk with modest necklines and sleeves cut for ease of movement. Her jewelry appears tasteful and understated—until one realizes each piece is worth a king's ransom: rings set with flawless sapphires, a necklace of ancient elven silver, earrings of dwarf-cut diamonds. She always wears soft-soled shoes that make no sound on marble floors. Hidden within her clothing are a masterwork dagger in a wrist sheath and several pouches of flash powder and smoke pellets. She considers being unarmed in her own city the height of foolishness.

## Personality

### Traits
1. She treats every conversation as a negotiation, always watching for leverage and calculating the cost-benefit of every word she speaks.
2. She maintains perfect composure in all circumstances, speaking in measured tones that reveal nothing she doesn't intend to show—the colder her smile, the more dangerous the situation.

### Ideals
**Prosperity.** War is bad for business, and poverty breeds the desperation that destroys cities. Every decision she makes serves Rivergard's long-term economic health, even when it requires short-term moral compromise.

### Bonds
The city of Rivergard is her legacy, her masterwork, her beloved child. She climbed from its gutters and built it into the greatest trading power on the continent. She will see it float through whatever storms come, not sink into the waters that perpetually threaten its foundations.

### Flaws
She believes every problem can be solved with sufficient gold, the right information, or the proper leverage. This has served her well, but it leaves her unprepared for threats that cannot be bought, bribed, or blackmailed—like the ancient evils now stirring beneath the world.

### Motivations
Lysandra is driven by two obsessions: protecting Rivergard from the political and economic threats she can see, and ensuring that her legacy outlasts her mortal life. She has no children and no intention of having any—the city itself is her heir. She fears the coming conflict between the kingdoms will drag her neutral city into a war that will bankrupt it and destroy everything she has built.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Criminal (Guild Thief)

**Influence:** Growing up in the Drowning Wards taught Lysandra that the world is divided into predators and prey, and that the only way to survive is to become too valuable to kill. Her criminal past gave her an intimate understanding of how power actually works—not through laws or armies, but through information, leverage, and the willingness to act when others hesitate.

### Early Life
Lysandra was born in a flooded tenement in Rivergard's Drowning Wards to a seamstress mother who died of plague when Lysandra was seven. She survived the next five years as a pickpocket, beggar, and eventually a skilled cutpurse working for a minor thieves' guild. She learned to read from stolen books, to calculate sums faster than merchants' clerks, and to recognize opportunity in the garbage others discarded. At twelve, she killed a man twice her size who tried to claim her as property—her first understanding that violence, properly applied, has its own kind of value.

### Formative Events
1. **The Stolen Ledger (Age 15):** Lysandra stole a merchant prince's accounting ledger on a whim, discovering it contained detailed records of bribes paid to city officials. Rather than sell it, she approached the merchant directly and offered him a choice: partnership or exposure. He chose partnership. This transaction taught her that information is the only currency that appreciates with use.

2. **The First Ship (Age 19):** Using her profits from the ledger arrangement, she purchased a small trading vessel and began her legitimate career. Within five years, she owned a fleet. Within ten, she had married and outlived two wealthy merchants, inheriting their shipping empires. The marriages were arranged for profit, but she mourns both husbands genuinely—they were good men, and she made them happy while they lived.

3. **The Plague Year (Age 35):** When the Plague of Silence struck Rivergard's poor districts, the previous Grand Mayor fled to his country estate. Lysandra stayed. She organized quarantine zones, funded physicians, and personally distributed food to starving families. When the plague passed, the people demanded she take the Mayor's seat. She won the election by the largest margin in the city's history.

### Current Situation
Twelve years into her tenure, Lysandra faces the greatest challenges of her career. The River Compact's neutrality is crumbling as the kingdoms pressure her to choose sides. The rising waters threaten to sink entire districts of the Drowning Wards. The Black Lotus grows bolder, and she suspects their leader has connections to her own Gilded Council. Worst of all, her spies report disturbing news from the frontier—not political threats, but something older and darker stirring in the ruins.

## Combat

### Special Traits

**Cunning Action.** On each of her turns, Lysandra can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Evasion.** If Lysandra is subjected to an effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, she instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if she fails.

**Master of Intrigue.** Lysandra can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of any creature she has heard speak for at least 1 minute. She can pass herself off as a native speaker of any language she knows.

**Master of Tactics.** Lysandra can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when she uses the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of her, rather than 5 feet, if the target can see or hear her.

**Sneak Attack (7d6).** Once per turn, Lysandra deals an extra 24 (7d6) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of hers that isn't incapacitated and she doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Insightful Fighting.** As a bonus action, Lysandra can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature's Charisma (Deception) check. If she succeeds, she can use her Sneak Attack against that target even if she doesn't have advantage, but not if she has disadvantage. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until she successfully uses this feature against a different target.

### Attacks
| Name | Attack Bonus | Damage | Type | Properties |
|------|--------------|--------|------|------------|
| Masterwork Dagger | +6 | 1d4+3 piercing + 7d6 sneak | Piercing | Finesse, light, thrown (20/60) |
| Hidden Dagger (wrist sheath) | +6 | 1d4+3 piercing | Piercing | Finesse, light |
| Poisoned Needle Ring | +6 | 1 piercing + DC 15 CON or paralyzed 1 min | Piercing | Special, 3 uses |

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Lysandra makes two dagger attacks.

**Words of Terror (Recharge 5-6).** Lysandra whispers threats laced with specific knowledge of a creature's secrets. One creature within 30 feet that can hear her must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends, the target is immune to Lysandra's Words of Terror for the next 24 hours.

### Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker Lysandra can see hits her with an attack, she can use her reaction to halve the attack's damage against her.

## Relationships

### Family
Lysandra's mother died when she was seven. She never knew her father. She was married twice—to Merchant Lord Varen (died of fever, year 8 of her career) and to Trade Prince Aldric (died in a shipwreck, year 14). Both marriages were arranged for profit but became genuinely affectionate. She has no children and no living blood relatives she acknowledges.

### Allies
1. **Lord Chancellor Merrick:** Her chief bureaucrat and one of the few people she trusts. He handles the legitimate administration while she handles everything else.
2. **Captain Silas of the River Guard:** The commander of Rivergard's mercenary fleet. He owes her his position and his life (she discovered and covered up an embarrassment from his past).
3. **The Gilded Council (mostly):** The twelve merchant princes who nominally rule the River Compact. She controls seven through debt, blackmail, or genuine alliance.

### Enemies
1. **The Nightmaster:** The leader of the Black Lotus criminal syndicate. Lysandra suspects they have infiltrated her own council but cannot prove it. This enemy knows too much about her past.
2. **King Eldred II of Aerendor:** The aging king sees Rivergard's neutrality as cowardice and has been pressuring her to join an alliance against "threats from the east."

### Romantic Interests
Lysandra has had several discreet affairs since her second husband's death but has never remarried. She currently has no romantic entanglements—she considers them a distraction from her work.

## Story Role

### Arc
Lysandra's potential character arc involves learning that some threats cannot be negotiated with, bribed, or outmaneuvered. As the ancient evils stir and the seals weaken, she must decide whether to commit her city's resources to a fight that offers no profit—and whether there are things more important than the legacy she has spent her life building.

### Goals
**Long-term:** Ensure Rivergard's prosperity and neutrality survive the coming conflicts, then retire knowing her city is secure.

**Short-term:**
1. Identify and neutralize the Nightmaster before they move against her
2. Negotiate a favorable trade agreement with the Iron Holds that doesn't draw Aerendor's ire
3. Find the source of the rising black waters threatening the Drowning Wards

### Conflicts
**Internal:** Lysandra believes she can control any situation with sufficient information and resources. Her inability to comprehend or prepare for supernatural threats genuinely frightens her—a feeling she hasn't experienced since childhood.

**External:** The kingdoms are pressuring her to abandon neutrality. The Black Lotus is growing bolder. The rising waters are accelerating. And strange reports from the frontier suggest threats that cannot be bought off or assassinated.

## Notes
- Lysandra should be played as someone who always has three plans running simultaneously
- She genuinely cares about Rivergard's common people—they are her power base and she remembers being one of them
- She underestimates supernatural threats because her worldview doesn't have room for things money can't solve
- The Nightmaster is likely someone she knows; discovering their identity would be a major revelation
