# Grand Mayor Lysandra

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The elected ruler of the River Compact. She rose from the slums to become the wealthiest woman in Valdoria. Calculated, elegant, and ruthless when necessary. She loves her city but fears the coming war will bankrupt it.

## Appearance
A striking woman in her late 40s with silver-streaked hair and piercing grey eyes. She wears elegant gowns of blue silk but always keeps a hidden dagger. Her jewelry is tasteful but worth a king's ransom.

## Personality
**Traits:** Pragmatic, Observant, Diplomatic.
**Ideal:** Prosperity. War is bad for business.
**Bond:** The city of Rivergard is her legacy; she will see it float, not sink.
**Flaw:** She believes every problem can be solved with gold.

## Background
Lysandra was born in the "Drowning Wards" and learned to survive as a cutpurse. She stole a ledger that contained blackmail material on a merchant prince, used it to buy her first ship, and never looked back. She knows the streets better than the Guard.

## Combat/Abilities
She rarely fights, preferring to use her "Words of Terror" (political pressure) or her elite bodyguards. However, she is a deadly knife-fighter if cornered.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Blackmail:** Lysandra hires the party to recover a stolen ledger that proves she used to be a thief.
2.  **The Deal:** She needs the party to negotiate a secret treaty with [[The Iron Holds]] without the King of Aerendor finding out.
