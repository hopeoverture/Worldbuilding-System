# High King Thrain IV

> [!info] Character Summary
> The ancient ruler of the Dwarven Holds, Thrain has worn the Stone Crown for 150 years and buried three sons in that time. A legendary warrior who has fought more battles than most humans have lived years, he is consumed by grief and vengeance, obsessed with reclaiming the deep halls lost to the Orcs and the things beneath. He blames the surface races for abandoning his people during the Great Siege and trusts no human king's promises.

## Overview

High King Thrain IV has been king since before the grandparents of most human rulers were born. He has seen empires rise and fall, watched generations of allies grow old and die while he endures, and buried more kin than he can bear to count. Once he was called Thrain the Bold, a laughing prince who believed his people's glory would last forever. Now he is the Stone-Father, as unyielding and cold as the mountain itself, driven by a singular purpose: reclaim the deep halls, avenge the fallen, and restore the dwarves to their ancient glory. His obsession with vengeance has made him the greatest warrior-king the holds have known in centuries—and the loneliest dwarf beneath the mountain.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Thrain is massive even by dwarven standards, standing four and a half feet tall with shoulders broad enough to block a doorway. His body is a map of two centuries of war: scars cross his arms and chest, one ear is half-missing, and his left eye is a milky ruin—a gift from an Orc chieftain whose head now decorates Thrain's throne. His remaining eye burns with cold blue fire, and his face beneath the scars is craggy as mountain stone. His hair and beard were once red-gold; now they are iron gray, the beard braided with rings of gold, each ring representing a major victory. Despite his age, he moves with the deadly grace of a warrior who has forgotten more about combat than most will ever learn.

### Attire
Thrain wears the black iron plate armor of the High Kings, forged in the First Age and never broken. It covers him head to toe when he goes to war, though in court he wears only the breastplate and greaves over black leather. The Stone Crown sits on his brow—a circlet of uncut diamonds set in adamantine, so old that no dwarf remembers who crafted it. At his side hangs *Earth-Shaker*, the warhammer of the High Kings, its head engraved with runes that glow when orcs are near. He wears no other decoration; jewelry is for those who have something to celebrate.

## Personality

### Traits
1. He speaks rarely and in short, blunt sentences, as if words are a resource too precious to waste—but when he speaks, all dwarves listen.
2. He remembers every wrong done to his people and every promise broken by surface allies, reciting them like prayers before battle.

### Ideals
**Honor.** A wrong must be righted. A debt must be paid. A promise must be kept. These are the pillars of civilization, and without them, dwarves are no better than the orcs they fight.

### Bonds
The Tombs of the Ancestors—the deep halls where his father, grandfather, and three sons lie entombed—are his sacred duty. The orcs defiled those halls. While a single orc walks those corridors, Thrain cannot rest.

### Flaws
Vengeance has consumed him. He will spend a thousand dwarven lives to avenge a hundred. He judges the present by the failures of the past, refusing to trust surface races who might now prove worthy allies. His grief has calcified into cold fury, leaving no room for hope or mercy.

### Motivations
Thrain wants three things: to reclaim the Deep Roads from the Orcs, to see his sons properly honored in death, and to die in battle worthy of joining them in the Halls of Stone. He has no expectation of happiness, no hope for a better world—only the grim satisfaction of duty fulfilled and vengeance taken, one orc skull at a time.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Noble (Crown Prince)

**Influence:** Thrain was raised to rule an empire. The dwarves of his grandfather's time controlled tunnels that stretched beneath the entire continent, trading with every surface nation from positions of strength. He was trained in war, statecraft, and the ancient histories. He never expected to rule a people in retreat, fighting desperately to hold what remains.

### Early Life
Young Thrain was the jewel of the holds—a prince who could drink any warrior under the table, forge a blade by age fifteen, and lead soldiers at twenty. He married Durna, the daughter of the Eastern Thane, and they had four sons. Life was good. The holds were strong. The darkness below was contained. Then the orcs came, in numbers never seen before, and nothing was ever good again.

### Formative Events
1. **The Great Siege (100 years ago):** The largest orc horde in recorded history poured up from the depths, led by the demon Gorthak the Render. The dwarves sent desperate pleas to every surface kingdom for aid. King Aldric IV of Aerendor promised reinforcements. They never came—delayed by politics, by fear, by a hundred excuses. When the siege finally broke, thirty thousand dwarves lay dead, including Thrain's wife and eldest son. Thrain killed Gorthak with his own hands but has never forgotten who failed to come.

2. **The Fall of the Deep Roads (50 years ago):** Despite a century of war, the orcs pushed deeper. When Thrain's second son, Thorin, led an expedition to seal the lowest tunnels, he and his company were overwhelmed. The Deep Roads—and access to the Tombs of the Ancestors—were lost. Thrain has been planning their reconquest ever since.

3. **The Death of Durin (5 years ago):** Thrain's youngest son, Durin, died in a skirmish that should have been routine. An orc arrow through the throat. No glory, no last stand, just a young prince bleeding out in a minor tunnel. Something broke in Thrain that day. Where before he was grim, now he is merciless.

### Current Situation
At over 350 years old, Thrain is ancient even by dwarven standards. He knows his time is limited, and the thought that he might die before reclaiming the Deep Roads haunts him. He has begun planning a final, massive assault—one that will either restore the lost halls or end in glorious death. He needs allies, resources, and information, but his pride and bitterness make diplomacy difficult. The surface kingdoms approach him with trade offers; he responds with demands for unpaid debts.

## Relationships

### Family
Thrain's wife Durna died in the Great Siege. His eldest son Thorin died sealing the Deep Roads. His second son Korin fell defending a mining expedition. His youngest son Durin died to a stray arrow. He has one surviving grandchild: Princess Brunhild, Thorin's daughter, whom he keeps far from danger despite her warrior's heart.

### Allies
1. **Princess Brunhild:** His granddaughter and heir. Fierce, brave, and the only one who can sometimes make him smile. He is terrified of losing her.
2. **Thane Borgin of the Eastern Holds:** His oldest surviving friend, nearly as ancient as Thrain himself. The only dwarf who can speak to Thrain as an equal.
3. **The Wardens of Stone:** Elite dwarven warriors sworn to protect the royal line. Thrain trusts them with his life.

### Enemies
1. **The Orc Hordes:** Every orc beneath the mountain is his enemy. He has killed thousands personally.
2. **King Eldred II:** Thrain holds the kings of Aerendor responsible for failing his people during the Great Siege. He refuses direct alliance with the "oathbreakers."
3. **The Deep Things:** Whatever drove the orcs upward in the first place—aberrations, demons, the stirring of the Imprisoned—Thrain knows something worse waits in the dark.

### Romantic Interests
Thrain's heart was buried with his wife. He has not considered romance in a century and never will again.

## Story Role

### Arc
Thrain's arc involves learning that vengeance, while satisfying, cannot build a future. His people need allies, not endless war. His grandchild needs a kingdom to inherit, not a tomb to guard. Thrain must choose between the past he cannot change and the future he can still shape—or die trying to avenge the dead while the living suffer.

### Goals
**Long-term:** Reclaim the Deep Roads and the Tombs of the Ancestors; die in battle worthy of his sons.

**Short-term:**
1. Gather intelligence on Deep Roads orc positions
2. Acquire surface allies willing to commit actual troops (not promises)
3. Train his granddaughter to rule after him

### Conflicts
**Internal:** Thrain knows his vendetta is consuming his people's future. He knows he should make peace with the surface kingdoms, should focus on rebuilding rather than reconquest. But every time he considers it, he sees his sons' faces and the rage returns.

**External:** The orcs grow stronger while the dwarves grow weaker. The surface kingdoms offer trade but not troops. And something stirs in the deepest dark—something that may have been driving the orcs toward the surface all along.
