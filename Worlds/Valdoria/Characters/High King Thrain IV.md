# High King Thrain IV

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The ruler of the Dwarves. He is a grim, stoic warrior who has lost almost everything to the endless war with the Orcs. He is obsessed with reclaiming the deep levels.

## Appearance
A massive dwarf clad in plate armor made of black iron. His beard is braided with gold rings—one for every victory. He is missing an eye (lost to an Orc chieftain).

## Personality
**Traits:** Stubborn, Unwavering, Grim.
**Ideal:** Honor. A wrong must be righted. A debt must be paid.
**Bond:** The Tombs of the Ancestors.
**Flaw:** Vengeful. He will sacrifice living soldiers to avenge dead ones.
