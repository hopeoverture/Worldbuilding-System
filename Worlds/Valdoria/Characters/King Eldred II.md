# King Eldred II

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The aging King of Aerendor. Once a great hero who defeated his usurper brother, he is now consumed by paranoia. He sees "Covenant" agents in every shadow and trusts no one.

## Appearance
A tall, gaunt man with a neatly trimmed white beard. He wears the Eagle Crown but it seems heavy on his brow. His hands are always shaking slightly (a curse? or just age?). He wears armor even in court.

## Personality
**Traits:** Suspicious, Traditional, Weary.
**Ideal:** Order. The walls must hold, at any cost.
**Bond:** His only surviving daughter, Princess Elara.
**Flaw:** Paranoia. He imprisons loyal subjects on suspicion of treason.

## Background
Eldred was a beloved prince until the False King's War. He had to kill his own brother on the steps of the throne. That act broke something in him. Now, he refuses to send troops to the borders, hoarding them in the capital to protect himself.

## Combat/Abilities
A master swordsman in his youth, now frail. He commands the Royal Guard and wields the magic sword *Judgement*.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Traitor:** Eldred asks the party to spy on his High General, convinced he is plotting a coup (he isn't).
2.  **The Cure:** The Princess hires the party to find a cure for the King's "madness," suspecting he is being poisoned.
