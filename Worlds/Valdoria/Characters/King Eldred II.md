# King Eldred II

> [!info] Character Summary
> The aging King of Aerendor, once a beloved hero who defeated his usurper brother in the False King's War, now consumed by paranoia and exhaustion. He sees Covenant agents in every shadow, trusts no one completely, and hoards his forces in the capital while his kingdom slowly crumbles at the edges. A tragic figure who desperately wants to protect his realm but whose fear has become the greatest threat to it.

## Overview

King Eldred II ascended the throne forty years ago after putting his own sword through his brother's heart on the steps of the throne room. That necessary act of kinslaying saved the kingdom but broke something fundamental in Eldred's soul. In the decades since, paranoia has eaten away at the bold young prince he once was, leaving a gaunt, suspicious king who sees treachery in every loyal heart. The kingdom that once looked to him as a hero now suffers under his defensive crouch—borders undefended while troops garrison the capital, trade routes abandoned while he obsesses over internal security. His only solace is his daughter, Princess Elara, who desperately tries to govern in his stead while searching for a cure for what she believes is poison or enchantment.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Eldred is a tall human man in his early sixties who looks a decade older. Once powerfully built, he has become gaunt and hollow-cheeked, his muscle wasted from years of restless nights and poor appetite. His hair and neatly trimmed beard have gone completely white, and his eyes—once bright and commanding—are now sunken and constantly moving, tracking threats that may or may not exist. His hands shake perpetually, whether from age, poison, magical curse, or simply decades of accumulated stress, no physician has been able to determine. Deep lines carve his face, mapping forty years of worry and sleepless nights. He stands with rigid military posture but moves with the deliberate caution of someone always expecting an attack.

### Attire
Eldred wears armor at all times—even in his own throne room, even in his private chambers. His plate armor is masterwork, passed down through generations of kings, though he has had it reinforced with additional protection at the joints and back. Over it he wears a surcoat of royal blue bearing the Golden Eagle of Aerendor. The Eagle Crown—a heavy circlet of gold with a rising eagle at the front—sits perpetually on his brow, and he refuses to remove it lest someone steal the symbol of his legitimacy. At his side hangs *Judgement*, the ancestral sword of the kingdom, its blade etched with prayers for righteous rule. He wears no other jewelry save a simple silver ring—his dead wife's wedding band.

## Personality

### Traits
1. He questions everything and everyone, asking the same question multiple ways to catch inconsistencies, and he remembers every answer he's ever received—forever comparing new statements against old ones.
2. He speaks of the past constantly, particularly his brother's betrayal, as if trying to process a wound that has never healed and never will.

### Ideals
**Order.** The walls must hold. The laws must be obeyed. The chain of command must never break. Without structure, civilization falls to the chaos his brother tried to unleash—and Eldred has seen what that chaos looks like.

### Bonds
His only surviving child, Princess Elara, is the single person he trusts completely. She reminds him of who he used to be, before the war, before the killing. If anything happened to her, there would be nothing left of Eldred worth preserving.

### Flaws
Paranoia has become his prison. He imprisons loyal subjects on whispers of treason, keeps armies from the borders where they're needed, and surrounds himself with sycophants because anyone who disagrees might be an enemy. His fear of betrayal has become a self-fulfilling prophecy—good men leave his service, and those who remain tell him only what he wants to hear.

### Motivations
Eldred wants, more than anything, to keep his kingdom safe and to see his daughter securely on the throne after him. But decades of trauma have convinced him that the greatest threats come from within, not without. He genuinely believes the Covenant has infiltrated every level of his court, that his brother's spirit guides enemies against him, and that the only way to protect Aerendor is to maintain absolute control over everything and everyone.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Noble (Crown Prince)

**Influence:** Eldred was raised to rule, educated by the finest tutors, trained in arms by master swordsmen, and groomed for the throne from birth. But nothing in his education prepared him for what ruling actually requires: the compromises, the betrayals, the weight of knowing that your decisions kill people whether you act or not.

### Early Life
Eldred was the second son of King Aldric IV, never expected to inherit. He was the beloved younger prince—charming, brave, a champion jouster and beloved by the common folk. His elder brother Aldred was the serious one, the heir, the scholar. The brothers were close until their father's death, when Aldred revealed ambitions no one had suspected. He moved to dissolve the traditional nobility, seize temple lands, and rule as an absolute tyrant. Eldred was forced to choose between his brother and his kingdom.

### Formative Events
1. **The False King's War (Age 22):** When Aldred's reforms provoked rebellion, Eldred joined the loyalist lords. For three years he fought his own brother, watching friends die on both sides. The war ended when Eldred stormed the throne room and found Aldred waiting. His brother offered him one last chance to join him. Eldred responded with *Judgement*, running Aldred through. His brother's last words were: "You'll become worse than me. You'll see."

2. **The Queen's Death (Age 35):** Queen Miriel died giving birth to their third child—a stillborn son. Eldred blamed himself for wanting an heir badly enough to risk her health. After her death, he began seeing enemies everywhere, convinced that someone had cursed the birth.

3. **The Covenant Revelation (Age 50):** A captured Covenant spy, under torture, confessed that agents had infiltrated "the highest levels" of Aerendor's government. He died before naming names. Since then, Eldred has trusted no one, seeing Covenant shadows in every unexplained event.

### Current Situation
At sixty-two, Eldred spends his days in security meetings and his nights in sleepless vigil. He has stationed the bulk of his army in the capital, leaving border lords to fend for themselves. The treasury drains into a network of informants and secret police. His daughter Elara handles most actual governance while he obsesses over internal threats. The kingdom weakens while he watches for knives in the dark, never seeing the slow collapse he himself has caused.

## Relationships

### Family
Eldred's parents are long dead. His brother Aldred died by Eldred's own hand. His wife Miriel died in childbirth. He has one surviving child: Princess Elara, the light of his life and the only person he trusts completely. Two sons died in infancy; the third was stillborn with their mother.

### Allies
1. **Princess Elara:** His daughter and heir. She manages the kingdom's actual governance while he focuses on security. She loves him but fears what he's becoming.
2. **Lord General Kaelen:** Commander of the Royal Legions, a loyal soldier who follows orders even when he disagrees. Eldred alternates between trusting him absolutely and suspecting him of conspiracy.
3. **High Priest Aldous:** The elderly head of the Silver Flame in Aerendor. One of the few voices Eldred occasionally listens to, though with increasing suspicion.

### Enemies
1. **Grand Mayor Lysandra:** He sees Rivergard's neutrality as cowardice or, worse, evidence that they're already compromised by the Covenant.
2. **The Covenant (real and imagined):** The actual conspiracy that killed his spy has become, in his mind, an all-powerful enemy behind every misfortune.
3. **His Brother's Memory:** Eldred still argues with Aldred in his dreams, still hears his brother's dying prophecy.

### Romantic Interests
Eldred has been a widower for twenty-seven years. Several lords have suggested he remarry to produce a male heir. He refuses absolutely—partly from lingering grief, partly from fear of loving someone again.

## Story Role

### Arc
Eldred's arc is fundamentally tragic. He is a good man who has been broken by trauma and is now causing the very catastrophe he fears. His redemption, if possible, would involve recognizing that his paranoia has become the threat—and trusting others enough to let them help. More likely, his arc ends with his daughter having to choose between her father and her kingdom.

### Goals
**Long-term:** Protect Aerendor from the Covenant conspiracy he believes threatens everything.

**Short-term:**
1. Root out Covenant infiltrators in his court
2. Prevent any alliance that might expose his kingdom to outside influence
3. See Princess Elara safely married to someone loyal

### Conflicts
**Internal:** Part of Eldred knows his brother was wrong—that he isn't becoming a tyrant. But another part remembers Aldred's dying words and wonders if the prophecy is coming true. This internal war makes him paranoid about his own decisions.

**External:** The kingdom crumbles while he guards against internal threats. The Covenant is real but not as powerful as he believes. And the true supernatural threat—the awakening Imprisoned—goes unnoticed while he watches for political enemies.

## Notes
- Eldred is meant to be sympathetic despite his flaws—a hero broken by circumstance
- The Covenant has genuinely infiltrated his court (Lord Chancellor's secretary is an agent)
- His trembling hands may be poison, curse, or simply stress—leave ambiguous
- He can be redeemed if players help Elara break through his paranoia
