# The Nightmaster

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The mysterious leader of the Black Lotus guild. No one knows their true identity, and they use Changeling abilities to walk among the people unnoticed. They want power, pure and simple.

## Appearance
Never seen without a mask—a smooth, black porcelain face with no features. Or, seen as a beggar, a noble, or a guard, without anyone knowing.

## Personality
**Traits:** Calculating, Deceptive, Ambitious.
**Ideal:** Control. Chaos is just a ladder.
**Bond:** The Black Lotus is their instrument.
**Flaw:** Overconfidence. Believes they can outsmart even the ancient powers.

## Background
Rumor says the Nightmaster is actually a banished noble from the First Age, kept alive by dark pacts. In truth, the title is passed down, or perhaps they really are immortal. They run the criminal underworld with absolute efficiency.

## Combat/Abilities
Master of disguise and poison. Wields shadow magic to vanish.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Identity:** The party finds a clue that suggests the Nightmaster is actually a member of the Gilded Council.
2.  **The Job:** The Nightmaster makes the party an offer they can't refuse.
