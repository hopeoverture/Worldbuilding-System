# The Nightmaster

> [!info] Character Summary
> The mysterious leader of the Black Lotus criminal syndicate, the Nightmaster is a changeling of unknown age who has worn a thousand faces and forgotten their original one. They seek power for its own sake—power over the underworld, over the city, and eventually over the entire River Compact. Their true identity remains unknown even to their closest lieutenants, and they have cultivated this mystery into a weapon more potent than any blade.

## Overview

No one knows who the Nightmaster truly is—not even the Nightmaster remembers. Whether they are an immortal entity, a title passed between masters, or a changeling who has lived so many lives they've lost track of the original, the truth has been buried beneath layers of deception. What is known: the Nightmaster controls the Black Lotus with absolute authority, has eyes and ears in every corner of Rivergard, and plays a game whose ultimate objective remains hidden. They have transformed the Lotus from common thugs into a professional criminal empire that runs with corporate efficiency, and they move through the city's highest and lowest circles wearing whatever face serves their purpose.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
The Nightmaster's true form—assuming they still have one—is that of a pale, androgynous changeling with features that seem to slip and shift even when not actively changing. Their eyes are solid pools of black, reflecting nothing. In this form, they appear ageless, neither young nor old, neither male nor female. They stand at average height with a slight build that becomes whatever they need it to be. Most who interact with the Nightmaster see only the mask: a smooth, featureless face of black porcelain that covers them completely, showing no eyes, no mouth, no features whatsoever.

### Attire
In their role as Nightmaster, they wear form-concealing robes of black silk over dark leather armor. The porcelain mask is their signature—seamless, expressionless, terrifying in its blankness. They carry no visible weapons, though a dozen are concealed on their person at all times. When wearing other faces, they dress to match the role perfectly: a noble's finery, a beggar's rags, a guard's uniform, a merchant's practical attire. They own wardrobes in every district, stashed in safe houses known only to them.

## Personality

### Traits
1. They speak in measured, cultured tones through the mask, but their voice carries an undertone that makes listeners' skin crawl—as if something wrong is wearing the shape of language.
2. They treat everything as a game of strategy, viewing people as pieces to be positioned, relationships as leverage to be exploited, and emotions as weaknesses to target.

### Ideals
**Control.** Chaos is not a ladder; chaos is a tool. True power comes from being the invisible hand that shapes the chaos others see. The one who controls the underworld controls the city. The one who controls the city controls the trade. The one who controls the trade controls the continent.

### Bonds
The Black Lotus is their instrument, their legacy, their masterwork. They have spent decades building it from a ragtag gang into a shadow empire. They will not see it threatened, subverted, or taken from them by anyone—including the Grand Mayor, who was once one of them.

### Flaws
Overconfidence is their blind spot. They have manipulated so many people for so long that they believe themselves capable of outmaneuvering anyone—including powers far older and more dangerous than themselves. They cannot conceive of a threat they cannot plan around.

### Motivations
The Nightmaster wants to rule Rivergard from the shadows, with the Grand Mayor as their puppet (or removed and replaced by a more pliable figurehead). Beyond that, they seek to expand the Lotus's influence throughout the River Compact and eventually the entire continent. Power is both means and end—they collect it the way dragons collect gold, for the pleasure of having it.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Criminal (Guild Master)

**Influence:** The Nightmaster's past is deliberately obscured. They may have been born a changeling in the slums, may have been something else that learned to shift, or may be a title inherited from previous Nightmasters. They cultivate all theories, adding to their mystique.

### Early Life
The being who became the Nightmaster claims no history before the Black Lotus. Rumors suggest they were a foundling raised by the previous guildmaster, or a spy from another city who murdered their way to the top, or an immortal creature who has led the guild for centuries. The Nightmaster neither confirms nor denies any of it.

### Formative Events
1. **The Consolidation (40 years ago):** The Nightmaster emerged from the chaos of a guild war to unite the Black Lotus's fragmented factions under their absolute authority. Those who opposed the unification disappeared. Those who submitted prospered. Within five years, the Lotus controlled Rivergard's underworld.

2. **The Mayor's Secret:** The Nightmaster knows that Grand Mayor Lysandra was once a thief for the Lotus. They have kept this secret in reserve for decades, watching her rise, waiting for the moment when the revelation would be most valuable. That moment may be approaching.

3. **The Whispers (Recent):** In the past year, the Nightmaster has experienced strange dreams—visions of chains breaking, of shadows stirring beneath the world. They have begun making contact with the Cult of the Shackled God, not out of faith, but because the Cult represents a power they might harness or, failing that, sell information about to the highest bidder.

### Current Situation
The Nightmaster stands at a crossroads. Their control of Rivergard's underworld is nearly complete, but the Grand Mayor has proven more resilient than expected. War threatens to disrupt the profitable status quo. And something stirs in the darkness that the Nightmaster cannot identify or manipulate—which frightens them more than they will admit. They are playing multiple angles: approaching the Cult, undermining the Mayor, negotiating with outside powers, and preparing contingencies for every scenario they can imagine.

## Combat

### Special Traits

**Shapechanger.** The Nightmaster can use an action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid they have seen, or back into their true form. Their statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment they're wearing or carrying isn't transformed. They revert to their true form if they die.

**Changeling Instincts.** The Nightmaster has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to avoid detection while shapeshifted.

**Assassinate.** During the first turn of combat, the Nightmaster has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

**Sneak Attack (9d6).** Once per turn, the Nightmaster deals an extra 31 (9d6) damage when they hit a target with a weapon attack and have advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally that isn't incapacitated.

**Evasion.** If the Nightmaster is subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, they take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

**Awakened Mind.** The Nightmaster can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet. The creature need not share a language.

**Entropic Ward (Recharges after Short Rest).** When a creature makes an attack roll against the Nightmaster, they can impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses, the Nightmaster's next attack roll against that creature has advantage.

**Thought Shield.** The Nightmaster's thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means. They have resistance to psychic damage.

**Pact Magic.** The Nightmaster can cast the following warlock spells (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit):
- **At will:** Disguise Self, Mage Hand (invisible)
- **5/day each:** Darkness, Detect Thoughts, Hold Person, Invisibility
- **3/day each:** Fear, Dimension Door, Dominate Person
- **1/day:** Modify Memory

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The Nightmaster makes two attacks.

**Shadow Step (Bonus Action).** The Nightmaster can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space they can see that is in dim light or darkness. They then have advantage on the first melee attack they make before the end of the turn.

### Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker the Nightmaster can see hits them with an attack, they can halve the attack's damage.

## Relationships

### Family
Unknown. The Nightmaster may have had a family once; if so, they have forgotten or deliberately erased that connection. They are alone by choice and by nature.

### Allies
1. **The Shadow Council:** The five lieutenants who run the Lotus's operations: The Hand (theft), The Eye (information), The Blade (assassination), The Coin (money laundering), and The Mask (legitimate fronts). Each knows a different face of the Nightmaster; none know the truth.
2. **Various Corrupt Officials:** Guards, judges, and minor nobles who have been bribed, blackmailed, or both.
3. **The Cult of the Shackled God (tentative):** The Nightmaster has made contact with the Prophet of Chains, exploring whether the Cult can be used or exploited.

### Enemies
1. **Grand Mayor Lysandra:** She escaped the underworld to become legitimate; the Nightmaster sees this as both a betrayal and an opportunity. They want to either control her or destroy her.
2. **Captain Silas of the River Guard:** The only law enforcement officer the Nightmaster hasn't been able to corrupt or kill. A persistent annoyance.
3. **Rival Criminal Organizations:** The Free Towns gangs who want to muscle into Rivergard territory.

### Romantic Interests
The Nightmaster does not form romantic attachments. Such connections create vulnerabilities they cannot afford.

## Story Role

### Arc
The Nightmaster is fundamentally a wild card—they could become an unlikely ally against the greater evil of the Shackled God (they like the world as it is; they profit from it), or they could attempt to bargain with the darkness and be destroyed by it. Their arc involves learning that some forces cannot be controlled, manipulated, or bargained with—and choosing what to do with that knowledge.

### Goals
**Long-term:** Control Rivergard completely through a puppet government, then expand the Lotus's influence across the continent.

**Short-term:**
1. Acquire leverage over Grand Mayor Lysandra or remove her from power
2. Determine whether the Cult of the Shackled God can be exploited or must be opposed
3. Eliminate the rising gang threat from the Free Towns

### Conflicts
**Internal:** The Nightmaster has forgotten who they were before the mask. Sometimes, in quiet moments, they wonder if they ever existed at all, or if the role has consumed the person entirely. This existential doubt is the one crack in their armor of confidence.

**External:** The Grand Mayor is proving difficult to manipulate. The Cult represents a power the Nightmaster doesn't understand. And the stirring darkness in the world threatens to upset the profitable order they have built.

- They know Lysandra's secret and have been waiting for the right moment to use it
