# The Prophet of Chains

> [!info] Character Summary
> Once a respected High Priest of the Silver Flame named Malakor, this tiefling ventured into the Citadel of Tears seeking to strengthen the seals and gazed upon the First Seal itself. What he saw broke his mind and filled it with the whispers of the Imprisoned. Now he leads the Cult of the Shackled God, believing that breaking the seals and releasing the ancient evil is an act of mercy—that existence itself is suffering, and only total dissolution can bring peace.

## Overview

The Prophet of Chains is the primary mortal agent of the Imprisoned's awakening, a once-good man transformed into a monster by truths no mortal mind should witness. He does not see himself as a villain; he genuinely believes he is saving the world from the prison of existence. His charisma and conviction make him terrifyingly effective at converting the desperate, the traumatized, and the philosophical to his cause. He speaks of liberation, of ending all suffering, of the "peace beyond the chains"—and he means every word. The fact that his vision would mean the end of all life is, to him, precisely the point.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
Malakor was once a handsome tiefling with red skin and proud horns. That creature is barely visible beneath what he has become. His skin has faded to corpse-gray, stretched tight over prominent bones as if something inside is consuming him from within. His horns have grown twisted, covered in scarified runes that seem to move when viewed peripherally. His eyes are solid black voids—not the darkness of a changeling's gaze, but absolute emptiness, as if his eye sockets open into nothing at all. Rusted chains are wrapped around his body, embedded in his flesh in places, moving of their own accord like living things. He does not walk so much as glide, his feet sometimes touching the ground, sometimes not.

### Attire
The Prophet wears tattered robes that were once the white vestments of the Silver Flame, now gray with age and stained with things better left unnamed. The holy symbols have been defaced, replaced with the Cult's mark—a broken circle with chains. Rusted iron chains wrap around him like a second garment, some hanging loose, others embedded in his flesh. He wears no shoes; his feet are blackened as if frostbitten. At his waist hangs a censer that emits not incense but a cold, dark mist that makes those nearby uncomfortable without knowing why.

## Personality

### Traits
1. He speaks in a soft, gentle voice that somehow carries across vast distances, as if whispering directly into each listener's mind—and his words carry a conviction that makes even the absurd seem reasonable.
2. He treats potential converts with genuine compassion and patience, spending hours answering questions and addressing doubts, because he truly believes he is offering them salvation.

### Ideals
**Liberation.** Existence is a cage. The Shackled God understood this and was imprisoned for speaking the truth. To end suffering, we must end the source of suffering—existence itself. This is not destruction; it is mercy. It is waking from a nightmare.

### Bonds
The Shackled God speaks to him in dreams and waking visions. This voice is his master, his god, his only true companion. The Cult members are his children, souls he is guiding toward peace. He loves them in his broken way.

### Flaws
He is utterly, genuinely insane. He cannot perceive his actions as harmful because his corrupted mind truly believes he is helping. This makes him impossible to reason with and immune to moral arguments—he has already considered and dismissed them all.

### Motivations
The Prophet wants to break all seven seals, release the Imprisoned, and allow the dissolution of reality. He believes this will end all suffering everywhere, that the souls consumed by the Void will finally know peace. He works toward this goal with patience and certainty, because he knows—he has seen—that the seals are weakening. The time is coming.

## Background

### Origin
**Background:** Acolyte (High Priest of the Silver Flame)

**Influence:** Malakor spent forty years as one of the most respected priests in Valdoria, counseling kings and comforting the dying. His faith was unshakable—until he decided to test it by confronting the source of evil itself.

### Early Life
Born to tiefling parents who abandoned him at a Silver Flame orphanage, Malakor grew up believing that faith could overcome the darkness of his infernal heritage. He dedicated his life to proving that tieflings were not inherently evil, rising through the temple hierarchy through genuine piety and exceptional wisdom. He performed miracles. He counseled the powerful. He was considered a candidate for the highest religious offices. And then, seeking to understand why the gods had fallen silent, he journeyed to the Citadel of Tears.

### Formative Events
1. **The Silence Begins (15 years ago):** Malakor noticed that divine guidance was becoming harder to receive. Prayers went unanswered. Miracles required greater effort. He began researching ancient texts about the seals that bound evil, seeking to understand what was happening to the world's divine connection.

2. **The Journey to the Citadel (10 years ago):** Against all advice, Malakor led an expedition to the Citadel of Tears, the site of the First Seal. He intended to strengthen the seal, to prove his faith by confronting the greatest evil. He was the only one to reach the seal chamber. He was the only one to return.

3. **The Revelation:** What Malakor saw in that chamber—the face of the Imprisoned, the truth of reality, the nature of existence—shattered his mind and rebuilt it in a new configuration. He emerged understanding that everything he had believed was wrong, that the Imprisoned was not evil but enlightened, that the seals were the true prison and existence the true punishment.

### Current Situation
For ten years, the Prophet has been building his Cult, converting the desperate and the thoughtful with equal effectiveness. He has established the Citadel of Tears as his base, twisted the site of the First Seal into a temple of anti-faith. His Cult numbers in the thousands across Valdoria, hidden in every city, present in every institution. He has identified the locations of three of the seven seals and is working to corrupt or break each one. The time is nearly right. The chains are nearly broken.

## Combat

### Special Traits

**Corrupted Existence.** The Prophet is sustained by the Imprisoned's power. He does not need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. He is immune to aging.

**Whispers of the Void.** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the Prophet must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to speak (including casting spells with verbal components) until the start of its next turn. Creatures who have heard the Prophet speak before have disadvantage on this save.

**Touch of the Grave.** Melee spell attacks made by the Prophet deal an extra 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.

**Reaper.** When the Prophet casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, it can instead target two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other.

**Strength of the Grave (1/Long Rest).** When damage reduces the Prophet to 0 hit points, he can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + damage taken). On success, he drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Shadow Walk.** As a bonus action, the Prophet can teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space in dim light or darkness that he can see.

**Hound of Ill Omen (3/Long Rest).** The Prophet can summon a shadowy dire wolf that targets a creature he can see within 120 feet. The hound has the statistics of a dire wolf with the following changes: it is Medium, has 40 HP, and attacks have advantage if the target is in dim light or darkness.

### Attacks
| Name | Attack Bonus | Damage | Type | Properties |
|------|--------------|--------|------|------------|
| Chain Lash (living chains) | +10 | 2d8+5 bludgeoning + 4d6 necrotic | Bludgeoning/Necrotic | Reach 15 ft., restraining |

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The Prophet makes two Chain Lash attacks or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Chains of the Imprisoned (Recharge 5-6).** Each creature within 30 feet of the Prophet must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by spectral chains for 1 minute. A restrained creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns. While restrained, the creature takes 14 (4d6) cold damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Spellcasting.** The Prophet is a 17th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks).

*The Prophet has no interest in material wealth. The Cult's treasury exists only to fund operations.*

## Relationships

### Family
Malakor's parents abandoned him as an infant. He was raised by the Silver Flame temple. That temple is now his enemy. He has no living family and claims no connection to his mortal past.

### Allies
1. **The Inner Circle:** Seven corrupted priests who have also glimpsed the truth. Each leads a regional Cult cell. All are fanatically loyal.
2. **The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth:** A parallel organization that seeks to break the seals through political manipulation rather than direct action. The Prophet coordinates with them but does not control them.
3. **The Nightmaster (tentative):** The Black Lotus leader has approached the Cult. The Prophet sees them as a useful tool—their corruption is already beginning, whether they know it or not.

### Enemies
1. **The Silver Flame:** His former order has declared him anathema. They would kill him on sight—if they could.
2. **The Order of the Silver Flame (Military Arm):** Paladins specifically tasked with hunting the Cult.
3. **Every Sane Person:** Anyone who understands what the Prophet actually wants would oppose him.

### Romantic Interests
The Prophet is beyond such concerns. The pleasures of mortal existence hold no meaning for one who has seen the truth beyond all truths.

## Story Role

### Arc
The Prophet is a tragic villain—a good man destroyed by truths he was not meant to know. His arc cannot end in redemption; what he saw cannot be unseen, what was broken cannot be mended. The best possible outcome is that he fails in his mission and finds death before causing more harm. The worst is that he succeeds, and everything ends.

### Goals
**Long-term:** Break all seven seals, release the Imprisoned, and end the "suffering" of existence.

**Short-term:**
1. Corrupt or destroy the Second and Third Seals
2. Convert more followers to spread the message
3. Infiltrate the remaining temples to identify seal guardians

### Conflicts
**Internal:** In rare moments of clarity, the part of Malakor that was once a good man screams silently. He knows what he has become. He cannot stop it. The whispers are too loud, the truth too clear. This remaining spark of his old self is the only thing that gives him pause—and it is fading.

**External:** Every force of good in the world opposes him, even if they don't know his name. The kingdoms, the temples, the orders of paladins—all would unite against him if they understood the threat. His challenge is acting before they do.

## Notes
- The Prophet is not evil in his own mind—he genuinely believes he is helping
- He cannot be reasoned with; his sanity is gone beyond recovery
- He knows partial information about all seal locations
- His remaining spark of original self might give players a brief opening in combat (hesitation)
