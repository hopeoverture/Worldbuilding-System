# Cosmology of Valdoria

## Overview
Valdoria exists within a cosmology of nine interconnected planes, layered like veils of reality around the Material World. While most mortals live their entire lives touching only the physical realm, the other planes influence events through dreams, death, magic, and the rare natural portals where boundaries thin. Planar travel is possible but uncommon—a matter for powerful mages, divine intervention, or the misfortune of stumbling through an unseen crossing.

## The Nine Planes

### The Material Plane (Valdoria)
**Nature:** The physical world where mortals live, nations rise and fall, and the great drama of history unfolds.

**Characteristics:**
- Subject to natural laws (modified by magic)
- Where the Architects of Dawn did their work
- Above the seals that bind the Imprisoned

**Mortal Access:** Home plane; no travel required.

---

### The Feywild
**Nature:** A vibrant, magical echo of the Material Plane where nature runs wild and emotion shapes reality. Colors burn brighter, seasons shift with mood, and time flows strangely.

**Characteristics:**
- Ruled by capricious Fey Courts (Seelie and Unseelie)
- Geographically mirrors the Material but transformed
- Time passes differently (hours there may be years here, or vice versa)
- Emotions and nature magic amplified
- Beauty and danger intertwined

**Known Crossings:**
- Ancient forest groves at dawn on solstices
- Fairy rings of mushrooms in deep woods
- Locations where Yavandil's influence runs strong

**Dangers:** Getting lost in time, bargains with fey, emotional manipulation, losing yourself to the wild.

---

### The Shadowfell
**Nature:** A dark, muted reflection of the Material where everything trends toward entropy, despair, and memory of what was lost.

**Characteristics:**
- Colors muted to greys and blacks
- Populated by undead, dark fey, and shadow creatures
- Emotions drain toward melancholy and apathy
- Places of death or tragedy echo strongly here
- The Raven Queen (if she exists) may hold court

**Known Crossings:**
- Ancient battlefields at midnight
- Places of mass death or great tragedy
- Locations under Mornathor's shadow (though he does not rule here)

**Dangers:** Soul-draining despair, shadow entities, becoming lost in darkness, the pull toward oblivion.

---

### The Elemental Planes
**Nature:** Four (or more) realms of pure elemental essence—Fire, Water, Earth, Air—and their combinations.

**The Core Four:**
| Plane | Nature | Dangers |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Fire** | Endless flames, magma seas, smoke-choked skies | Burning, suffocation, fire creatures |
| **Water** | Infinite ocean, crushing depths, strange currents | Drowning, pressure, aquatic predators |
| **Earth** | Solid stone, crystal caverns, grinding tectonics | Crushing, entombment, quakes |
| **Air** | Endless sky, floating islands, eternal storms | Falling, lightning, wind creatures |

**Crossings:** Rare and dangerous—usually through volcanic vents (Fire), deep sea trenches (Water), cavern depths (Earth), or mountain peaks (Air).

**Relevance to Valdoria:** The Architects drew upon elemental forces to shape the world. Elemental incursions are rare but devastating.

---

### The Celestial Thrones (Divine Realm)
**Nature:** The realm where the Seven dwell—a vast circular hall beneath a sky where sun and moon share the heavens.

**Characteristics:**
- Seven thrones of varied materials ring a central eternal flame
- An eighth throne stands empty and veiled
- Beauty beyond mortal comprehension
- Time has little meaning
- Mortals cannot easily travel here

**Access:**
- The dead pass through en route to judgment
- Rare divine visions
- Legendary heroes, once, may have been summoned
- Currently inaccessible—even the gods seem unable to reach out

**Current Crisis:** Something blocks communication between the Thrones and the Material. The Seven's voices do not carry as they once did.

---

### The Infernal/Abyssal Realms
**Nature:** Planes of evil, punishment, and demonic power. Whether these are separate planes (ordered Hells vs. chaotic Abyss) or aspects of the same darkness is debated.

**Characteristics:**
- Tiered layers of torment and corruption
- Ruled by archdevils, demon lords, or worse
- Source of fiendish summons and dark pacts
- The wicked may be condemned here after death
- Some scholars connect these planes to the Imprisoned's origin

**Access:** 
- Forbidden summoning magic
- Natural portals in places of extreme evil
- Souls of the damned

**Relevance to Valdoria:** The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth may draw power from these planes—or from something worse.

---

### The Astral Plane
**Nature:** The realm of thought, dreams, and the silver void between planes. A sea of silver light where ideas take form and the mind travels freely.

**Characteristics:**
- Silvery void with floating islands of condensed thought
- Dreams echo here; dreamers may briefly touch this plane
- Psychic creatures and entities of pure thought dwell here
- Time barely flows; travelers barely age
- The "medium" through which planar travel occurs

**Access:**
- Deep meditation or trance
- Dream magic (Silmarwen's domain)
- Psychic abilities
- Certain spells and rituals

**Relevance to Valdoria:** The Imprisoned's dreams bleed into reality through the Astral. Dreamwalkers report disturbing visions from this realm.

---

### The Ethereal Plane
**Nature:** A ghostly overlap with the Material—visible but intangible, existing slightly "out of phase" with reality.

**Characteristics:**
- Appears as a misty version of the Material world
- Ghosts and spirits naturally exist here
- Allows seeing into the Material but not interacting
- Borders the Material most closely
- Certain creatures phase between planes

**Access:**
- Etherealness spells
- Ghost touch effects
- Natural thin points near haunted locations

**Relevance to Valdoria:** Ghosts of the dead linger here when they cannot pass on. With Mornathor growing silent, more souls may be trapped.

---

### The Prison (Unique to Valdoria)
**Nature:** Not a true plane but a dimensional prison carved from the space between spaces by the Architects of Dawn—a sealed wound in reality containing the Imprisoned.

**Characteristics:**
- Exists "beneath" reality, sealed by seven bindings
- Neither fully elemental, astral, nor material
- The Imprisoned cannot escape but can dream
- The seals manifest on the Material as specific locations
- The weakening seals crack reality around them

**Access:**
- No known entry exists (by design)
- The Imprisoned tries to create exits through corruption
- The seals can theoretically be broken from either side

**The Seals:**
1-6. Physical locations scattered across Valdoria (mountains, seas, ruins)
7. The Seventh Seal is conceptual—maintained by mortal faith and memory

**Current Crisis:** Three seals have weakened. The fourth is failing. The Prison's walls thin.

## Planar Relationships

### Mirrors and Echoes
```
         Feywild (Light/Wild)
              ↕
Material ←→ Ethereal ←→ Astral → All Planes
              ↕
         Shadowfell (Dark/Entropy)
```

The Feywild and Shadowfell "mirror" the Material. The Ethereal overlaps it. The Astral connects all.

### The Vertical Cosmology
```
Celestial Thrones (Divine Above)
         ↑
    Material Plane
         ↓
Infernal/Abyssal (Evil Below)
         ↓
    The Prison (Sealed Beneath All)
```

The Imprisoned is sealed at the "bottom" of reality, beneath even the hells.

### Planar Bleeding
Where planes overlap, reality warps:
- **Fey Crossings:** Wild magic, time distortion, emotional weather
- **Shadow Crossings:** Darkness, despair, undead activity
- **Elemental Breach:** Pure destruction, environmental extremes
- **Prison Leakage:** Corruption, madness, dark whispers

## Natural Portals

### Types of Crossings

| Portal Type | Destination | Triggers |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Fairy Circles | Feywild | Moonlight, solstices, music |
| Death Gates | Shadowfell | Mass death, midnight, grief |
| Elemental Vents | Elemental Planes | Natural extremes |
| Thin Points | Ethereal | Haunted locations |
| Dream Wells | Astral | Deep sleep, psychic activity |
| Corrupted Ground | Prison influence | Near failing seals |

### Known Fixed Portals
- **The Whispering Glade** — A permanent fey crossing in ancient forests
- **The Mourner's Field** — A battlefield where the Shadowfell bleeds through
- **The Deep Vent** — An underwater portal to the Plane of Water
- **The Dreaming Pool** — A still lake where the Astral touches reality

## Cosmological Threats

### The Great Danger: The Prison
The Prison was designed to be inescapable. It is failing.

**Signs of Weakening:**
- Dreams of darkness spreading among the sensitive
- Wild magic surges near seal locations
- Increased planar bleeding (more crossings appearing)
- The divine silence (something drains power meant for gods)

### Secondary Threats
- **Fey Incursions** — Courts seeking to expand influence
- **Shadow Expansion** — Darkness creeping into the Material
- **Infernal Bargains** — Fiends offering power in exchange for souls
- **Elemental Imbalance** — Natural disasters from planar stress

---

## Secrets

1. **The Prison's Nature** — The Imprisoned is not imprisoned in a plane. The "plane" exists because the Imprisoned is there—it is made of the entity's dreams. As it wakes, the plane becomes more real.

2. **The Eighth's Exile** — The Eighth God is imprisoned in a sub-realm of the Astral, a bubble of reality sealed away. It seeks to merge with the Imprisoned—they may have been one being once.

3. **The Planar Drain** — Something is siphoning energy from all planar connections simultaneously. Divine magic, fey bargains, even elemental summons are weakening. The Imprisoned is feeding on the boundaries themselves.

---

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Multiplying Crossings** — Fey and shadow portals are appearing at alarming rates. Investigation reveals the Prison's weakening is destabilizing all planar boundaries.

2. **The Astral Nightmare** — A dreamwalker has become lost in the Astral, trapped in what they describe as "the Imprisoned's dream." Rescue is needed—and what they learned could change everything.

3. **The Elemental Surge** — An elemental breach threatens a city. Closing it reveals that something is deliberately punching holes in reality.

4. **The Ghost Accumulation** — Souls are not passing to Mornathor's Grey Halls. Thousands of ghosts gather in the Ethereal, afraid and confused. What blocks their passage?
