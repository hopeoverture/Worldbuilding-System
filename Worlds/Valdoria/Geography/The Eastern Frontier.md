# The Eastern Frontier

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a region, create a distinct area with unified geographic, cultural, or political character. Include its terrain, climate, settlements, and the peoples who inhabit it. Regions should feel like coherent places with their own identity while fitting into the larger continent.

## Overview
The Eastern Frontier is the catch-all term for the wild lands east of [[The Sundered Peaks]] and outside the [[The Whisperwood]]. It is a land of opportunity and lawlessness, where petty warlords carve out fiefdoms and adventurers seek lost ruins. No king rules here; protection comes from steel and stone walls. It is rugged, beautiful, and deadly—the edge of the map for civilized folk.
