# The Greenfields

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating plains, create a vast open landscape that stretches to the horizon. Include the grasslands and their seasonal changes, the peoples who roam or farm them, and the sense of endless space. Plains should feel like places of freedom and exposure—nowhere to hide, but room to breathe.

Stretching for hundreds of miles, this region is the breadbasket of the continent and the home of the famed "Horse Lords."
