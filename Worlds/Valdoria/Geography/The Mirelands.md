# The Mirelands

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a region, create a distinct area with unified geographic, cultural, or political character. Include its terrain, climate, settlements, and the peoples who inhabit it. Regions should feel like coherent places with their own identity while fitting into the larger continent.

## Overview
The Mirelands are a vast, festering expanse of swamp, marsh, and bog in the southeastern lowlands of [[Thondorian]]. It is a place of heat, humidity, and disease, where the water is stagnant and the vegetation is aggressive. Civilization shuns this place, leaving it to the ancient Lizardfolk tribes, hags, and desperate outcasts. Legends say a sunken city lies at its heart, filled with gold and the restless dead.
