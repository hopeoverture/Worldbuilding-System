# The Pale North

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a tundra, create a frozen landscape of harsh beauty—permafrost beneath, brief summers, and endless winters. Include the hardy life that survives here, the peoples adapted to the cold, and the dangers of the frozen wastes. Tundras should feel isolated and unforgiving yet hauntingly beautiful.

## Overview
The Pale North is a harsh, unforgiving expanse of ice and snow at the top of the world. It is a land of eternal winter, where the sun barely rises for half the year and the aurora borealis dances in the sky. Home to hardy Raider Clans, frost giants, and ancient ice-bound horrors, it is the anvil upon which the strongest warriors of [[Thondorian]] are forged.
