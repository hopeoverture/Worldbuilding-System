# The Sundered Peaks

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a mountain range, create a dramatic natural barrier with distinct peaks, passes, and character. Include the geology, the peoples who live in or near the mountains, and the dangers they contain. Mountain ranges should feel imposing and consequential—shaping weather, trade, and politics.

## Overview
The Sundered Peaks are the jagged, imposing spine of [[Thondorian]], running north to south and effectively dividing the continent in two. They are mountains of legend—impossibly tall, sharp, and treacherous. Beneath them lie the ancient [[Dwarven Holds]] and the [[Deep Roads]], while their snow-capped summits are the domain of dragons and giants. They were raised by the Architects to mark the seals of the Prison, and magic still clings to them like mist.

## Classification

### Type
**Mountain Type:** Fold / Magical Uplift

### Age
**Geological Age:** Ancient but sharp (Unnaturally preserved)

### Scale
**Length:** 1,200 miles
**Width:** 200 miles average
**Highest Elevation:** 24,000 ft (Mount Titan)

## Physical Features

### Major Peaks
| Peak | Elevation | Notable For |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Zirakzigil** (Silvertine) | 24,000 ft | Highest point, ruins at summit |
| **Bundushathûr** (Cloudyhead) | 18,000 ft | Defies gravity, floats slightly |
| **Amon Uilos** (Everwhite) | 20,000 ft | Ancient dragon nesting ground |

### Passes
| Pass | Elevation | Connects | Difficulty |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **The High Pass** | 8,000 ft | West to East Frontier | High (Snows) |
| **The Dwarf-Gate** | Underground | West to East | Moderate (Tolls) |

### Caves & Caverns
Honeycombed with the **Deep Roads** and entrances to the **Underdark**.

## Geology

### Formation
Magically raised during the Sealing to weigh down the earth over the Imprisoned.

### Minerals & Ores
Rich in Iron, Gold, Mithral, and Gems. The source of the continent's mineral wealth.

## Climate & Weather

### Climate Zones
Alpine and Tundra at altitude. Bitterly cold winds scream through the peaks.

### Dangers
- **Avalanches:** Frequent and deadly.
- **Thin Air:** Altitude sickness.
- **Wild Magic Storms:** Near the peaks.

## Wildlife

### Common
Mountain Goats, Snow Leopards, Giant Eagles.

### Monsters
- **Dragons:** Red (South), White (North), Copper/Silver (Central).
- **Giants:** Stone and Frost giants.
- **Wyverns:** Common aerial predator.

## Inhabitants

### Mountain Peoples
| People | Location | Lifestyle |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Dwarves** | Underground | Mining, Crafting |
| **Goliaths** | High Peaks | Tribal, Competitive |
| **Kobolds** | Caverns | Servants of dragons |

### Settlements
| Settlement | Type | Population |
|------------|------|------------|
| [[Ironhold]] | Dwarven City | 200,000 (Underground) |
| [[Highkeep]] | Human Fort | 2,000 |

## Strategic Importance

### As a Barrier
Separates the "Civilized" West from the "Wild" East. Only a few passes allow trade.

### Passes & Control
Controlled by the **Dwarven Holds**. They charge heavy tolls, making them wealthy and politically neutral.

## History

### Major Events
| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| The Rising | Mythic Age | Mountains created |
| The Dragon Wars | 1,000 years ago | Dwarves vs Dragons |

## Cultural Significance

### In Religion
Peoples believe the gods live on the highest peaks (they don't, but the view is nice).

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Sleeping Dragon:** An ancient red dragon is waking up.
2. **The Lost Hold:** A dwarven city went silent weeks ago.
3. **The Summit Run:** A competition to climb Mount Titan for a prize.
