# The Sunken Library

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A massive library from the Age of Myth that sank when the Elven capital fell. It is now partially flooded, filled with waterproof scrolls, magical automata that still clean the shelves, and dangerous things from the river.

## Overview
Legends say the Archive held all the knowledge of the First Age. When [[Ost-in-Edhil]] fell, the library sank into the silt. Now, beneath the bustling streets of Rivergard, adventurers dive into the murk to recover lost spells. But the library has its own defenses—and some books do not want to be read.

## Key Areas
1.  **The Reading Room:** A vast hall with a glass dome (now cracked and leaking). Schools of glowing fish swim through the air.
2.  **The Stacks:** Miles of watertight metal tubes containing scrolls.
3.  **The Restricted Section:** Dry air-pockets protected by golems.

## Hazards
- **The Librarian:** A malfunction construct that violently "shushes" intruders (by crushing them).
- **Drowning:** Many rooms are fully submerged.
- **The Black Lotus:** They have a secret entrance and use the upper levels as a stash.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Lost Spell:** The Arcane Synod hires the party to find a specific ritual to cure the Plague of Silence.
2.  **The Flood:** Something in the library has opened a floodgate, threatening to sink a district of Rivergard.

## Image Prompts
### Interior
**Prompt:** An underwater library hall. Pillars of white marble, shelves filled with glowing tubes. Light filters down from the water surface above. A large mechanical golem stands guard. Bioluminescent atmosphere.
