# The Valdris Vale

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a region, create a distinct area with unified geographic, cultural, or political character. Include its terrain, climate, settlements, and the peoples who inhabit it. Regions should feel like coherent places with their own identity while fitting into the larger continent.

## Overview
The Valdris Vale is the civilized heart of [[Thondorian]], a wide, fertile valley carved by the mighty [[Valdris]] River. Flanked by the [[The Greenfields]] to the south and hills to the north, it is the center of trade, agriculture, and high culture. Rich city-states and small kingdoms line the riverbanks, united by the "River Compact" to ensure free trade. It is a land of castles, stone bridges, and manicured fields—the safest place in a dangerous world.
