# The Whisperwood

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> When generating a forest, create a distinct woodland with its own character, ecology, and mysteries. Include the types of trees, the creatures within, and any settlements or dangers. Forests should feel alive—either welcoming refuges or dark, dangerous places where civilization ends.

## Overview
The Whisperwood is an ancient, sprawling forest that dominates the central-eastern expanse of [[Thondorian]]. It is a place of towering silver-barked trees, bioluminescent flora, and an ever-present, hushed whispering carried on the wind—said to be the voices of the trees themselves or the fey spirits that dwell within. Humans enter only the fringes; the deep woods belong to the old magic and the remnants of the Elven Dominion.
