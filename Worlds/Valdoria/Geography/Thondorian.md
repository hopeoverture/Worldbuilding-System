# Thondorian

> [!quote] The Land of Stone and Wood
> *"From the frozen capes of the north to the smoldering mountains of the south, from the endless western sea to the marshes where the sun rises—this is Thondorian. A land of ancient ruins and young kingdoms, where the bones of empires sleep beneath the roots of forests that remember the Architects themselves."*
> — Geographic Survey of the Known World, Author Unknown

## Overview
Thondorian is a continent of temperate forests and rolling hills, scarred by the passage of ages and dotted with the ruins of civilizations that rose and fell before living memory. A central mountain spine—the Sundered Peaks—divides the fertile river valleys of the west from the wilder frontier lands of the east. Civilization clusters along the great rivers and coastlines while untamed wilderness holds secrets from ages past. The continent is mostly surrounded by sea, with island chains and a land bridge connecting it to other lands. Here the seals that bind the Imprisoned were placed; here the fate of the world will be decided.

## Classification

### Scale
**Size:** Small — Comparable to Western Europe or Australia

**Compared To:** Roughly the size of Western Europe, taking about two months to cross on foot from coast to coast under good conditions.

### Position
**Hemisphere:** Northern, spanning from subarctic in the far north to temperate-Mediterranean in the south.

**Ocean Borders:**
- **The Vast Sea** (West) — Open ocean stretching to legendary distant lands
- **The Sunrise Water** (East) — Shallower sea leading to island chains and other continents
- **The Frozen Deep** (North) — Arctic waters, largely impassable
- **The Warm Current** (South) — Connects to the Volcanic Isles

## Physical Geography

> [!info] Continental Map


### Shape & Extent
Thondorian is roughly oval, wider in its northern half and tapering toward a peninsula in the south. The Sundered Peaks run north-south through the eastern third of the continent, creating a natural division between the settled west and wilder east. Great rivers flow from the mountains toward both coasts, with the western rivers supporting the most populous regions.

### Major Landforms

### Climate Zones
| Zone | Region | Characteristics |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Subarctic | The Pale North | Long winters, brief summers, permafrost, aurora |
| Temperate Maritime | Western coast | Mild, rainy, foggy; good for farming |
| Continental Temperate | Central heartland | Four distinct seasons; hot summers, cold winters |
| Mediterranean | Southern peninsula | Warm, dry summers; mild winters |
| Highland | Sundered Peaks | Cold, thin air; alpine conditions |
| Swamp | The Mirelands | Humid, wet year-round; oppressive summers |

### Natural Wonders
Extraordinary geographic features:
- **The Shattered Valley** — A place where reality is visibly warped; one of the seal locations
- **The Titan's Bones** — A mountain that looks like a fallen giant; ancient mystery
- **The Moonpool** — A lake that reflects starlight even during the day
- **Lake Anar** — The source of the Valdris, impossibly deep and perfectly clear

### Natural Resources
**Abundant:**
- Timber (Whisperwood and northern forests)
- Iron and copper (Sundered Peaks foothills)
- Fertile farmland (river valleys and Greenfields)
- Fish (coastal waters)
- Coal (eastern mountains)

**Scarce:**
- Precious gems (mostly controlled by dwarves)
- Rare magical components (depleted by ages of use)
- Gold (few deposits remain after ancient mining)

## Regions

### Major Regions
| Region | Terrain | Climate | Controlling Power |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| [[The Westmark]] | Coastal hills, farmland | Maritime temperate | Kingdom (to be named) |
| [[The Greenfields]] | Rolling plains, grassland | Continental | Horse lords confederation |
| [[The Whisperwood]] | Ancient forest | Temperate | Unclaimed / Elven remnants |
| [[The Valdris Vale]] | River valley | Continental | Multiple kingdoms along river |
| [[The Sundered Peaks]] | Mountains, alpine | Highland | Dwarven holds, dragons |
| [[The Mirelands]] | Swamp, wetland | Humid subtropical | Contested / Lizardfolk |
| [[The Pale North]] | Tundra, ice | Subarctic | Raider clans |
| [[The Ashlands]] | Volcanic, barren | Mediterranean (hot) | City-states |
| [[The Eastern Frontier]] | Mixed wilderness | Continental | Unsettled / Frontier towns |

### Regional Divisions
How inhabitants divide the continent:
- **The Civilized Lands** — Western coast and river valleys; safe, settled, governed
- **The Frontier** — Eastern regions beyond the mountains; opportunity and danger
- **The Wilds** — Whisperwood, Mirelands, Pale North; places civilization doesn't go
- **The Depths** — Underground realm; dwarven territory

### Contested Territories
Disputed or lawless areas:
- **The Mirelands** — Multiple powers claim portions; none hold them
- **The Eastern Frontier** — No central authority; frontier law only
- **The Mountain Passes** — Dwarves control; others pay tolls or fight

## Civilizations

### Dominant Powers
| Nation/Empire | Government | Population | Territory |
|---------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| (To be detailed) | Monarchy | ~3 million | Westmark |
| (To be detailed) | Monarchy | ~2.5 million | Valdris Vale |
| [[The Greenfield Confederation]] | Tribal confederation | ~1 million | The Greenfields |
| [[The Dwarven Holds]] | Council of Thanes | ~500,000 | Sundered Peaks depths |

### Minor Powers
- Various city-states along the coasts
- Independent fortress-towns on the frontier
- The Ashland city-states (volcanic south)
- Northern raider kingdoms

### Fallen Empires
Former great powers whose ruins dot the landscape:
- **The First Kingdom** — Founded after the Architects departed; fell in the Mage Wars
- **The Valdorian Empire** — United the continent once; collapsed five centuries ago
- **The Elven Dominion** — Retreated to the Whisperwood and beyond millennia ago

### Indigenous Peoples
Original inhabitants:
- Elves (oldest remaining, mostly departed)
- Dwarves (claim to have been created by the Architects themselves)
- Various human tribes predating kingdoms
- Lizardfolk of the Mirelands (possibly older than humans)

### Population Distribution
People concentrate in river valleys (easy farming, trade), along coasts (fishing, maritime trade), and in the Greenfields (grazing, agriculture). Mountains and deep forests are sparsely populated. The Mirelands and Pale North are nearly empty of civilized folk.

## Political Landscape

### Current Balance of Power
The western kingdoms maintain an uneasy peace through marriage alliances and trade agreements, united primarily by fear of the frontier threats and occasional northern raids. The Dwarven Holds remain neutral in surface affairs but control vital mountain passes. The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth secretly spreads through all courts, manipulating toward war.

### Major Alliances
- **The River Compact** — Trade alliance of Valdris Vale kingdoms
- **Alliance of the Sunset Shore** — Coastal defense pact
- **The Greenfield Brotherhood** — Horse lord tribal bonds

### Ongoing Conflicts
- **Border skirmishes** along the eastern frontier (multiple claimants, no resolution)
- **Northern raids** into settled lands (seasonal threat)
- **Dwarven-surface tensions** over mining rights in foothills

### Neutral Zones
- **The Whisperwood** — No power claims jurisdiction; ancient treaties apply
- **The Great River** — By treaty, the Valdris is open to all for trade
- **The Septenary Temples** — Religious sites are neutral ground

## Economy

### Trade Networks
Trade flows primarily along the Valdris River and the coastal shipping lanes. The mountain passes controlled by dwarves connect east and west, with heavy tolls. Southern volcanic products are valuable but dangerous to transport.

### Major Trade Goods
| Good | Source Region | Destination |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Grain | Greenfields, Valdris Vale | Cities, North |
| Timber | Westmark, frontier forests | Shipyards, cities |
| Ore | Sundered Peaks foothills | Craftsmen everywhere |
| Fish | Coastal waters | Inland settlements |
| Volcanic minerals | Ashlands | Alchemists, smiths |
| Horses | Greenfields | Military, nobility |
| Dwarven craft | Sundered Peaks | Wealthy buyers |

### Economic Centers
- Major port cities on the Sunset Shore
- Dwarven trade halls at mountain pass entrances
- River cities along the Valdris
- Ashland trading posts for volcanic products

### Currencies
- **Imperial Crowns** — Old Valdorian coins still widely accepted
- **Kingdom-specific coins** — Various, exchangeable at money changers
- **Dwarven trade bars** — Standardized metal bars for large transactions

## Culture

### Cultural Families
Related groups of peoples:
- **Coastal Folk** — Maritime culture, traders and fishers
- **River People** — Agricultural, settled, traders
- **Plain Riders** — Nomadic horse culture, warriors
- **Mountain Folk** — Hardy, insular, miners and herders
- **Northern Clans** — Raiders and survivors, tough and proud

### Shared Traditions
Continental customs:
- The number seven is sacred (days of week, gods, seals)
- Midwinter and Midsummer festivals are nearly universal
- Hospitality customs protect travelers (one night of shelter)
- The dead are honored; disturbing graves is taboo

### Religious Landscape
The Seven are worshipped everywhere, with regional emphasis:
- Coastals favor Nindariel (storms, sea)
- Farmers pray to Yavandil (harvest)
- Warriors honor Oromir (war, craft)
- Scholars follow Silmarwen (knowledge)

The Covenant secretly spreads a new "truth" that undermines traditional faith.

### Languages
- **Common Valdorian** — Descended from Imperial tongue; universal trade language
- **Old Valdorian** — Scholarly, religious, legal documents
- **Regional dialects** — Vary by kingdom but mutually intelligible
- **Dwarven** — Spoken by dwarves; trade pidgins exist
- **Elvish (Sindarin-derived)** — Rare; scholarly and magical use

## History

### Geological History
Thondorian was shaped by cosmic forces during the world's creation. The Sundered Peaks rose when the Architects carved the prison for the Imprisoned, pushing up mountains to mark and protect the seal locations. The volcanic south formed from the heat of their workings. Rivers carved their courses over millennia, guided by forces both natural and magical.

### Ancient History
First civilizations and lost empires:
- **The Age of Dawn** — The Architects shape the world; the Imprisoned is sealed
- **The First Peoples** — Elves and dwarves walk the land before humans arrive
- **The First Kingdoms** — Humans build the earliest nations
- **The Mage Wars** — Magical conflict devastates civilizations; anti-magic laws follow

### Major Historical Events
| Era | Event | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Mythic Age | The Sealing | The Imprisoned bound; mountains raised; world shaped |
| ~3,000 years ago | First Speaking | The Seven begin communicating with mortals |
| ~2,800 years ago | Binding of the Eighth | A god cast out; empty throne remains |
| ~2,000 years ago | The Mage Wars | Magical devastation; persecution begins |
| ~500 years ago | Fall of Valdorian Empire | Continental unity ends; current kingdoms form |
| ~300 years ago | Sealing of Seraphine | Last known reinforcement of seals |
| ~10 years ago | The Silence Begins | Divine communication weakens |
| Present | The Awakening | Seals fail; the Imprisoned stirs |

### Current Era
Thondorian stands at a crossroads. The old kingdoms maintain their rituals and rivalries while beneath the surface, ancient evil stirs. The Covenant spreads its poison through courts and temples. Three seals have weakened, and priests receive no divine guidance. The few who perceive the danger are called mad—or silenced. Heroes are needed who can walk where gods cannot go.

## Dangers

### Environmental Hazards
Continental-scale threats:
- Magical instability near the Sundered Peaks (wild magic, reality warps)
- Harsh winters in the Pale North

- **The Peaks** — Dragons, giants, flying predators
- **The Whisperwood** — Fey creatures, awakened plants, ancient things
- **The Mirelands** — Hydras, lizardfolk, undead
- **The Depths** — Aberrations, drow, worse things below

### Cursed Lands
Magically corrupted areas:
- **The Shattered Valley** — Near a failing seal; reality warps
- **Old Mage War battlefields** — Residual magical contamination
- **Certain ruins** — Places where forbidden magic was practiced

### Political Dangers
War zones, lawless regions:
- **The Frontier** — No law but strength
- **Border regions** — Kingdom tensions spill into violence
- **Coastal waters** — Pirates and raiders

- The Architects of Dawn (mythic creators)
- The Imprisoned (the enemy beneath)

## Secrets

1. **The Seventh Seal's Location** — The seventh seal exists as the collective faith of the people; it has no physical location but manifests wherever belief is strongest.

2. **The Deep Roads' True Extent** — The dwarven tunnels connect to the Prison's outer shell; the dwarves know but speak nothing.

3. **The Covenant's True Center** — The Covenant's hidden leadership operates from a temple in one of the major capitals, hiding in plain sight among the faithful.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Shattered Valley Expedition** — Scholars need escorts to study the warped reality near a failing seal. What they find may change everything.

2. **The Bridging** — Something is building a connection between the Shadowfell and the Prison. Heroes must sever it before the Imprisoned gains a new avenue of corruption.

3. **The Last Thane** — A dwarven thane knows the truth about the Deep Roads and the Prison. He dies before he can speak—murdered. His journal contains clues.

4. **The False Temple** — A major Septenary Temple has been entirely replaced by Covenant operatives. The true priests are held below. Can heroes expose the truth without sparking religious war?
