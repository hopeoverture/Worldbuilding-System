# The Age of Myth

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The era before the fall. Gods walked the earth, cities floated in the sky, and magic was wild and free. It ended in tragedy.

## Overview
The Age of Myth was a time when the veil between the mortal world and the divine was thin. It began with [[The Song of Creation]], when the gods sang Thondorian into existence. Great civilizations arose, mastering arts now lost. It was a time of wonder, but also of hubris.

## Major Events
1.  **The Song of Creation:** The beginning of all things.
2.  **The Founding of the First Cities:** [[Karak-Zul]] and the lost elven capitals were built.
3.  **The Binding of the Shackled God:** The gods imprisoned the dark brother deep beneath the earth.

## The End
The Age ended with [[The Betrayal]], when mortals (or a traitor god) sought to usurp the power of the divine, breaking the world and silencing the Song.
