# The Age of Myth

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The era before the fall—when gods walked the earth, cities floated in the sky, and magic flowed as freely as water. It began with the Song of Creation and ended in the catastrophe of the Betrayal. This was the golden age that all subsequent ages remember with longing and attempt to reclaim.

## Overview

The Age of Myth was a time when the boundary between mortal and divine barely existed. It began when the Seven Gods sang Thondorian into existence, their voices weaving the fabric of reality itself. During this era, the gods walked among their creations, granting blessings directly, teaching magic personally, and shaping civilizations with their own hands. Great wonders arose—the floating citadels of the elves, the deep-delved halls of the dwarves, the crystal towers of the first human kingdoms—all powered by magic now lost. It was an age of miracles, but also of hubris, for the mortals who lived in paradise forgot that even paradise can fall. The age ended when the Betrayal shattered the divine order, silenced the Song, and cast the world into shadow.

## Classification

### Type
**Age Type:** Golden Age / Age of Magic

**Defining Characteristic:** The gods were present and active, magic was abundant and wild, and mortality itself was negotiable for those favored by the divine.

### Duration
**Length:** Unknown—time was measured differently, and the calendars of this age are lost. Estimates range from three to ten thousand years.

**Position in History:** Ancient (The First Age of civilized existence)

## Chronological Boundaries

### Beginning
**Event That Started It:** [[The Song of Creation]]

**Date:** Before time was counted

**Why This Marks the Start:**
The Song of Creation was the literal beginning—before it, there was only void and potential. When the Seven Gods joined their voices, they sang the world into being: the mountains rose with bass notes, the seas flowed from melodic phrases, and life itself emerged from harmonies too beautiful for mortal ears to comprehend. This divine music established the fundamental laws of reality.

### End
**Event That Ended It:** [[The Betrayal]]

**Date:** Approximately 3,000 years before the present day

**Why This Marks the End:**
The Betrayal shattered everything the Age of Myth represented. Whether through mortal hubris or divine treachery (the records conflict), someone attempted to seize the power of the Song itself. The resulting catastrophe killed or banished most of the gods, broke the great civilizations, sank entire continents, and created the Imprisoned—the Shackled God who now strains against his chains. The divine music fell silent, and the world has been slowly dying ever since.

### Transition Periods
**From Previous Age:** None—the Age of Myth was the first age. Before it, only the gods existed.

**To Following Age:** The Sundering, a period of chaos lasting approximately 500 years, during which survivors struggled to rebuild amid ongoing magical disasters.

## Defining Characteristics

### Primary Features
What made this age distinct:

1. **Divine Presence:** The gods walked among mortals, taught them, blessed them, and occasionally punished them directly.
2. **Abundant Magic:** Magic was as natural as breathing; even common folk could work minor wonders.
3. **Immortal Elves:** The Elder Race did not age during this period, and the greatest among them could reshape reality.
4. **Great Works:** Cities floated, mountains were moved, and artifacts of impossible power were crafted.
5. **United Purpose:** The mortal races generally cooperated, united in worship of the Seven and opposition to primordial chaos.

### Prevalent Themes
| Theme | Expression | Impact |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Divine Guidance | Gods as teachers and rulers | Mortals achieved wonders but never developed independence |
| Unlimited Potential | Magic without limits | Great achievements, but also great catastrophes |
| Paradise | Want was unknown; death was optional | Hubris grew as mortals forgot their mortality |
| Unity | Races cooperated under divine guidance | Bonds that echo today in legends of friendship |

### Atmosphere/Mood
Life during the Age of Myth was one of wonder, security, and purpose. Death from natural causes was rare—healing magic was freely available. War was almost unknown—the gods maintained peace. The greatest struggles were artistic competitions and philosophical debates. Yet beneath this paradise lurked the seeds of doom: mortals who had never truly suffered began to resent their dependence on the divine, and some whispered that they could do better alone.

### What Made It Unique
The Age of Myth stands alone in history because it was the only time when the barrier between mortal and divine did not exist. The gods were not distant figures to be worshipped through faith—they were present beings who answered prayers in person, who could be met on the road, who sometimes fell in love with mortals. This intimacy created civilization but also the conditions for its destruction.

## Major Events Timeline

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| The Beginning | The Song of Creation | The world is sung into existence |
| Early Age | The Shaping of the Races | Gods create elves, dwarves, humans, and others |
| Middle Age | The Building of the Great Cities | Floating citadels, deep holds, and crystal towers rise |
| Middle Age | The Binding of the Eighth | The dark god is imprisoned beneath the world |
| Late Age | The Growing Silence | Gods begin withdrawing, speaking less often |
| The End | The Betrayal | Catastrophe ends the age |

## Detailed Event Descriptions

### The Song of Creation
**Date:** The Beginning

**Summary:**
The Seven Gods—beings of pure creative force—joined their voices in harmony to sing the world into existence. Each god contributed their unique aspect: order, chaos, life, death, knowledge, mystery, and balance. The Song established not just the physical world but the fundamental laws of reality, including the possibility of magic.

**Impact:**
All magic in Valdoria ultimately derives from echoes of the Song. The greatest mages of the Age of Myth could hear faint traces of it; no mage since the Betrayal has managed even that.

### The Shaping of the Races
**Date:** Early Age

**Summary:**
The gods created the mortal races as partners in the ongoing work of creation. Elves were shaped from starlight and given long lives to pursue perfection. Dwarves were carved from mountain stone and given skill with craft. Humans were woven from potential itself and given adaptability. Other races followed—halflings from joy, gnomes from curiosity, and darker beings from shadow.

**Impact:**
The races were meant to complement each other, each reflecting different aspects of the divine. This design explains both the natural affinities between races and the tensions that emerged when divine guidance ended.

### The Binding of the Eighth
**Date:** Middle Age

**Summary:**
Not all beings that existed in the void accepted the Song's order. The Eighth—a god of entropy, dissolution, and ending—sought to unravel what the Seven had sung. Unable to destroy their sibling, the Seven bound the Eighth beneath the world, creating the First Seal and establishing the Citadel of Tears as its guardian. The Imprisoned was forgotten by most, becoming the Shackled God of whispered rumors.

**Impact:**
The prison holds to this day, though the seals weaken. The Cult of the Shackled God seeks to complete what the Eighth began.

### The Betrayal
**Date:** The End

**Summary:**
The exact nature of the Betrayal is lost to history—records were destroyed, and survivors remember it differently. Some say a mortal mage attempted to steal the power of the Song. Others say one of the Seven betrayed the others. What is known: the divine music stopped, the gods fell silent or vanished, catastrophes swept the world, and the Age of Myth ended in fire and darkness.

**Impact:**
Everything that followed—the Age of Shadows, the decline of magic, the weakening of the seals—traces back to this moment. Understanding what actually happened in the Betrayal might be the key to saving or dooming the world.

## Key Figures

### Defining Figures
| Figure | Role | Era Active | Lasting Impact |
|--------|------|------------|----------------|
| The Seven Gods | Creators | Entire Age | Created reality itself; worshipped still |
| High King Celeborn | Elven ruler | Late Age | United the elves; led the defense during the Betrayal |
| The First Dwarf | Founder of Karak-Zul | Early Age | Established dwarven culture and craft |
| The Unnamed Betrayer | Unknown | The End | Caused the catastrophe; identity debated |

### Heroes of the Age
1. **Celeborn the Radiant:** Elven High King who held the elven lands together during the Betrayal's aftermath.
2. **Grimm Stone-Father:** First High King of the dwarves, who delved the Deep Roads.
3. **Aelindra the Healer:** Human priestess who supposedly healed entire kingdoms during the Sundering.

### Villains of the Age
1. **The Unnamed Betrayer:** Whoever caused the catastrophe, whether mortal or divine.
2. **The Eighth (The Imprisoned):** The dark god whose binding defined the age's middle period.

### Lost to History
- The names of most mortal mages who served the gods directly
- The human kingdoms' original rulers
- The architects of the floating citadels

## Powers & Nations

### Dominant Powers
| Power | Height | Influence | Fate |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|
| The Elven Empire | Middle Age | Continental | Shattered; survivors retreated to Whisperwood |
| The Dwarven Holds | Entire Age | Underground network | Reduced but surviving |
| The First Human Kingdoms | Late Age | Regional | Completely destroyed |

### Rising Powers
Powers that emerged or grew during this age:
- Human civilizations (rapid expansion in the Late Age)
- The temples of the Seven (religious influence grew as gods withdrew)

### Declining Powers
Powers that fell or weakened:
- Direct divine rule (as gods gradually withdrew)
- The Elder Dragons (most departed or slumbered by the Late Age)

### Power Shifts
The Age of Myth saw a gradual shift from direct divine rule to mortal autonomy. Early in the age, the gods managed everything directly. By the end, mortal kings and councils made most decisions, with the gods offering guidance rather than commands. This shift may have enabled the Betrayal.

## Cultural Developments

### Arts & Expression
Art during the Age of Myth was inseparable from magic. Sculptures sang, paintings moved, and poems could literally change reality. The greatest works were collaborative efforts between mortal artists and divine patrons.

### Philosophy & Thought
Philosophy focused on understanding divine purpose and one's role in the cosmic order. The concept of rebelling against the gods was nearly unthinkable—until someone did.

### Religion & Spirituality
Religion was not faith but relationship. You didn't believe in the gods; you talked to them. Temples were meeting places, not sites of worship. This intimacy made the gods' later silence all the more devastating.

### Social Changes
Society was hierarchical but benevolent—the gods at the top, their chosen servants below, and ordinary mortals at the bottom. But everyone's needs were met, so few resented the structure.

### Daily Life
Ordinary people lived lives of comfort unknown since. Disease was cured by simple prayer. Crops never failed. Monsters were rare and quickly handled. The greatest hardship was boredom—which may explain why some sought forbidden knowledge.

## Technological Level

### Key Technologies
| Technology | Status | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Magic-based construction | Common | Cities floated, buildings grew, mountains moved |
| Divine healing | Universal | Death from illness or injury was nearly unknown |
| Teleportation networks | Established | Travel between distant locations was trivial |
| Artifact creation | Perfected | Items of immense power were routinely crafted |

### Innovations
- The Floating Citadels (elven)
- The Deep Roads (dwarven)
- Crystal Tower architecture (human)
- Living magic (spells that sustained themselves indefinitely)

### Lost Technologies
After the Betrayal, nearly all was lost:
- The secret of floating architecture
- Divine healing (no longer answered reliably)
- Teleportation (networks collapsed)
- Artifact creation (methods forgotten or corrupted)

### Magical Developments
Magic during the Age of Myth required no study—it was breathed, felt, intuited. The structured magic of the current age (spell slots, components, formulae) was developed after the Betrayal as a way to access the fading traces of the Song.

## Conflicts

### Major Wars
| War | Parties | Duration | Outcome |
|-----|---------|----------|---------|
| The Binding War | Seven Gods vs. The Eighth | Unknown | The Eighth was imprisoned |
| The Dragon Withdrawal | Mortals vs. Elder Dragons | Centuries | Dragons departed or slumbered |

### Defining Battles
| Battle | Date | Significance |
|--------|------|--------------|
| The Battle of the First Seal | Middle Age | The Eighth was bound |
| The Last Stand of Celeborn | The Betrayal | Elven king's sacrifice saved survivors |

### Ideological Struggles
- Divine guidance vs. mortal autonomy (growing tension throughout the age)
- Order vs. chaos (the Eighth represented ultimate dissolution)

### Internal Conflicts
Remarkably few. The gods' presence suppressed most serious conflict. This may have prevented mortals from developing the resilience needed to survive the Betrayal.

## Geography

### World State
The world during the Age of Myth was far larger and more connected. Continents existed that have since sunk. The polar regions were temperate. The Ashlands were fertile plains. The entire world was a garden.

### Territorial Changes
- The Deep Roads connected all dwarven holds beneath the entire continent
- Elven waylines linked their floating citadels in a network across the world
- Human kingdoms spread across lands now wilderness

### Lost Lands
- The Sunken Continent (destroyed in the Betrayal)
- The Floating Citadels (fell from the sky)
- The Western Reaches (now beneath the sea)

### Discovered Lands
All lands were known and mapped during this age. Discovery was not a theme—the world was fully explored.

### Environmental Changes
The Betrayal caused massive environmental destruction:
- Climate shifted colder
- Magic-sustained ecosystems collapsed
- Entire regions became wastelands or sank beneath the waves

## How It Ended

### Final Events
The Betrayal struck without warning. One moment, the world was at peace; the next, the sky cracked, the Song fell silent, and fire rained from the heavens. The floating citadels plummeted. The Deep Roads collapsed in sections. The seas rose and swallowed entire kingdoms. The gods screamed in pain or rage or sorrow—and then they were gone, leaving only silence where their voices had been.

### Transition Period
**Duration:** The Sundering lasted approximately 500 years.

**Characteristics:** Chaos, survival, the loss of most magical knowledge, and the gradual emergence of new nations from the ruins.

### What Changed
1. Divine presence ended; the gods no longer walked among mortals
2. Magic became rare and unreliable
3. The mortal races were thrown on their own resources
4. Much knowledge was lost forever

### What Carried Forward
- Worship of the Seven (now through faith rather than presence)
- Some artifacts and ruins (most corrupted or broken)
- Racial memories and cultural fragments
- The Imprisoned beneath the Citadel of Tears

## Legacy

### How Remembered
**By the Elves:** With grief—they remember the age personally, having lived through it.

**By the Dwarves:** With determination—they seek to rebuild what was lost.

**By Humans:** With longing—they know it only through legend and ache for a paradise they never experienced.

**By the Cults:** As proof that the current order is unnatural and should be ended.

### Lasting Impact
- All current religions trace to the Age of Myth
- All powerful artifacts date from this era
- The Imprisoned's chains were forged then and weaken now
- The very shape of the world (missing continents, changed climates) reflects the Betrayal

### Lessons Learned
- Trust in the gods was rewarded—until it wasn't
- Magic is power, and power corrupts
- Paradise cannot last (a bitter truth)

### Nostalgia vs Reality
People remember the Age of Myth as perfect, but the late age saw growing tensions, withdrawal of divine guidance, and the conditions that enabled the Betrayal. Paradise was already fading before it fell.

### Physical Remnants
- Ruins throughout Valdoria (most dangerous, corrupted, or guarded)
- Artifacts (rare, powerful, often cursed)
- The seals binding the Imprisoned
- The altered geography itself

## Secrets

1. The identity of the Betrayer has been deliberately concealed by surviving powers who fear what might happen if the truth were known.
2. Some of the Seven survived the Betrayal but are imprisoned, exiled, or hiding—they could potentially be contacted or freed.
3. The Song of Creation was not destroyed but merely silenced; it could theoretically be restored, restarting the age.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Last Echo:** A mage discovers a way to hear the final moments of the Song—including the Betrayer's name.
2. **The Fallen Citadel:** An elven floating city is found mostly intact in a remote location; its secrets could revolutionize magic.
3. **The Prisoner's Testimony:** The Imprisoned claims to know the truth of the Betrayal and offers to share it—for a price.
4. **The Seventh Seal:** Ancient records suggest a seventh seal exists beyond the known six—one that could release or permanently bind the Imprisoned.
