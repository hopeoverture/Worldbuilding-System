# The Age of Shadows

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The current era. A time of crumbling ruins, dangerous wilderness, and fear of magic. The gods are distant, and the memory of the Golden Age is fading into legend.

## Overview
We live in the long twilight of the world. Since [[The Betrayal]], the great powers have been broken. [[The Kingdom of Aerendor]] fades in the west, and the shadow of [[The Shackled God]] stretches longer each year. It is a time for heroes, for only they can hold back the dark.

## Major Events
1.  **The Rise of the Iron Holds:** Dwarves seal themselves deep underground.
2.  **The Retreat of the Elves:** The Elder Race withdraws to [[The Whisperwood]].
3.  **The Orcish Crusades:** Massive invasions from [[The Ashlands]].
4.  **[[The Plague of Silence]]:** A magical blight that silenced mages.
5.  **[[The False King's War]]:** Civil war in Aerendor.

## Current State
The world is holding its breath. The seals on the Shackled God's prison are weakening.
