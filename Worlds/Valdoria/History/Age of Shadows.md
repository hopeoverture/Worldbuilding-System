# The Age of Shadows

> [!info] Character Summary
> The current era of Valdoria—two thousand years of slow decline since the Betrayal shattered the world's foundations. The gods have grown distant, magic has become feared and rare, and the great civilizations of the Age of Myth have crumbled into isolated kingdoms surrounded by monster-haunted wilderness. Yet in every shadow lies the spark of a hero, and in every ruin waits knowledge that could save or doom the world.

## Overview

We live in the long twilight of the world. Two millennia have passed since [[The Betrayal]] sundered the divine compact and imprisoned the [[The Shackled God|Shackled God]] beneath the earth. The scars of that cataclysm have never healed—continents lie broken, magic flows unpredictably through wounded ley lines, and the gods who once walked among mortals now speak only in whispers and portents. The great empires of the [[Age of Myth]] are dust; in their place rise fragile kingdoms like [[The Kingdom of Aerendor]], merchant republics like [[The River Compact]], and desperate strongholds like [[The Iron Holds]]. The wilderness between these lights of civilization grows darker each generation, filled with monsters, ruins, and forgotten evils stirring in their ancient prisons. Yet this is also an age of heroes, for when the world stands on the brink, it is the brave few who hold back the dark.

## Classification

### Temporal Position
**Preceded By:** [[Age of Myth]] (The Golden Age)

**Followed By:** Unknown (Prophecies speak of either the Age of Restoration or the Age of Chains)

### Duration
**Length:** Approximately 2,000 years, ongoing

**Calendar System:** The Reckoning of Shadows, counted from the year of the Betrayal (Year 1 RS). Current year: 1,987 RS.

### Character
**Overall Tone:** Decline and struggle with glimmers of hope

**Thematic Elements:**
- The weight of forgotten history
- Light persisting against encroaching darkness
- The cost of hubris and the hope of redemption
- Heroes arising from common folk

## Chronological Boundaries

### Beginning
**Triggering Event:** [[The Betrayal]]

**Approximate Date:** Year 1 RS (Reckoning of Shadows)

**Circumstances:** When [[The Shackled God|Vaelthur the Betrayer]] struck down the other gods and was in turn imprisoned, the resulting cataclysm shattered the divine order that had sustained the Age of Myth. The [[Celestial Concordat]] that bound the cosmos was broken. Magic, once as reliable as breathing, became wild and dangerous. The gods retreated to heal their wounds, leaving mortals to face the consequences alone.

### End
**Triggering Event:** Not yet ended—but prophecy speaks of the Breaking of Chains

**Circumstances:** The seals binding the Shackled God weaken with each passing century. The [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] works tirelessly to hasten this release, while the [[Order of the Silver Flame]] and other defenders race to prevent it. The current age will end one of two ways: with the final defeat of the imprisoned god, ushering in an Age of Restoration, or with his release, bringing the prophesied Age of Chains.

## Defining Characteristics

### Primary Features
1. **The Silence of the Gods:** Divine magic still functions, but the gods rarely intervene directly. Prayers are answered through subtle signs and granted powers rather than divine visitation. This has led to widespread religious doubt and the rise of false prophets.

2. **The Fear of Magic:** After witnessing arcane power nearly unmake the world, most civilizations have developed deep suspicion of wizards and sorcerers. Magic-users face persecution in many lands, and arcane knowledge is hoarded in secret towers or banned outright.

3. **The Broken Geography:** The world's very shape was changed by the Betrayal. Continents fractured, creating the Shattered Isles. Mountain ranges rose in moments. The Ashlands were created where fertile plains once stood. Travel between regions is dangerous, isolating communities.

4. **The Monster-Haunted Wilderness:** Creatures twisted by the cataclysm's wild magic, or freed from ancient prisons, now roam lands that were once safe. Most humans live within sight of walls, and roads between settlements require armed escorts.

5. **Lost Knowledge:** The great libraries burned, the immortal teachers died, and each generation knows less than the last. Ruins dot the landscape, holding treasures and dangers that modern folk cannot recreate or safely contain.

### How It Differs
**From Previous Age:** The Age of Myth was an era of wonder, cooperation, and divine presence. Gods walked the earth, all peoples lived in harmony, and magic was a gift freely shared. The Age of Shadows is its mirror—isolation, suspicion, scarcity, and fear.

**From Following Age:** What comes next depends entirely on mortal choices made now. If the Shackled God breaks free, the Age of Chains will be an era of slavery and despair under a mad deity. If he is defeated permanently, the Age of Restoration might see the return of divine guidance and the rebuilding of lost wonders.

| [[The Kingdom of Aerendor]] | Hereditary Monarchy | Declining | Oldest human kingdom, paranoid leadership |
| [[The Iron Holds]] | Elective Monarchy (Thanes) | Defensive | Dwarven confederation, isolated, vengeful |
| [[The River Compact]] | Merchant Republic | Rising | Trade league, neutral, pragmatic |

## Cultural Developments

### Religion
The gods of the [[The Silver Flame|Silver Flame]] are still worshipped, but faith has become more formal and less miraculous. Clerics are the primary evidence that the gods have not abandoned the world entirely, though divine intervention is subtle. The cults of dead or imprisoned gods—particularly the [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]—have grown in the silence, promising power to those who feel abandoned.

### Art & Architecture
The towering spires and delicate beauty of the Age of Myth are beyond modern craft. Current architecture emphasizes defense—thick walls, narrow windows, buildings clustered for mutual protection. Art focuses on religious themes and heroic legends, often depicting idealized versions of the lost Golden Age. The contrast between ancient ruins and modern construction is stark and melancholy.

### Magic
Once a gift, now a curse. Most common folk fear magic-users, and many kingdoms restrict or ban arcane practice. Magical education is rare, often passed secretly from master to apprentice. Divine magic remains acceptable because it comes from the gods, but even clerics face suspicion if they display too much power. The great magical traditions are fragments, their full teachings lost.

### Social Structure
Feudal hierarchies dominate most human lands. The nobility justified their rule through descent from heroes of the early Age of Shadows who protected the common folk. Serfdom is common, though free towns and merchant cities offer alternatives. Dwarves maintain clan-based structures, while elves have become so insular that outsiders know little of their ways.

## Technological Level

### General Level
Late medieval equivalent with remnants of more advanced lost technology

### Notable Technologies

| Technology | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Metallurgy | Advanced (dwarves) | Steel common; mithril and adamantine known but rare |
| Agriculture | Basic | Three-field rotation; struggling to feed populations |
| Medicine | Primitive | Relies heavily on divine healing; plague is devastating |
| Warfare | Medieval | Castles, crossbows, pike formations; siege craft improving |
| Magic | Rare & feared | Once integrated into society; now hidden and restricted |

### Lost Knowledge
- **Teleportation circles** once connected major cities; most are now dormant or dangerous
- **Golem crafting** was common among dwarves; the secret is mostly lost
- **Flying ships** of the elves are legendary; none have been seen in centuries
- **Weather control** maintained perfect harvests; without it, famine is constant threat

## Conflicts

### Major Wars

| Conflict | Period | Combatants | Outcome |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| The Orcish Crusades | Recurring | Civilized races vs. Ashland Hordes | Ongoing; civilized races losing ground |
| [[The False King's War]] | 1947 RS | Eldred II vs. Aldred the Usurper | Eldred victorious; kingdom scarred |
| The Great Siege | 1887 RS | Iron Holds vs. Orc Horde | Pyrrhic dwarven victory; deep halls lost |
| The Mage Purges | ~500 RS | Various kingdoms vs. mages | Mages nearly exterminated |

### Ongoing Tensions

| Conflict | Parties | Current Status |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Covenant Shadow War | Silver Flame vs. Covenant | Secret struggle escalating |
| Dwarven Isolation | Iron Holds vs. surface kingdoms | High King refuses alliance |
| Trade Wars | Aerendor vs. River Compact | Cold economic conflict |
| Monster Incursions | Civilization vs. Wilderness | Losing battle; frontiers shrinking |

## Geography

### How the World Has Changed
The Betrayal physically reshaped Valdoria. The **Shattered Isles** were once a single continent. The **Ashlands** were fertile plains before the cataclysm's fires scoured them. The **Sundered Peaks** rose in moments, splitting what had been unified dwarven territories. Rivers changed course, coastlines shifted, and entire cities sank beneath new seas.

### Important Locations

| Location | Significance | Current State |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| [[The Valdris Vale]] | Heartland of human civilization | Fertile but threatened |
| [[The Sundered Peaks]] | Dwarven homeland | Contested with orcs |
| [[The Whisperwood]] | Elven refuge | Closed to outsiders |
| [[The Ashlands]] | Orc territories | Source of constant raids |
| [[The Prison of the Imprisoned]] | Where the Shackled God lies | Seals weakening |

### Lost Places
Many locations from the Age of Myth are now ruins or have vanished entirely. The great elven cities of the plains are overgrown forests. The human kingdoms of the east are tumbled stones. The shared temples where all races once worshipped together are monster lairs. Adventurers seek these ruins for treasure, but few return from the deepest places.

## How It Ended

### The End Is Not Yet Written
The Age of Shadows has not ended, but all signs point to a coming crisis. The seals on the Shackled God's prison weaken. The Covenant grows bolder. Ancient evils stir in forgotten places. Yet heroes arise in every generation, and the final outcome remains uncertain.

### Prophesied Endings
**The Age of Chains:** If the Shackled God breaks free, he will enslave all creation. The sun will dim, the gods will fall, and mortals will serve in chains forever.

**The Age of Restoration:** If the Shackled God is destroyed or permanently contained, the divine compact might be restored. The gods could return, magic could heal, and the world might see a new golden age.

### What's at Stake
Everything. The choices made in this generation will determine the fate of the world for ages to come.

## Legacy

### What This Age Is Remembered For
Future histories—if there are future histories—will remember the Age of Shadows as the time of testing. Civilization survived despite everything: divine abandonment, magical catastrophe, orc invasions, plague, civil war, and the slow march of entropy. If heroes triumph, this age will be remembered as the crucible that forged a better world. If they fail, no one will be left to remember anything at all.

### Lasting Contributions
- The development of resilient, self-sufficient communities
- The preservation of crucial knowledge against all odds
- The heroes who held the line when all seemed lost
- The institutions (Order of the Silver Flame, Explorers League) that kept hope alive

### Seeds of Future Conflict
- The dwarves' isolation breeds resentment and weakness
- The Covenant's infiltration may already be too deep to purge
- Knowledge needed to defeat the Shackled God may be lost forever
- The fractures between nations may prevent the unity needed to survive

## Secrets

1. The [[The Prophet of Chains]] has learned the location of three of the seven seals and has successfully weakened two.
2. The elves of the Whisperwood know how to repair the divine compact but refuse to share this knowledge with "those who broke it."
3. King Aldric IV of Aerendor did not fail to send troops to the Great Siege—he was prevented by Covenant agents in his court.
4. The true prison of the Shackled God is not underground but in a pocket dimension; what lies beneath is only a connection point.
5. The Plague of Silence was not natural—it was a Covenant weapon testing the boundaries of divine protection.

## Plot Hooks

### For Campaigns Set in This Age
1. **The Final Seal:** The party discovers the location of the seventh and most crucial seal as Covenant forces race to destroy it.
2. **Reclaiming the Deep Roads:** High King Thrain IV offers alliance to any who help reconquer the dwarven ancestral halls—but what waits in the deepest dark?
3. **The Elven Secret:** Rumors suggest the Whisperwood elves know how to permanently destroy the Shackled God; convincing them to share this knowledge requires extraordinary heroism.
4. **The Prophet Unmasked:** A chance to identify and eliminate the Prophet of Chains before the final seal breaks—but can the party trust their own allies?
5. **The Last Library:** Somewhere in the wilderness lies the Library of the First Age, its contents preserved by ancient magic, containing knowledge that could save or doom the world.

### Historical Investigation Hooks
1. **What Really Happened:** The official history of the False King's War hides terrible secrets that still threaten Aerendor.
2. **The First Prophet's Tomb:** Legends say the First Prophet was not executed but entombed alive, still whispering to the faithful.
3. **Before the Betrayal:** Ancient prophecies suggest the Betrayal was itself foretold and could have been prevented—was there a traitor among the gods' mortal servants?
