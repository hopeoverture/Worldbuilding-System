# The Betrayal

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The defining tragedy. A mortal hero (or demigod) tried to steal the power of creation to kill the Shackled God, but instead broke the world.

## Overview
History does not record his true name, only "The Traitor." He sought to wield the Prime Note to destroy evil forever. But mortal hands were not meant to hold such power. The Note shattered the continent, sunk the western lands, and caused the gods to withdraw in grief and horror.

## Consequences
- **The Seals Weakened:** Paradoxically, the attempt to kill the Shackled God only damaged his prison.
- **Magic Corrupted:** Wild magic zones appeared where the Song was discordant.
- **Distrust of Power:** Great heroes are now viewed with suspicion.
