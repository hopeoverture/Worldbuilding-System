# The Bleeding Woods

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A horror-mystery in the deep woods. Something is corrupting the forest spirits, turning them into twisted effigies of bone and sap. The party must find the source before Oakhaven is consumed.

## Overview
[[Elder Thorn]] summons the party. The protective wards around Oakhaven are failing. The "Missing Hunters" returned last night... but they were wrong.
