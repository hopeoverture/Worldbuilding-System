# The False King's War

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A brutal civil war that pitted brother against brother in Aerendor. It depleted the treasury and the army just when the Orcs began to stir again.

## Overview
Twenty years ago, King Eldred's younger brother, Kael, claimed the throne, backed by dark mercenaries and—it is whispered—cult gold. He held the capital for three bloody years before Eldred rallied the lords of the [[The Westmark]] to retake it.

## Consequences
- **Ruined Nobility:** Many ancient houses were wiped out.
- **Mercenary Problem:** Kael's mercenaries fled east to become bandits in [[The Free Towns]].
- **Paranoia:** The King trusts no one, not even his own council.
