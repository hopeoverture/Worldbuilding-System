# The False King's War

> [!info] Character Summary
> The brutal civil war that shattered [[The Kingdom of Aerendor]] and broke the heart of its eventual victor. When King Aldric IV died, his heir Aldred enacted radical reforms that threatened the traditional nobility. His younger brother Eldred was forced to choose between family loyalty and the kingdom's survival. For three blood-soaked years, brother fought brother until Eldred stormed the throne room and killed Aldred with his own hands. He won the crown but lost his soul—the paranoid, suspicious [[King Eldred II]] who rules today was born in that moment of kinslaying. The war's scars have never healed, and the Covenant's shadowy role in the conflict remains a dangerous secret.

## Overview

Forty years ago, the Kingdom of Aerendor tore itself apart. When King Aldric IV died, his eldest son Aldred inherited the throne and immediately began implementing sweeping reforms: dissolving the traditional noble houses, seizing temple lands, and ruling by decree rather than through the established councils. Whether these reforms were idealistic, tyrannical, or influenced by darker forces remains debated. What is certain is that the nobility rebelled, and Aldred's younger brother Eldred—beloved of the common folk and trusted by the traditional lords—became the face of their resistance. For three years the brothers waged war across the heartland of Aerendor, burning fields and destroying villages. When it ended with Eldred driving his sword through Aldred's heart on the steps of the throne, both brothers were destroyed—one dead, one broken. The kingdom that emerged was a shadow of its former self, weakened precisely when it needed strength to face the growing threats from beyond its borders.

## What Happened

### Summary
Following the death of King Aldric IV, his eldest son Aldred took the throne and immediately began implementing radical reforms designed to centralize power and eliminate what he saw as corruption and inefficiency in the noble houses and religious institutions. The traditional nobility saw this as tyranny and formed a coalition to oppose him, rallying behind his younger brother Eldred as their rightful king. The resulting civil war lasted three years, devastating the kingdom's heartland and killing thousands. It ended when Eldred led a final assault on the capital, fought his way to the throne room, and killed his brother in single combat. The kingdom was reunified under Eldred II, but the costs—material, political, and psychological—have never been fully recovered.

### Timeline

1. **The Succession Crisis (1944 RS):** King Aldric IV dies. His heir Aldred takes the throne and announces the "New Order" reforms within days of his coronation.

2. **The Reforms:** Aldred dissolves the Council of Lords, announces plans to seize temple lands for redistribution, and begins replacing hereditary noble positions with appointed administrators.

3. **The Noble Conspiracy:** The great houses meet in secret at Highwall. They approach Prince Eldred, begging him to oppose his brother. Eldred initially refuses—he loves Aldred.

4. **The Temple Seizure:** Aldred's soldiers forcibly take control of several Silver Flame temples. Priests are imprisoned. This act unites the religious and noble opposition.

5. **Eldred's Decision:** After Aldred orders the execution of the elderly Duke of Westmarch for "conspiracy," Eldred can no longer stay neutral. He publicly denounces his brother.

6. **Declaration of War:** The Western Lords declare Eldred the true king. Aldred responds by stripping his brother of titles and declaring him a traitor. Civil war begins.

7. **The Burning Years (1944-1946 RS):** Two years of inconclusive warfare. Neither side can achieve decisive victory. The heartland is ravaged. Harvests fail. Disease spreads.

8. **The Covenant's Hand:** Unknown to most, the Covenant of the Unveiled Truth provides secret funding and advisors to Aldred, hoping to prolong the war and weaken the kingdom.

9. **The Turning Point (Late 1946 RS):** Eldred wins the Battle of the Three Fords, cutting Aldred's supply lines. The capital is besieged.

10. **The Throne Room (1947 RS):** Eldred leads a small force into the palace through secret passages. He confronts Aldred in the throne room. Their final conversation is unknown, but it ends with Eldred killing his brother.

### Location
**Where:** [[The Kingdom of Aerendor]], primarily the Westmark, the Valdris Vale, and [[Lond Daer]]

**Significance of Location:** The civil war was fought in the most fertile and populated regions of the kingdom—the agricultural heartland. The destruction of these areas caused famines that killed more people than the battles themselves.

### Key Moments
**Turning Point:** The Battle of the Three Fords, where Eldred's cavalry destroyed Aldred's baggage train and cut his army off from resupply. After this, Aldred's defeat was only a matter of time.

**Climax:** The final confrontation in the throne room. What passed between the brothers is unknown—no witnesses survived, and Eldred has never spoken of it. The only certainty is that Eldred emerged alone, covered in his brother's blood.

**Resolution:** Eldred's coronation as Eldred II, held not in celebration but in mourning. He wore black and wept throughout the ceremony.

## Causes

### Immediate Causes
- Aldred's radical reforms threatened the power and wealth of the traditional nobility
- The seizure of temple lands united religious authorities against the crown
- Eldred's popular reputation made him a natural alternative for the rebels to rally behind
- Aldred's execution of respected nobles removed any possibility of compromise

### Underlying Causes
- Corruption in the noble houses had created genuine problems Aldred sought to address
- The royal family had grown distant from one another, allowing mistrust to fester
- The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth saw an opportunity to weaken the kingdom
- Generational tensions between traditionalists and reformers had been building for decades

### Catalyst
The execution of the Duke of Westmarch—an elderly, beloved noble whose only crime was attending a meeting to discuss "concerns" about the reforms. Eldred knew then that his brother had become something he could no longer defend.

## Consequences

### Immediate Effects
- Aldred dead; Eldred crowned as Eldred II
- The "New Order" reforms reversed; traditional nobility restored
- The kingdom's treasury emptied by three years of war
- The army depleted; veterans traumatized
- Thousands of refugees flooding into neighboring lands

### Long-term Effects

- The kingdom cannot mount effective defense against external threats
- Noble houses weakened; unable to fulfill traditional military obligations
- Mercenaries from the war became bandits in the eastern regions
- The Covenant's infiltration deepened during the chaos
- [[High King Thrain IV]]'s hatred of Aerendor was cemented when they couldn't send aid after the war

### Casualties/Losses

**Other Losses:** Noble lineages extinguished; cultural artifacts destroyed; public trust in monarchy damaged

### Winners
- Eldred II (technically; he won but at terrible cost)

- The Covenant (kingdom weakened as planned)
- Neighboring powers (Aerendor's weakness is their opportunity)

### Losers
- Aldred (dead)
- The common people (suffered most, gained nothing)
- The kingdom's future (weakened when threats are rising)
- Eldred personally (destroyed by what victory required)

## Legacy

### Historical Significance
The False King's War represents the greatest internal catastrophe in Aerendor's history since its founding. It demonstrated that even the most powerful kingdom of the Age of Shadows could tear itself apart, and that civil conflict could be as devastating as any external invasion. The war's shadow still lies over Aerendor's politics: nobles are watched for disloyalty, the king trusts no counsel, and the wounds between former allies have never fully healed.

### How It's Remembered
**Official Narrative:** The temples teach that Aldred was corrupted—possibly by the Shackled God's whispers, possibly by pride—and that Eldred's victory was righteous but tragic. The war is presented as a cautionary tale about the dangers of radical change.

**Popular Memory:** Common folk remember the war as a time of horror—armies marching through farms, soldiers demanding food and livestock, disease and famine in the camps. Many families lost someone. "No more war of brothers" is a common toast.

**Controversial Aspects:** Supporters of Aldred's reforms still exist, arguing that his methods were harsh but his goals were correct. Some whisper that Eldred was no better than Aldred—that he killed his brother for the throne, not for the kingdom.

### Commemorations
**Holidays:** The Day of Reconciliation marks the war's end, intended as a day to heal divisions. Few celebrate it; most treat it as a day of mourning.

**Monuments:** The Brothers' Stone in Lond Daer marks the spot where Eldred allegedly wept after killing Aldred. It is said to be permanently wet with the king's tears.

**Traditions:** The king wears the wedding ring of his dead wife on his left hand and a ring of black iron on his right—symbolizing his marriage to the throne and the death of his brother.

### Lessons
- Civil war destroys what it claims to save
- Radical reform without consensus breeds rebellion
- Even righteous causes can require unforgivable acts
- The Covenant can influence events without being seen

## Contemporary Accounts

### Primary Sources

| Source | Author | Perspective |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| *The Righteous Rebellion* | Lord General Kaelen | Military commander's tactical memoir |
| *Lament for Two Kings* | Anonymous | Sympathetic to both brothers; widely read |
| *The Necessary War* | High Priest Aldous | Religious justification for Eldred's cause |
| *Aldred's Vision* | Unknown (possibly Covenant) | Argues Aldred was correct; suppressed |

### Eyewitness Accounts
- A soldier who fought for Eldred described the throne room after: "The king sat on the steps, covered in blood, not moving. We had to carry him to his coronation."
- A farmer's letter describes soldiers from both sides taking her grain: "Neither side cared if we starved. They only cared that the other side didn't get our food."
- A priest recorded Eldred's confession (details sealed): "I heard a man unburdening a weight that would have crushed lesser souls."

### Official Records
The Royal Archives contain extensive documentation of the war, but sections relating to the throne room confrontation and the Covenant's involvement have been sealed by royal decree.

## Historical Debate

### Accepted Version
Aldred, corrupted by power or darker influences, became a tyrant. Eldred reluctantly led the loyalist resistance. After three years of necessary war, Eldred defeated his brother and restored righteous rule. The war was tragic but inevitable.

### Alternative Interpretations
- **The Reformer's Defense:** Aldred was actually correct about the noble corruption; his methods were harsh but necessary, and Eldred's victory preserved a broken system
- **The Covenant Theory:** The Covenant manipulated both brothers, ensuring the war would weaken whoever won
- **The Pragmatist View:** Neither brother was right or wrong; it was a power struggle dressed up in ideological clothing
- **The Paranoid Version:** Eldred wanted the throne all along and used the rebellion as an excuse

### Controversies
- What really happened in the throne room? What were Aldred's last words?
- Was Aldred truly corrupt, or was he ahead of his time?
- Did Eldred have other options besides killing his brother?
- How deeply was the Covenant involved, and does their influence continue?

### Unknown Elements
- The final conversation between the brothers
- The extent of Covenant involvement
- Whether Aldred had any legitimate heirs (rumors persist)
- The location of Aldred's grave (officially unmarked)

## Connections to Present

### Ongoing Effects
- King Eldred II's paranoia dominates Aerendor's governance
- The kingdom cannot project military power effectively
- Noble houses are too weak to fulfill traditional obligations
- The eastern provinces are plagued by bandits (former mercenaries)
- Distrust between traditional allies remains

### Related Current Events
- The Covenant continues to exploit the kingdom's weakness
- [[Princess Elara]] struggles to govern around her father's paranoia
- [[High King Thrain IV]] blames Aerendor for not aiding him after the war
- Lord General Kaelen grows old; his replacement may not share his loyalty

### Lingering Tensions
- Survivors of pro-Aldred families have not forgotten
- Some eastern lords quietly resent the Western Lords' dominance
- The question of succession (Princess Elara vs. any hidden heirs of Aldred) remains unresolved

## Secrets

1. The [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] funded Aldred's mercenaries and provided him with advisors who encouraged his most extreme actions. They wanted the war to continue as long as possible to weaken the kingdom.

2. Aldred's dying words were: "The shadows whispered to me, brother. They'll whisper to you too." This suggests the Shackled God's corruption played a role in the False King's madness.

3. King Eldred II knows about the Covenant's involvement but has never acted on the knowledge—partially because he fears their reach, partially because exposing them would require admitting how thoroughly they infiltrated his brother's court.

4. Aldred may have had a secret heir—a child by a commoner lover, hidden away before the war. If this child exists and can be proven, they would have a claim to the throne.

5. The reason King Aldric IV's death was so sudden and convenient (leaving Aldred to implement reforms before anyone could react) is that he was poisoned—possibly by Covenant agents, possibly by Aldred himself.

## Plot Hooks

1. **Aldred's Heir:** A young person claiming to be Aldred's secret child has emerged, backed by eastern lords who remember the reforms favorably. True heir or Covenant puppet?

2. **The Sealed Confession:** High Priest Aldous is dying. His records include Eldred's sealed confession from after the war. Multiple factions want to know what the king said.

3. **The Brothers' Reconciliation:** A medium claims she can contact Aldred's spirit. King Eldred desperately wants closure—but is this genuine, a scam, or a Covenant trap?

4. **Mercenary Justice:** One of Aldred's former mercenary captains—now a bandit king in the east—possesses documents proving the Covenant's involvement in the war. He'll trade them for a pardon.

5. **The King's Nightmare:** King Eldred's paranoia has worsened; he sees Aldred's ghost everywhere. Is he going mad, or is something genuinely haunting him?
