# The Plague of Silence

> [!info] Character Summary
> A devastating magical plague that targeted those with arcane ability—the mage-born who could hear the Echoes of Creation. Emerging from the [[The Mirelands|Mirelands]] as a purple mist, the Plague first stole its victims' voices, then their minds, and finally their lives. Over two terrible years, nearly a third of all magic-users perished. The terror sparked the Mage Purges, and its legacy is the deep suspicion of arcane magic that persists to this day. What few realize is that the Plague was no natural occurrence—it was the Covenant's first great strike against a world they believe must be "freed" from divine harmony.

## Overview

The Plague of Silence remains the most deadly magical catastrophe since [[The Betrayal]] itself. In the year 800 RS, a purple-tinged mist began drifting from the festering swamps of the Mirelands, carried by unnatural winds that seemed to seek populated areas. At first, people thought it merely an unusual fog. Then the mages began dying. The Plague targeted only those who could hear the Echoes—the magical resonance left over from [[The Song of Creation]]. First came the loss of voice: victims could not speak, could not cast verbal spells, could not cry out for help. Then came the loss of mind: memories unraveled, personalities dissolved, victims became hollow shells that walked and breathed but no longer lived. Finally, death—peaceful in appearance but terrifying in its selectivity. Over two years, the Plague swept across all civilized lands, claiming an estimated 30% of all mage-born. Worse than the deaths was the terror it spawned: common folk, not understanding the Plague's selectivity, turned on anyone who might be a mage. The Purges claimed nearly as many lives as the Plague itself.

## Classification

### Type
**Event Type:** Magical Plague / Biological / Conspiracy

### Timing
**Date:** 800-802 RS (The Plague Years)

**Era/Age:** [[Age of Shadows]] (Middle Period)

**Duration:** 2 years of active plague; decades of aftermath

### Scale
**Scope:** Global (all civilized lands with magic-using populations)

**Significance Level:** Major (reshaped society's relationship with magic)

## What Happened

### Summary
An unnatural plague emerged from the Mirelands and spread across the world, targeting exclusively those with magical ability. The disease progressed in three stages—loss of voice, loss of mind, and death—and proved resistant to both magical and mundane treatment. Only the Arcane Synod, a mysterious organization of mages, possessed a cure, which they dispensed selectively in exchange for loyalty and control. By the time the Plague ran its course, the magical community was decimated, the Synod had risen to power over surviving mages, and common folk had developed a lasting terror of arcane practitioners.

### Timeline

1. **First Sightings (Early 800 RS):** Purple mist observed rising from deep in the Mirelands. Local villages report unusual fog that seems to follow travelers.

2. **First Deaths (Spring 800 RS):** Hedge witches and village healers in Mireland border communities stop speaking. Within weeks, they stop thinking. Within a month, they stop breathing.

3. **Spread (Summer 800 RS):** The Plague spreads beyond the Mirelands, carried by winds that seem intentionally directed. Major cities report cases. The Academy of Rivergard loses a quarter of its students in a single week.

4. **Recognition (Autumn 800 RS):** Scholars identify the pattern—only those with magical ability are affected. The term "Plague of Silence" enters common use.

5. **The Purges Begin (Winter 800 RS):** Terrified commoners, unable to tell who is a mage, begin attacking anyone suspected of magical ability. Mages are burned, drowned, and hanged in communities across the world.

6. **The Synod's Cure (Spring 801 RS):** The Arcane Synod reveals they possess a treatment that can halt the Plague in its early stages. They offer it to mages who swear loyalty to the Synod.

7. **Peak Deaths (Summer 801 RS):** The Plague reaches maximum lethality. Entire magical bloodlines are extinguished. The great wizard towers stand empty.

8. **The Waning (Winter 801 RS):** New cases begin to decline. The purple mist dissipates. The Plague seems to be running its course.

9. **Aftermath Begins (802 RS):** The Plague ends, but the Purges continue. The Synod emerges as the dominant force in arcane affairs, controlling access to what remains of magical knowledge.

10. **Long Silence (803-900 RS):** For a century, magic is rare and feared. The Synod maintains iron control. The arcane traditions that survived are fragments of what existed before.

### Location
**Where:** Originated in [[The Mirelands]]; spread globally

**Significance of Location:** The Mirelands are a festering swamp where the barriers between planes are thin—a place of corruption and dark magic. That the Plague emerged there suggests supernatural origin. The Covenant later used this association to claim the Plague was "natural," a sign that magic itself was diseased.

### Key Moments
**Turning Point:** The Synod's revelation of a cure. This single moment determined who would control magic in the aftermath—not the kingdoms, not the temples, but a secretive organization with unclear loyalties.

**Climax:** The summer of 801 RS, when deaths peaked and entire cities watched their magical communities die in silence, unable to speak even to say goodbye.

**Resolution:** There was no dramatic end. The Plague simply... stopped. The purple mist dissipated. New cases ceased. The world was left to count its dead and decide what to do with the survivors.

## Causes

### Immediate Causes
- The purple mist emerged from the Mirelands and spread on unnatural winds
- The mist carried a contagion that specifically targeted those with magical sensitivity
- Magical and mundane treatments proved ineffective (by design)
- Panic led to the Purges, which compounded the death toll

### Underlying Causes
- The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth had spent centuries developing the plague as a weapon
- The mage-born population had grown complacent, concentrating in vulnerable academies and towers
- Common folk's existing distrust of magic made them susceptible to fear-driven violence
- The gods' withdrawal left no divine intervention to stop the plague

### Catalyst
The Covenant deliberately released the Plague as a test of their ability to disrupt divine magic's Echo in mortal bloodlines. They did not expect it to be quite so deadly—or so effective.

## Participants

### Key Figures

| Name | Role | Fate |
|------|------|------|
| Archmagister Vaelorn | Leader of Rivergard Academy; early victim | Died, voiceless, trying to find a cure |
| The Synod Masters (unknown names) | Provided the cure; rose to power | Still control the Synod |
| High King Aldric II | King of Aerendor during the Plague | Ordered the Purges; later regretted it |
| Elder Willowmere | Elven healer who identified the pattern | Retreated to Whisperwood; possibly still alive |
| The First Vector (unknown) | Whoever carried the Plague from the Mirelands | Unknown; possibly a Covenant agent |

### Factions/Groups

| Group | Side/Role | Contribution |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| The Arcane Synod | Saviors / Controllers | Had the cure; used crisis to gain power |
| The Covenant (secretly) | Perpetrators | Created and released the Plague |
| [[The Kingdom of Aerendor]] | Victim / Purger | Lost many mages; conducted brutal Purges |
| The Academies | Victims | Lost students and knowledge |
| Common Folk | Fear-driven persecutors | Conducted the Purges against suspected mages |

### Victims
- Approximately 30% of all mage-born worldwide (tens of thousands)
- Magical academies devastated; entire schools emptied
- Ancient magical bloodlines extinguished
- Thousands of non-mages killed in Purges (mistakenly identified or hiding mage relatives)
- The profession of hedge magic (village healers, wise women) nearly eliminated

### Heroes
- Healers who worked tirelessly despite the danger
- Mages who hid their condition to continue helping communities
- Elder Willowmere, who identified the pattern and may have developed treatments beyond the Synod's
- Priests who sheltered suspected mages from Purge mobs

### Villains
- The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth (secretly responsible)
- The Arcane Synod (exploited the crisis for power)
- Those who led the Purges, killing innocent people out of fear
- High King Aldric II, who legitimized the violence

## Consequences

### Immediate Effects
- Mass death among the magical community
- The Purges killed thousands more (mages and suspected mages alike)
- Magical knowledge was lost as practitioners died without passing on their secrets
- The Arcane Synod rose to control over all remaining mages

### Long-term Effects
- Magic became feared and restricted in most societies
- The Synod's control over magical education persists (corrupted from within by Covenant infiltrators)
- Village hedge magic nearly extinct; communities lost local healers
- Magical bloodlines weaker; fewer mage-born in subsequent generations
- Lasting prejudice against arcane practitioners

### Casualties/Losses
**Deaths:** 30% of mage-born (estimated 40,000-60,000); additional thousands in Purges

**Injuries:** Survivors often bore psychological scars; some had permanent magical damage

**Property:** Academies abandoned, towers left empty, magical libraries destroyed by Purge mobs

**Other Losses:** Countless spells, traditions, and magical techniques died with their practitioners

### Winners
- The Arcane Synod (gained control over magic)
- The Covenant (tested their weapon; weakened magical opposition)
- Those who feared magic (saw their prejudices apparently validated)

### Losers
- The mage-born (decimated)
- Magical traditions (nearly destroyed)
- Communities that relied on magical healing and protection
- Everyone, ultimately (the world became darker without magic's light)

## Legacy

### Historical Significance
The Plague of Silence fundamentally changed society's relationship with magic. Before the Plague, mages were valued members of communities—healers, advisors, protectors. After the Plague, they were feared at best, hunted at worst. This legacy persists nearly 1,200 years later, making the practice of arcane magic dangerous and the training of new mages a delicate political matter.

### How It's Remembered
**Official Narrative:** The temples teach that the Plague was a warning from the gods—that mortals had grown too reliant on arcane power and needed to remember that divine magic, channeled through proper faith, was safer and more righteous.

**Popular Memory:** Common folk remember the Plague as proof that magic is dangerous and unnatural. "Mage-touched" remains an insult. Parents still use "the Purple Doom will get you" to frighten children into obedience.

**Controversial Aspects:** Some scholars question the Synod's convenient possession of the cure. A minority view holds that the Plague was artificial—created deliberately to control or eliminate mages. The Covenant encourages this suspicion, blaming the gods or the Synod rather than themselves.

### Commemorations
**Holidays:** The Day of Silent Voices (midsummer) is observed in some regions as a day of mourning for the lost mages.

**Monuments:** The Empty Chairs at Rivergard Academy—one hundred chairs representing the students who died—are maintained but never occupied.

**Traditions:** Mages who complete their training receive a silver bell to wear, symbolizing that their voice has survived what silence could not take.

### Lessons
- Concentration makes you vulnerable (mages in isolated towers died in clusters)
- Fear is a weapon as deadly as any plague
- Those who offer salvation in crisis may have planned the crisis
- Magic, once lost, is nearly impossible to recover

## Contemporary Accounts

### Primary Sources

| Source | Author | Perspective |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| *The Silent Chronicle* | Anonymous Synod Archivist | The Synod's official account; sanitized |
| *Voices Stolen* | Elder Willowmere | The elven healer's analysis; suppressed |
| *The Necessary Purge* | High King Aldric II | Justification for the Purges; later recanted |
| *The Purple Truth* | Anonymous (Covenant) | Claims the Plague was divine punishment; propaganda |

### Eyewitness Accounts
- A healer described watching her mentor "forget how to be herself, one memory at a time"
- A survivor wrote of "screaming without sound, knowing death was coming and unable to tell anyone I loved them"
- A Purge survivor described hiding in a cellar while mobs burned suspected mages alive above

### Official Records
The Synod maintains the *Registry of the Silenced*—a list of every mage known to have died. The Registry is incomplete; many deaths went unrecorded in the chaos.

## Historical Debate

### Accepted Version
A natural magical plague emerged from the Mirelands, targeting those with arcane ability. The Synod heroically provided a cure and has since worked to protect the magical community from similar threats. The Purges were a regrettable overreaction to legitimate fear.

### Alternative Interpretations
- **The Conspiracy Theory:** The Plague was created deliberately—either by the Synod to seize power or by the gods to punish mages
- **The Covenant's Cover Story:** The Plague was a natural consequence of magic's corruption of the Song of Creation
- **The Elven Account:** The Plague was a Covenant weapon; Elder Willowmere's suppressed work proves this
- **The Dwarven View:** The Plague was sent by the Shackled God to weaken his enemies

### Controversies
- How did the Synod have a cure ready so quickly?
- Why did the Plague stop? Did the Synod end it, or did it run its course?
- Were the Purges coordinated or spontaneous?
- What happened to Elder Willowmere's research?

### Unknown Elements
- The Plague's exact origin (the Covenant knows, but no one else)
- Whether any natural immunity exists
- The full death toll (records are incomplete)
- Whether the Plague could return

## Connections to Present

### Ongoing Effects
- Magic remains feared; mages face prejudice
- The Synod controls magical education and licensing
- Magical bloodlines are weaker than before the Plague
- Communities lack the hedge magic tradition that once provided basic healing

### Related Current Events
- The Covenant has perfected the Plague's formula and may deploy it again
- The Synod is infiltrated by Covenant agents at the highest levels
- Recent rumors of "purple mist" sightings near the Mirelands have caused panic

### Lingering Tensions
- Mages resent the restrictions placed on them since the Plague
- Common folk still fear magic and those who wield it
- The elves refuse to share their magical knowledge, citing the Plague as proof humans cannot be trusted with it

## Secrets

1. The [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] created the Plague as a test of their ability to disrupt the Song's Echoes in mortal bloodlines. They did not expect such lethality and considered the results a success beyond their dreams.

2. The Arcane Synod did not discover the cure—they were given it by a Covenant infiltrator who needed the Synod to survive (and be controlled) as part of the Covenant's long-term plans.

3. Elder Willowmere discovered the truth about the Plague's origin. Her research was suppressed, and she was forced to flee to the Whisperwood. She may still be alive, with evidence that could expose the Covenant.

4. The Plague did not end naturally. The Covenant recalled it when they had achieved their goals. They can release it again whenever they choose.

5. High King Aldric IV (two generations after Aldric II) was prevented from sending troops to the Great Siege of the Iron Holds because Covenant agents threatened to release the Plague in Aerendor's major cities. This is why [[High King Thrain IV]] received no aid.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Purple Returns:** Purple mist has been sighted near a border village. Is it the Plague returning, a hoax, or something else entirely? The party must investigate before panic spreads.

2. **Willowmere's Legacy:** An old map points to Elder Willowmere's hidden research. Multiple factions want it—the Synod to suppress it, the Covenant to destroy it, and others to expose the truth.

3. **The Last Bloodline:** A character discovers they are descended from a family thought extinct after the Plague. They may carry natural immunity—or be a target for those who want to study it.

4. **Synod Secrets:** Evidence suggests the Synod knew about the Plague before it struck. But exposing them means facing the organization that controls all legal magic.

5. **The Cure's Price:** A character's magical relative has contracted a new illness with familiar symptoms. The Synod offers a cure—but the price is joining their organization permanently.

### The Event
**Prompt:**
> A tragic scene during the Plague of Silence. A mage academy's great hall, once filled with the sound of learning, now silent as death. Purple mist hangs in the air. Young mages lie on beds and makeshift cots, their mouths open but voiceless, eyes vacant. Healers in cloth masks move between them, expressions of despair visible even through the fabric. On the walls, magical diagrams and spell formulas glow faintly, their makers gone. Through tall windows, the silhouettes of a mob with torches approaches. The atmosphere is one of horror, helplessness, and approaching doom.

### Memorial/Aftermath
**Prompt:**
> The Empty Chairs memorial at Rivergard Academy. A solemn courtyard ringed by ancient buildings. In the center, one hundred ornate wooden chairs arranged in concentric circles, each bearing a carved name. The chairs are empty but immaculately maintained, draped in purple cloth. Around the memorial, living mages stand in silence, heads bowed. Some wear silver bells that catch the light. The sky is overcast, appropriate to the mood. Flowers have been laid at the base of several chairs. The atmosphere is one of remembered loss and quiet determination.
