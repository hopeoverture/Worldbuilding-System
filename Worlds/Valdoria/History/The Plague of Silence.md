# The Plague of Silence

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A terrifying magical epidemic that targeted those with arcane potential. It caused victims to lose their voice, then their mind, then their life.

## Overview
Eighty years ago, a mysterious purple mist drifted from [[The Mirelands]]. It infected only those who could hear the Echoes of Creation (mages). The victims were rendered mute, unable to cast spoken spells, before wasting away.

## Consequences
- **The Purge:** Commoners, fearing contagion, hunted down mages.
- **The Synod's Rise:** Only the Arcane Synod had the cure, cementing their control over all magic users.
