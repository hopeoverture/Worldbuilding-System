# The Siege of Highwall

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A desperate defense mission. An Orc horde from the Ashlands, led by a Cult sorcerer, smashes against the fortress town. The party must command defenses, root out saboteurs, and hold the line.

## Overview
The "Monster Raids" were a distraction. The true army of the [[The Ashlands]] has arrived, bearing siege engines of black iron. [[Commander Kaelen]] is injured in the first assault.
