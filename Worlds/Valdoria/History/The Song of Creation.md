# The Song of Creation

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The "Tolkien-esque" creation myth. The world was sung into existence by the gods.

## Overview
In the beginning, there was only silence. Then, the Prime Mover sang a single note, and the Pantheon joined in harmony. From this music, the stars, the land, and the seas were formed. The beauty of the world is an echo of that original song.

## Significance
Magic in Valdoria is often seen as "manipulating the Echoes" of creation. Bards and Spellsingers tap into this primal power uniquely.
