# The Kingdom of Aerendor

> [!info] Character Summary
> The oldest surviving human kingdom in western Valdoria, Aerendor carries the weight of history—a noble but fading realm that remembers the glories of the past while struggling with the realities of the present. Once the heart of a continental empire, its borders have retreated to the coastal lands of [[The Westmark]]. Under [[King Eldred II]]'s paranoid and defensive rule, the kingdom maintains its traditions while slowly crumbling at the edges, a sunset realm whose best days may be behind it.

## Overview

The Kingdom of Aerendor stands as the last great bastion of human civilization in western Valdoria, a realm of white stone cities and ancient noble houses that traces its heritage back to the survivors of [[The Age of Shadows]]. For nearly eighteen centuries, the Golden Eagle has flown above [[Lond Daer]], symbol of a kingdom that once controlled territories stretching to the mountains. Now those borders have shrunk, the great cities are too large for their populations, and the royal treasury drains faster than it fills. [[King Eldred II]] rules from the White Palace, a man broken by kinslaying and consumed by paranoia, seeing Covenant agents in every shadow while the kingdom's real problems—economic stagnation, depopulation, and rising threats from the wilderness—go unaddressed. Yet for all its decline, Aerendor remains powerful. Its legions are professional, its walls are strong, and its people remember what they once were. A sunset kingdom, perhaps, but the sun has not yet fully set.

## Classification

### Government Type
**Type:** Hereditary Monarchy

**Subtype:** Feudal kingdom with strong noble houses. The King rules in theory by divine right, but in practice his power depends on maintaining support from the great lords who control military levies and tax collection.

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Ancient Bloodline and Divine Right—the royal house claims descent from Aerendor the Great, founder of the kingdom, blessed by the gods to rule. The Eagle Crown recognizes the legitimate heir.

**Public Perception:** Mixed. The common folk love the institution of the monarchy as a symbol of stability and protection. The current king is viewed with sympathy (for his tragedies) and concern (for his mental state). The nobility range from fiercely loyal to quietly discontented. Merchants and scholars increasingly view the crown as an obstacle to progress.

## Territory

### Extent
**Core Territories:**
- The coastal plains and river valleys of [[The Westmark]]
- The Royal Demesne surrounding [[Lond Daer]]
- The Coastlands stretching north and south of the capital
- The High Hills along the eastern border

**Lost Territories (Claimed but Not Held):**
- Former eastern provinces in [[The Greenfields]] (abandoned generations ago)
- Northern coastal settlements (depopulated)
- Mountain pass fortresses (ruined)

**Vassal/Dependent Territories:**
- [[Highwall]] (garrison town on the border)
- Minor border settlements in the foothills

### Borders
**Natural Boundaries:**
- West: The Great Ocean (impassable)
- North: The cold moors leading to [[The Pale North]] (natural barrier)
- East: The Valdris River and the open plains of [[The Greenfields]]
- South: The hills and forests leading to [[The Valdris Vale]]

**Fortified Borders:**
- The Eastern Line: A series of watchtowers and fortifications along the Valdris River
- [[Highwall]]: The major garrison defending the pass to [[The Sundered Peaks]]
- The Northern Marches: Deteriorating fortresses, many undermanned

**Border Disputes:**
- Eastern border settlements drift between royal law and independence
- Tensions with [[The River Compact]] over trade rights
- Ancient grudge with [[The Iron Holds]] over failed alliance during the Great Siege

**Relations with Neighbors:**
- [[The Iron Holds]]: Bitter distrust; High King Thrain refuses direct dealings
- [[The River Compact]]: Cool but necessary trade relations; political rivalry
- [[The Grey Wardens]]: Cautious acceptance; they operate within the kingdom with permission
- [[The Order of the Silver Flame]]: Formal alliance; the Order has legal authority here

### Capital
**Name:** [[Lond Daer]] (The Grey Harbor)

**Description:** A massive ancient port city built of white stone that has weathered to pale gray over centuries. The city was designed for a million souls but houses only 250,000. Entire districts stand empty, their grand buildings maintained by a skeleton staff or left to crumble. The White Palace rises at the city's heart, its spires visible for miles, while the great harbor still hosts the largest naval fleet in western Valdoria. The city is beautiful, melancholic, and haunted by the ghosts of its greater past.

**Why Located Here:** An excellent natural deep-water harbor protected by defensible cliffs, fresh water from the Bright River, and fertile farmland in the surrounding valleys.

### Major Regions

1. **The Royal Demesne:** The fertile lands directly surrounding [[Lond Daer]], ruled directly by the Crown. Population: ~150,000. The kingdom's breadbasket and political center.

2. **The Coastlands:** The economic heart of the kingdom, focused on fishing, shipping, and coastal trade. Stretches north and south of the capital. Population: ~300,000. Controlled by the Duke of Tidewater and the Count of Southshore.

3. **The High Hills:** Mining country and sheep-herding land along the eastern border. The military frontier where the Royal Legions maintain their strongest presence. Population: ~200,000. Controlled by the Duke of Highwall.

4. **The Northern Marches:** Cold, sparsely populated borderland leading to the wilderness. Population: ~100,000. Nominally controlled by the Margrave of the North, but effectively independent.

5. **The Heartlands:** Central agricultural region between the capital and the eastern border. Population: ~100,000. Divided among several baronies.

## Structure of Power

### Head of State
**Title:** High King of Aerendor, Lord of the Westmark, Defender of the Realm

**Current Holder:** [[King Eldred II]], called "The Weary King" or "The Last Eagle"

**Selection Method:** Hereditary primogeniture (eldest child inherits, male preference)

**Term:** Life

**Powers:**
- Supreme judicial authority
- Commander-in-chief of all military forces
- Power to grant and revoke noble titles
- Authority over foreign policy and treaties
- Right to levy emergency taxes (with Council approval for regular taxation)
- Appointing power for major offices

### Ruling Body
**Name:** The Council of Lords

**Composition:**
- The seven Great Lords (hereditary seats)
- The Lord Chancellor (appointed)
- The Lord Commander (appointed)
- The High Justiciar (appointed)
- The High Priest (religious representative)

**Powers:**
- Advises the King on all matters
- Must approve major taxes and declarations of war
- Can refuse to provide levies (effectively a veto on military action)
- Serves as regency council if the King is incapacitated
- Elects a regent from among themselves if no adult heir exists

**How Members Selected:** Great Lords hold hereditary seats. Other positions are royal appointments, though tradition limits choices to candidates acceptable to the nobility.

### Key Offices

| Office | Holder | Responsibilities |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Lord Chancellor | Lord Hador of Brightwall | Day-to-day administration, treasury, correspondence |
| Lord Commander | [[Lord General Kaelen]] | Commander of the Royal Legions, military strategy |
| High Justiciar | Lady Morwen | Supreme judge, interpreter of ancient law, oversees courts |
| Royal Spymaster | (Position officially vacant) | Intelligence, counter-espionage—Eldred trusts no one with this |
| High Priest | Aldous (of the Silver Flame) | Spiritual advisor, liaison with the Order |
| Lord Admiral | Duke Tidewater | Commander of the Royal Navy |
| Warden of the Marches | Margrave Theodric | Defense of the northern border |

### Succession
**Line of Succession:**
1. [[Princess Elara]] (daughter, only surviving child)
2. Lord Hador of Brightwall (distant cousin, would likely serve as regent)
3. Disputed among Great Lords (would trigger succession crisis)

**Selection Process:** The eldest legitimate heir inherits automatically. The Eagle Crown is said to reject usurpers—it will not sit comfortably on an unworthy head.

**Recent Successions:** Eldred II took the throne 40 years ago after killing his brother Aldred in [[The False King's War]]. This was necessary but traumatic; the kinslaying haunts Eldred to this day.

**Potential Crises:** [[Princess Elara]] is unmarried and the sole heir. Several lords quietly position themselves as potential regents or successors. If she dies without children, the succession is unclear.

## Administration

### Bureaucracy
**Size and Efficiency:** Large but inefficient. The royal bureaucracy has accumulated centuries of precedent, protocol, and redundant offices. Every decision requires multiple approvals; every document must follow ancient forms.

**Key Departments:**
- The Chancery (correspondence, records, internal communications)
- The Exchequer (taxation, treasury, finances)
- The Justicariat (courts, law enforcement, legal interpretation)
- The Marshalsea (military logistics, recruitment, supplies)
- The Harbor Authority (naval affairs, port operations, customs)

**Corruption Level:** Moderate. Noble privileges often override law. Bribery is common at lower levels, though the upper administration remains relatively honest. The real problem is inefficiency rather than corruption.

**Record Keeping:** Extensive. Records survive from the kingdom's founding. The Royal Archives contain documentation of nearly every major transaction, judgment, and event for eighteen centuries—but finding anything specific requires weeks of searching.

### Taxation
**Types of Taxes:**
- Land Tax: Assessed on all agricultural land, collected by local lords who pass a portion to the Crown
- Harbor Tariffs: Duties on all goods entering or leaving Aerendor's ports
- "Protection Tithe": A special levy for military expenses, deeply resented
- Noble Dues: Payments from lords for the privilege of their titles
- Royal Monopolies: Salt, precious metals, certain luxury goods

**Collection Methods:** Local lords collect most taxes and remit a percentage to the Crown. The Exchequer sends inspectors, but noble influence limits their effectiveness.

**Tax Burden:** High and rising. Maintaining the ancient fortifications, paying the legions, and supporting the bloated bureaucracy requires ever-increasing revenue from a shrinking population.

**Major Revenue Sources:**
- Harbor tariffs (~40%)
- Land tax (~30%)
- Protection tithe (~15%)
- Noble dues and monopolies (~15%)

### Law & Justice
**Law Codes:** The Laws of Aerendor, codified during the Golden Age and amended minimally since. A complex body of precedent-based law that requires trained jurists to interpret.

**Courts:**
- Royal Court: The King or High Justiciar for cases involving nobility or kingdom-wide matters
- Baronial Courts: Local lords for most civil and minor criminal matters
- Temple Courts: Religious matters, handled by the Order of the Silver Flame

**Punishments:**
- Minor crimes: Fines, public humiliation, short imprisonment
- Major crimes: Imprisonment, exile, execution (for murder, treason)
- Noble crimes: Stripping of titles, exile (execution rare for nobility)

**Rights:**
- All subjects have right to trial before punishment
- All subjects can appeal to the King (in theory)
- Nobles have extensive privileges (trial by peers, exemption from torture)
- Foreigners have limited legal standing

### Military
**Standing Army:** ~12,000 professional soldiers in the Royal Legions, supplemented by:
- ~3,000 Royal Guards (elite, garrison the capital)
- ~2,000 Border Watch (patrol the eastern frontier)
- ~1,500 Naval Marines

**Wartime Forces:** Noble levies can potentially raise an additional 30,000-40,000 troops, but mobilization is slow and loyalty is to individual lords rather than the Crown.

**Command Structure:** Lord Commander Kaelen holds overall command, but noble levies answer to their own lords who then (theoretically) follow royal orders.

**Quality:** The Royal Legions are well-trained and well-equipped. Noble levies vary wildly from excellent household troops to barely armed peasants.

**Weakness:** The army is garrison-focused—excellent at defending walls but inexperienced in offensive warfare. The King's paranoia has kept most forces in the capital rather than the borders.

## Politics

### Factions

1. **The Restorationists (Hawks)**
   - **Goals:** Reclaim lost territories, project strength, restore Aerendor's glory
   - **Methods:** Military buildup, aggressive diplomacy, pressure on the King
   - **Leader:** Duke Aldric of Highwall
   - **Influence:** Strong among military officers and frontier lords

2. **The Isolationists (Doves) — Dominant**
   - **Goals:** Fortify the Westmark, avoid foreign entanglements, preserve stability
   - **Methods:** Defensive spending, diplomatic neutrality, maintaining the status quo
   - **Leader:** Lord Chancellor Hador (with tacit royal support)
   - **Influence:** Dominant in court; the King's paranoia aligns with their caution

3. **The Mercantile Interest**
   - **Goals:** Increase trade, reduce noble privileges, modernize the economy
   - **Methods:** Economic arguments, leveraging their growing wealth for influence
   - **Leader:** Guildmaster Aldric Silverhand of Lond Daer
   - **Influence:** Growing in the capital; resisted by traditionalists

4. **The Elarist Reformers**
   - **Goals:** Support [[Princess Elara]]'s quiet efforts to modernize the kingdom
   - **Methods:** Working within the system, preparing for the next reign
   - **Leader:** Princess Elara (unofficially)
   - **Influence:** Small but growing among younger nobles and administrators

### Current Issues

1. **The King's Paranoia:** Eldred sees Covenant agents everywhere. His obsessive focus on internal security leaves external threats unaddressed and alienates loyal subjects.

2. **The Succession:** Princess Elara is 35 and unmarried. Pressure mounts for her to wed and produce heirs. She resists matches she considers unsuitable.

3. **Economic Decline:** Trade routes to the east are dangerous; the dwarves are difficult partners; population is falling. The treasury bleeds gold faster than it fills.

4. **The Eastern Threat:** Reports of darkness rising in the wilderness—cult activity, monster incursions, unnatural phenomena. The King believes it's Covenant work but lacks resources to address it.

5. **Noble Restlessness:** Some lords grow frustrated with Eldred's defensive crouch. Whispers of removing the King (for his own good, of course) circulate in dark corners.

### Foreign Policy
**General Approach:** Isolationist by necessity and the King's preference. Aerendor maintains polite but distant relations with neighbors.

**Alliances:**
- [[The Order of the Silver Flame]]: Formal alliance; the Order has legal authority within the kingdom
- No other formal alliances

**Rivalries:**
- [[The Iron Holds]]: Bitter historical grudge over the Great Siege (1887 RS)
- [[The River Compact]]: Economic competition, political tension

**Trade Relationships:**
- [[The River Compact]]: Primary trading partner despite tensions
- [[The Iron Holds]]: Minimal trade through [[Highwall]], conducted through intermediaries
- Overseas: Some trade with distant lands through [[Lond Daer]]'s harbor

**Diplomatic Style:** Formal, precedent-bound, and cautious. Aerendor's diplomats are skilled at saying nothing while appearing gracious. The King personally trusts no foreign power.

## Society

### Governed Population
**Population Size:** ~850,000 (down from ~1.2 million a century ago)

**Major Demographics:**
- Humans: 90%
- Halflings: 5% (concentrated in the Coastlands)
- Dwarves: 3% (merchants and craftsmen in cities)
- Elves/Half-Elves: 2% (scattered throughout)

**Social Classes:**
- **Royalty:** The King's immediate family
- **High Nobility:** The Great Lords and their families (seven houses)
- **Lesser Nobility:** Barons, knights, landed gentry (~500 families)
- **Gentry:** Wealthy merchants, master craftsmen, professionals
- **Commoners:** Farmers, fishermen, laborers, servants
- **Underclass:** Beggars, criminals, foreigners without patrons

### Rights & Freedoms
**Legal Protections:**
- Right to trial before punishment
- Right to own property (subject to taxes)
- Right to practice licensed trades
- Right to petition the Crown
- Freedom of worship (with social pressure toward traditional faiths)

**Restrictions:**
- Commoners cannot bear arms without license
- Serfs cannot leave their lord's land without permission
- Foreigners require sponsors for extended stays
- Certain trades and guilds are restricted by law

**Privileges by Class:**
- Nobility: Trial by peers, right to bear arms, tax exemptions, exemption from corporal punishment
- Gentry: Some tax advantages, guild memberships, minor legal privileges
- Commoners: Basic legal protections only

### Public Services
**Infrastructure:**
- Ancient road network (deteriorating but usable)
- Harbor facilities at Lond Daer (well-maintained)
- Aqueducts and sewers in major cities (ancient, some failing)
- Fortifications throughout the kingdom

**Security:** Royal Legions garrison major towns; local lords provide village watch. Effectiveness varies wildly by location.

**Welfare:** Minimal. The Order of the Silver Flame provides charity; some noble houses support their peasants; urban poor rely on guild charity or begging.

**Education:** No public education. Nobility hire tutors; gentry use guild schools; commoners remain largely illiterate.

## Economy

### Economic System
**Type:** Feudal with growing mercantile elements

### State Involvement
**State Enterprises:**
- Royal Navy (both military and some commercial shipping)
- Royal Mint
- Royal Salt Works
- Strategic grain reserves

**Regulations:**
- Guild system controls urban trades
- Noble privileges restrict some commerce
- Tariffs and customs on all trade
- Monopolies on certain goods

**Trade Policy:** Officially supports free trade through the harbors; practically, noble interests and ancient laws create many barriers.

**Currency:** The Royal Eagle (gold), Silver Moon (silver), Copper Star (copper). The currency is trusted but somewhat debased from its original standard.

### Wealth & Resources
**Key Resources:**
- Fish (abundant coastal fisheries)
- Wool (from the High Hills)
- Stone (quality building material)
- Iron (moderate deposits in the hills)
- Grain (the Royal Demesne is fertile)

**Major Industries:**
- Shipbuilding (Lond Daer's primary industry)
- Fishing and maritime trade
- Wool and textiles
- Agriculture
- Metalworking (declining)

**Economic Health:** Declining. Trade routes are dangerous, population is falling, and ancient infrastructure requires expensive maintenance. The kingdom consumes more than it produces; the treasury balance is approximately 850,000 gold pieces but draining rapidly under Eldred's security spending.

## History

### Founding
When the survivors of the [[Age of Shadows]] emerged from the darkness, scattered groups of humans found refuge in the western coast. Around 200 RS, a warlord named Aerendor united these refugees, building [[Lond Daer]] as their capital and establishing the kingdom that bears his name. For the next three centuries, his descendants expanded eastward, creating an empire that stretched to the mountains. The kingdom's height came in the 600s-800s RS, when Aerendor's kings styled themselves Emperors of the West.

### Major Eras

**The Founding Era (~200-400 RS):**
Survival and consolidation. The first kings built the coastal cities, established noble houses, and defended against monsters and raiders. The kingdom grew slowly but steadily.

**The Golden Age (~400-800 RS):**
Expansion and glory. Aerendor's borders reached their greatest extent. The great cities were built, trade flourished, and the kingdom was the dominant human power on the continent. This is the era everyone remembers and wishes to return to.

**The Retreat (~800-1500 RS):**
Slow decline. Eastern provinces were abandoned as the population fell. Trade routes became dangerous. The kingdom contracted to its current borders. Internal conflicts weakened central authority.

**The Modern Era (~1500 RS-present):**
Stagnation and survival. The kingdom has maintained its current borders for centuries but has not grown. Successive kings have focused on defense rather than expansion. The population has stabilized at a lower level. Aerendor endures, but does not thrive.

### Recent History

**The False King's War (1947 RS):** Prince Aldred, heir to the throne, attempted to seize absolute power and reform the kingdom by force. His younger brother Eldred led the loyalist lords in a three-year civil war. When Eldred stormed the throne room, Aldred offered him one last chance to join his reforms. Eldred killed his brother instead. The victory was necessary but the kinslaying broke something in Eldred that has never healed.

**Eldred's Reign (1947 RS-present):** Forty years of defensive stability. Eldred has avoided foreign conflicts, maintained the borders, and kept the peace—at the cost of stagnation and his own mental health. His paranoia has grown steadily, especially since learning of [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]'s existence. He trusts no one completely except his daughter Elara, who increasingly handles the kingdom's actual governance while he obsesses over internal security.

**The Queen's Death (1952 RS):** Queen Miriel died giving birth to their third child—a stillborn son. Eldred blamed himself and began seeing enemies everywhere, convinced someone had cursed the birth.

### Current Situation
Aerendor is a kingdom waiting for change. [[King Eldred II]] is 62 years old, mentally deteriorating, and focused on threats that may or may not exist while real problems accumulate. [[Princess Elara]] governs in all but name, working to prepare the kingdom for her eventual succession. The treasury drains, the borders are understaffed, and something dark stirs in the eastern wilderness. The question is not whether change will come, but whether it will come through peaceful succession or violent collapse.

## Key Figures

### Current Ruler
**Name:** [[King Eldred II]]
**Title:** High King of Aerendor, Lord of the Westmark, Defender of the Realm
**Description:** A gaunt man in his early sixties who looks a decade older, perpetually in armor even in his own palace. White hair, hollow eyes, hands that never stop trembling. Once a hero who saved the kingdom from his brother's tyranny, now consumed by paranoia and grief after losing his wife and all his sons. He sees Covenant agents in every shadow, trusts no one completely except his daughter, and has withdrawn most of his forces to guard the capital while the kingdom's edges crumble.

### Royal Heir
**Name:** [[Princess Elara]]
**Position:** Crown Princess, de facto administrator of the kingdom
**Description:** A capable woman of 35 with her father's sharp mind but not his fear. She handles most daily governance while Eldred focuses on security matters. She's unmarried by choice, having rejected matches she considers unsuitable, and works quietly to prepare the kingdom for a better future. She believes something is genuinely wrong with her father—poison, curse, or magical influence—and searches for a cure.

### Major Officials

1. **Lord Chancellor Hador:** An elderly administrator who runs the bureaucracy with competent mediocrity. He supports the isolationist faction and fears change more than he fears decline.

2. **[[Lord General Kaelen]]:** Commander of the Royal Legions, a professional soldier who follows orders even when he disagrees. Loyal to the Crown but increasingly frustrated that his forces garrison the capital while the borders go undefended.

3. **High Priest Aldous:** Representative of [[The Order of the Silver Flame]], one of the few voices Eldred occasionally heeds. He counsels patience and faith while secretly worrying that the king's paranoia serves the darkness.

4. **Duke Aldric of Highwall:** The most powerful frontier lord, leader of the Restorationist faction. He wants to march east and deal with the rising threats through force. He respects the Crown but questions the King.

## Secrets

1. **The Lord Chancellor's Secretary:** Eldred's paranoia is justified—[[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] has indeed infiltrated the court. The Lord Chancellor's personal secretary, a man named Darian, is a Voice operative who has been feeding information to the Covenant for years.

2. **The King's Condition:** Eldred's deterioration may not be natural. Someone—Covenant agent, foreign power, or ambitious noble—may be poisoning or cursing him. Princess Elara suspects this but cannot prove it.

3. **The Treasury Crisis:** The true state of the treasury is worse than publicly known. At current spending rates, the kingdom will be unable to pay its legions within three years. Lord Chancellor Hador conceals this to maintain confidence.

4. **The Eastern Darkness:** Something is actively awakening in the wilderness east of Aerendor. The reports Eldred dismisses as Covenant tricks are actually describing real supernatural phenomena—phenomena connected to the weakening of the seals.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Lost Scroll:** Princess Elara wants adventurers to recover an ancient charter from a ruin in [[The Greenfields]] that proves Aerendor's claim to lost lands—and might contain information about her father's condition.

2. **The Traitor Hunt:** Someone is leaking information from the palace. The King wants outsiders to investigate—people who can't be compromised because they're not part of the court.

3. **The Shadow in the Port:** [[The Black Lotus]] is smuggling something through Lond Daer's docks. The Order of the Silver Flame suspects dark artifacts; the truth may be worse.

4. **The Succession Crisis:** A faction approaches the party about removing the King "for his own good" and installing Princess Elara as regent. Are they patriots or traitors? Does she support them?

5. **The Eastern Expedition:** Duke Aldric needs scouts to investigate reports from the wilderness. What they find will determine whether the kingdom goes to war.
