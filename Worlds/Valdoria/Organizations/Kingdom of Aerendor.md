# The Kingdom of Aerendor

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> This entity represents the primary human power in the west of Valdoria. It carries the weight of history—a noble but fading realm that remembers the glories of the past while struggling with the realities of the present. The tone should be melancholic yet dignified.

## Overview
The Kingdom of Aerendor, also known as the Sunset Kingdom, is the oldest surviving human realm in Valdoria. Once the heart of a continental empire, its borders have retreated to the coastal lands of [[The Westmark]]. It rules with a heavy emphasis on tradition and honor, though its coffers are dwindling and its great stone cities are too large for their current populations. To the east, the wilds press in; to the west, the sea offers only isolation.

## Classification

### Government Type
**Type:** Hereditary Monarchy (Feudal)

**Subtype:** Limited by the power of high nobility.

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Ancient Bloodlines / Divine Right (Claimed descent from the First Kings).

**Public Perception:** Beloved (by loyalists) / Antiquated (by the pragmatic). The people view the crown as the only thing standing between them and the chaos of the wild, but many resent the stagnation and high taxes needed to maintain ancient fortifications.

## Territory

### Extent
- **Core Territories:** The coastal plains and hills of [[The Westmark]].
- **Vassal States:** None remaining.
- **Disputed Territories:** The eastern border with [[The Greenfields]] is often blurred, with settlements drifting between royal law and independence.

### Borders
- **West:** The Great Sea (Ocean).
- **North:** The edges of [[The Pale North]] (natural barrier of cold).
- **East:** The River Anduin (or local equivalent) and the open plains of [[The Greenfields]].
- **South:** [[The Valdris Vale]] (Political border).

### Capital
**Name:** [[Lond Daer]] (See [[The Westmark]])
**Description:** A massive, ancient port city built of white stone, now gray with age. It was designed for a million souls but houses only a quarter of that.
**Why Located Here:** Excellent natural deep-water harbor and defensible cliffs.

### Major Regions
1.  **The Coastlands:** The economic heart, focused on fishing and trade.
2.  **The High Hills:** Mining and sheep herding; the military frontier.
3.  **The Royal Demesne:** The fertile lands directly surrounding the capital.

## Structure of Power

### Head of State
**Title:** High King of Aerendor
**Current Holder:** [[King Eldred II]] (The Weary)
**Selection Method:** Hereditary (Primogeniture)
**Term:** Life
**Powers:** Technically absolute, but constrained by the need for noble levies and taxes. Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Army.

### Ruling Body
**Name:** The Council of Lords
**Composition:** The heads of the 7 Great Houses, the High Priest, and the Lord Commander.
**Powers:** Advises the King; must approve major taxes and declarations of war.
**How Members Selected:** Hereditary titles + Royal appointment for military/religious posts.

### Key Offices
| Office | Holder | Responsibilities |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Lord Chancellor** | [[Lord Hador]] | Day-to-day administration and treasury |
| **Lord Commander** | [[General Kaelen]] | Leader of the Royal Legions |
| **High Justiciar** | [[Lady Elara]] | Supreme Judge and interpreter of ancient law |

### Succession
- **Line of succession:** The King's eldest child (Male preference, but females can inherit if no sons).
- **Potential crises:** The Crown Prince is young and considered "soft," more interested in old scrolls than governing.

## Administration

### Bureaucracy
- **Efficiency:** Low. Weighted down by centuries of precedent and protocol.
- **Corruption Level:** Medium. Noble privileges often override the law.

### Taxation
- **Types:** Land tax, port tariffs, "Protection Tithe."
- **Burden:** High. Maintaining the ancient fortresses is expensive.

### Military
- **Standing Army:** Small force of elite Royal Guards and city watches.
- **Wartime:** Relies on levies raised by the feudal lords.
- **Structure:** Rigid hierarchy based on birth.

## Politics

### Factions
1.  **The Restorationists:** Want to reclaim lost territories in the east. (Hawks)
2.  **The Isolationists:** Believe in fortifying the Westmark and ignoring the rest of the world. (Doves - Dominant)
3.  **The Mercantile Guilds:** Seek to erode noble power and open free trade.

### Current Issues
1.  **The Eastern Threat:** Shadow cults rising in the wilderness.
2.  **The Succession:** The King's health is failing.
3.  **Economic Stagnation:** Trade with the east has dried up.

### Foreign Policy
- **Isolationist:** Maintains polite but distant relations with the Elves of [[The Whisperwood]] and the Dwarves of [[The Sundered Peaks]].
- **Wary:** Views the "wild men" of [[The Greenfields]] with suspicion.

## Society

### Governed Population
- **Population:** ~850,000
- **Demographics:** 90% Human, 5% Halfling, 3% Dwarf, 2% Elf/Half-Elf.
- **Classes:** Strict divide between Nobility, Gentry, and Peasantry.

### Rights & Freedoms
- **Legal Protections:** Strong for citizens, weak for foreigners.
- **Religious Freedom:** Officially tolerant, but social pressure to worship the "Old Gods."

## Economy

### Economic System
**Type:** Feudal / Mercantilist

### Wealth & Resources
- **Key Resources:** Iron, Wool, Fish, Stone.
- **Major Industries:** Shipbuilding, Smithing, Agriculture.
- **Economic Health:** Declining. Ancient trade routes are dangerous or cut.

## History

### Founding
Founded by the Exiles of the First Empire who fled the great cataclysm in the east. They built [[Lond Daer]] as a refuge and convinced the local tribes to join them under the banner of the White Tree (or similar symbol).

### Current Situation
Aerendor is a "sunset kingdom." It is beautiful, civilized, and safe compared to the wild lands, but it feels like autumn. The people believe their best days are behind them.

## Key Figures

### Current Ruler
**Name:** [[King Eldred II]]
**Title:** High King of the West
**Description:** An elderly man with a sharp mind but a frail body. He has spent his reign keeping the peace and preserving what remains, but fears he has not done enough to prepare for the coming darkness.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Lost Scroll:** The Crown Prince wants adventurers to recover an ancient charter from a ruin in the [[The Greenfields]] that proves Aerendor's claim to lost lands.
2.  **The Traitor Noble:** A high-ranking lord is secretly funding bandits to destabilize the King's rule.
3.  **The Shadow in the Port:** Cultists are smuggling dark artifacts through the docks of [[Lond Daer]].
