# The Arcane Synod

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A regulatory body for magic users. Magic is "uncommon" and "feared" in Valdoria, so this organization is as much a prison/monitor as it is a school. They are the "good guys" who do questionable things to keep the world safe.

## Overview
The Arcane Synod is the primary magical authority in [[Thondorian]]. Headquartered in the coastal tower of Thalassar, they dispatch "Watchers" to every major kingdom to identify children with magical talent. These children are taken to the Spire to be trained—and to ensure they do not succumb to the corruption that often accompanies arcane power.

## Structure
**Leader:** [[Archmage Vylara]], a centuries-old Half-Elf who remembers the last time unsupervised magic nearly broke the world.
**Branches:**
1.  **The Librarians:** Hoard and study ancient texts.
2.  **The Inquisitors:** Hunt down rogue mages ("Hedge-Witches") and dark cultists.
3.  **The Artificers:** Create magical items for the Synod's use.

## Influence
**Public Perception:** People fear the Synod but call them when magical beasts or curses appear. They are seen as a necessary evil.
**Relations:**
- **[[The Kingdom of Aerendor]]:** Tense. The King dislikes their interference but needs their help against the North.
- **[[The River Compact]]:** Good. The Synod banks with the Compact.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Rogue Apprentice:** A talented student has fled the Spire with a forbidden tome; the PCs are hired to catch them before the Inquisitors do (and kill them).
2.  **The Anti-Magic Riots:** A Synod tower in [[Lond Daer]] is under siege by a mob blaming them for a recent plague.

## Image Prompts
### Headquarters
**Prompt:** A tall tower of blue-white stone rising from a rocky island, battered by waves. Magical lights spiral around the spire. Stormy sky. Cinematic, mystical, 8K.

### Symbol
**Prompt:** An open eye inside a six-pointed star, wreathed in blue flame. Silver metal texture.

## Connections
- **Headquarters:** [[Thalassar]] (Island off [[The Westmark]])
- **Enemies:** [[The Cult of the Shackled God]], [[The Realm of the Winter King]]
