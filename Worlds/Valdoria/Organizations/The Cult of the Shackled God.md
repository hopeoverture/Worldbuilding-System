# The Cult of the Shackled God

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The primary antagonist faction. They worship the "Ancient Evil" mentioned in the world hook. They are everywhere—in the slums, in the courts, in the academies. They believe the world is broken and only their god can fix it (by destroying it).

## Overview
"The Chains are heavy, but the Silence is worse." This is the whisper of the Cult. They seek to awaken a primordial entity bound beneath the world eons ago. They use blood magic, kidnapping, and political manipulation to weaken the "wards" that hold their god.

## Structure
**Leader:** [[The Prophet of Chains]]. A charismatic figure who hides his face.
**Cells:** Independent cells of 3-12 members. If one is caught, they cannot betray the others.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Missing Children:** Kids are vanishing from a city, and symbols of chains are found in the sewers.
2.  **The Corrupted Noble:** A duke is acting strangely, and his advisor wears a heavy iron necklace he never takes off.

## Image Prompts
### Symbol
**Prompt:** Detailed drawing of broken chains forming a circle. Dark, gritty, charcoal style.

## Connections
- **Enemies:** Everyone (especially [[The Order of the Silver Flame]] and [[The Arcane Synod]])
- **Master:** [[The Shackled God]] (Entity to be created?)
