# The Valdorian Explorers League

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A classic adventurers guild but focused more on archaeology and discovery than just "rat killing." They are the patrons of many PC parties.

## Overview
With so much of [[Thondorian]] covered in ruins and wilderness, the Explorers League is a vital institution. They fund expeditions, buy ancient maps, and catalog the world's wonders. Their guildhalls are museums of the bizarre and beautiful.

## Plot Hooks
