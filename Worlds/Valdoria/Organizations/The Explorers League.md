# The Valdorian Explorers League

> [!info] Character Summary
> The Valdorian Explorers League is the premier institution for adventurers, archaeologists, and cartographers across [[Thondorian]]. More than a simple adventurers' guild, the League funds expeditions into unknown territory, catalogs discoveries, maintains the most accurate maps in existence, and—secretly—collects and contains dangerous artifacts that might otherwise fall into the wrong hands. Led by the eccentric genius [[Guildmaster Garrick]], the League's guildhalls serve as museums, libraries, equipment shops, and informal adventurer banks. For those seeking glory, knowledge, or simply a paying job in dangerous places, the League is the first and last word.

## Overview

"Beyond the next horizon." This motto, engraved above every League guildhall entrance, captures the organization's driving purpose. The Valdorian Explorers League exists to push back the boundaries of the unknown—to map unmapped territories, explore unplundered ruins, and recover the lost knowledge of fallen civilizations. Founded three centuries ago by a coalition of adventurers, scholars, and merchants, the League has grown from a small club of treasure hunters into a continent-spanning institution that shapes how the civilized world understands its own history. Their guildhalls are part museum, part library, part tavern, and part mercenary recruitment center. They sponsor expeditions ranging from simple surveying jobs to suicidal descents into the deepest dungeons. And beneath their public mission of knowledge and discovery lies a more secret purpose: the League collects and contains dangerous artifacts, keeping them out of the hands of those who would misuse them—including the very governments that think they have the right to such things.

## Classification

### Type
**Guild Type:** Adventurers Guild / Archaeological Society / Cartographic Institution

**Trade/Focus:** The League specializes in exploration, archaeological recovery, map-making, and—unofficially—dangerous artifact containment. They also provide services to adventuring parties: equipment, information, contracts, and emergency rescue.

### Scope
**Operating Area:** International—the League maintains guildhalls in every major city across [[Thondorian]] and has active expeditions on every continent.

## Politics

### Internal Politics
Describe factions within:

1. **The Purists:** Believe the League should focus solely on knowledge; oppose artifact hoarding and profit motives. Led by Professor Grimm.
2. **The Pragmatists:** Support the current balance of scholarship and adventure. Led by Garrick.
3. **The Commercialists:** Want more aggressive monetization—selling more artifacts, charging higher fees. Led by Beatrix Goldring.
4. **The Interventionists:** Believe the League should use its knowledge more actively—warning governments of threats, taking action against dangers. Led by Helara Stormwind.

### External Relations

**With Government:**
Generally positive but complicated. Kingdoms appreciate League services but resent their artifact hoarding and independence. [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] has repeatedly demanded access to the Vault; the League has repeatedly refused.

**With Other Guilds:**
Cooperative with most professional guilds; mild rivalry with local adventurers' guilds who see the League as competition.

**With Merchants:**
Excellent relations with [[The River Compact]], which provides banking services and trade route information.

**With Competitors:**
The League has no real peer. Small archaeological societies exist but lack resources. Independent treasure hunters are sometimes recruited, sometimes competitors.

### Current Issues
List current challenges or debates:
1. **The Vault Debate:** Growing pressure from governments to open the Vault or at least catalog its contents publicly
2. **The Mirelands Mystery:** Multiple expeditions lost in [[The Mirelands]]; the Council debates whether to suspend operations there
3. **Covenant Infiltration:** Intelligence suggests the Covenant may have agents among members
4. **Financial Strain:** Recent expensive rescues have strained the budget

## Culture

### Values
- **Curiosity:** The unknown is not to be feared but explored
- **Preservation:** Knowledge must be protected for future generations
- **Fellowship:** League members support each other in the field and out
- **Integrity:** Accurate reporting, honest dealing, keeping one's word
- **Courage:** The League honors those who take risks in pursuit of discovery

### Traditions
1. **The First Toast:** Every expedition begins with a drink to those who didn't return
2. **The Compass Ceremony:** New members receive a brass compass marked with the League seal
3. **Wall of Names:** Every guildhall has a wall listing members lost in the field
4. **Discovery Day:** Annual celebration (autumn) where members share the year's greatest finds

### Symbols
- **Guild Emblem:** A brass compass rose superimposed on a rolled scroll, with a quill crossing diagonally
- **Colors:** Bronze, cream, and forest green
- **Motto:** "Beyond the next horizon"

### Reputation
How is the guild perceived?

- **Enemies:** The Covenant sees them as dangerous collectors of power

## History

### Founding
The Valdorian Explorers League was founded in 1420 RS by a consortium of retired adventurers, scholars, and wealthy patrons. The catalyst was the discovery of the Tomb of Valdris, a pre-Cataclysm ruin whose exploration was bungled by competing groups. The founders agreed that coordinated effort would serve everyone better than chaotic competition. They established the first guildhall in [[Rivergard]] and began formalizing expedition procedures, map standards, and artifact protocols.

### Major Events
1. **The Great Survey (1450-1480 RS):** The League's defining achievement—a systematic mapping of all major regions, creating the cartographic standards still used today
2. **The Sunken City Expedition (1523 RS):** Discovery of the underwater ruins off [[Thalassar]]; established League-Synod cooperation
3. **The Vault Founding (1560 RS):** After a League team accidentally unleashed a bound demon, the Council created the Vault to contain dangerous artifacts
4. **The Mirelands Disaster (1962 RS):** Entire expedition vanished; sparked ongoing debate about the region
5. **Garrick's Ascension (1975 RS):** Current Guildmaster elected after predecessor's death exploring [[The Pale North]]

### Current Era
The League has never been larger or more influential. Maps bearing the League seal are found in every ship's cabin and every lord's study. League expeditions push deeper into the unknown every year. But success brings challenges: governments demand more access, the Vault grows more crowded, and the recent expedition losses in the Mirelands suggest something is changing in the world. Garrick drives the League forward while watching for threats that might shatter three centuries of achievement.

## Key Figures

### Guildmaster
**Name:** [[Guildmaster Garrick]]
**Description:** A rock gnome in his late 200s, Garrick is a legend among explorers. His left arm—lost to a trap in the Tomb of the Wyrm King—has been replaced with a masterwork clockwork prosthetic of his own design, featuring multiple tool attachments and a hidden crossbow. Wild white hair frames a face creased with laugh lines and old scars. He speaks at remarkable speed, often trailing off mid-sentence as new ideas seize him. Despite his eccentricity, he has guided the League through two major crises and remains beloved by members who know he would—and has—risked his life for any of them.

### Notable Members
1. **Helara Stormwind (Master of Expeditions):** Human woman, former naval captain, famous for exploring the coastal ruins. Direct, practical, and fiercely protective of expedition teams.
2. **Professor Aldous Grimm (Curator):** Elderly human scholar, world's foremost expert on pre-Cataclysm civilizations. Pedantic but brilliant.
3. **Marcus Ironhand (Explorer):** Half-orc veteran of 40+ expeditions, known for getting teams out of impossible situations alive.
4. **"Silent" Vera (Master Explorer):** Wood elf ranger, the League's best wilderness guide. Barely speaks but her maps are works of art.

## Secrets

1. **The Vault's True Contents:** The Vault contains artifacts far more dangerous than governments suspect—including items capable of ending civilizations. A soul-binding tome. A key that opens doors to other planes. A crown that corrupts any who wear it. Garrick considers keeping these from the world his most important duty.

2. **The Mirelands Discovery:** The lost expedition actually found something—ruins containing information about [[The Shackled God]]. One survivor returned, mad, and whispered what they found before dying. Garrick has suppressed this information and suspended Mirelands operations while he decides what to do.

3. **The Covenant Spy:** A Pathfinder-rank member named Edric Ashworth (distant cousin of the Ambassador) has been recruited by the Covenant. He hasn't accessed anything truly dangerous yet, but he's working toward the Vault.

4. **Garrick's Condition:** The Guildmaster's clockwork arm is not merely mechanical—it contains a small piece of a pre-Cataclysm artifact that slowly drains his life force. Without it, he would have died decades ago; with it, he has perhaps ten years left. He has told no one.

5. **Government Arrangements:** Despite their public independence, the League has secret agreements with several governments, sharing certain discoveries in exchange for expedition rights. The Aerendor arrangement lapsed when Eldred II became too demanding; tensions are rising.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Lost Expedition:** The party is hired to find a famous exploration team that vanished in [[The Mirelands]]. They'll discover the terrible truth—and face the choice of what to report.

2. **The Race:** The League announces a massive prize for the first team to reach and map the summit of [[Zirakzigil]], highest peak in the Sundered Peaks. Rival teams compete; something ancient waits at the top.

3. **The Vault Heist:** Someone is targeting the Vault. The party must protect it—or perhaps they've been hired to break in. What they find inside will change their understanding of history.

4. **The Traitor:** Garrick approaches the party privately. He suspects a spy but can't trust anyone in the League. He needs outsiders to investigate without alerting the mole.

5. **The Clockwork Heart:** Garrick's condition worsens. The only cure is a replacement artifact from a specific ruin—one the League officially considers too dangerous to explore. The Guildmaster needs deniable assets.

6. **The Map That Shouldn't Exist:** A strange map surfaces showing a location that contradicts everything known about geography. Investigating it leads to a discovery that could rewrite history—or uncover a clever forgery meant to lure explorers to their deaths.

7. **The Museum Theft:** Something has been stolen from the Grand Gallery—something that was supposed to be mundane but apparently wasn't. The party must recover it before its true nature becomes apparent.
