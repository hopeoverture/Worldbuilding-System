# The Free Towns of the East

> [!info] Character Summary
> The Free Towns are not a nation but an absence of one—a collection of independent fortified settlements in [[The Eastern Frontier]], each ruled by whatever strong leader can hold it. Mayors, barons, warlords, and merchant princes control individual towns while a weak Frontier Council provides a forum for occasional cooperation against common threats. This is a land of opportunity and danger, where fortunes are made and lost overnight, where exiles and adventurers can build empires or die trying, and where the only law is what you can enforce. It's the Wild West of Valdoria, with orcs instead of the Comanche.

## Overview

Beyond the orderly kingdoms of the west lies a land where kings hold no authority and no lord can trace his lineage back more than three generations. [[The Eastern Frontier]] is a patchwork of fortified towns, each an island of civilization in a sea of wilderness, ruins, and orc territory. These Free Towns owe allegiance to no monarch, pay taxes to no distant capital, and follow no law but their own. Some are ruled by elected councils; others by merchant princes, retired adventurers, or outright warlords. They fight each other nearly as often as they fight the orcs, forming and breaking alliances with dizzying speed. Yet somehow, this chaotic system persists. The towns survive because they must—because the alternative is annihilation by the [[Ashlands]] hordes—and because the frontier attracts exactly the kind of hard, resourceful, and ruthless people who thrive in chaos. For those with nothing to lose, the Free Towns offer everything; for those with everything to protect, they offer only terror.

## Classification

### Government Type
**Type:** Loose Confederation of City-States

**Subtype:** Anarchic / Competitive

Each town is effectively an independent entity. The "Free Towns" is more a geographic description than a political one. The only unifying institution is the Frontier Council, which has advisory power only and can be—and frequently is—ignored.

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Varies by town—conquest, wealth, election, intimidation, or simply being the one who survived longest

**Public Perception:** The people accept whatever leader can keep them alive. Loyalty is practical, not ideological. Most residents came here specifically to escape the rules of "proper" kingdoms.

## Territory

### Extent
Describe the lands under this government's control:
- **Core Territories:** A chain of fortified towns along the eastern trade routes, typically a day's ride apart
- **Claimed Lands:** Everything between the Riddle-Mark's eastern border and the Ashlands, though "claimed" is a strong word for territory patrolled only sporadically
- **Disputed Territories:** The borders with [[The Riddle-Mark]] are constantly contested; the Ashlands are in permanent low-level war

### Borders
Describe border security and neighboring powers:
- **Western Border:** The Riddle-Mark horsemen patrol their side aggressively; the Free Towns don't have the resources to do the same
- **Eastern Border:** The Ashlands—no defined border, just a gradient from "dangerous" to "suicidal"
- **Northern Border:** Mountains containing Orc holds and ancient ruins
- **Southern Border:** Eventually becomes The Mirelands; few travel that way

### Capital
**Name:** None (de jure); Ironholt (de facto, as Council meeting place)

**Description:** Ironholt is the largest and most defensible Free Town, built in the ruins of a dwarven outpost. It hosts the Frontier Council meetings by virtue of having walls thick enough to guarantee attendees' safety.

**Why Located Here:** Dwarven stonework, central location, and the iron mines that give it economic importance

### Major Towns
List 5-6 significant settlements:

1. **Ironholt:** The largest Free Town (~12,000 pop). Built on dwarven ruins with iron mines. Currently ruled by Baron Tormund, a retired adventurer who conquered it from the previous lord.

2. **Dustwatch:** A trading post town (~6,000 pop) controlling the main route to the Riddle-Mark. Ruled by the Merchant Council, three wealthy trading families who manage not to kill each other.

3. **The Stake:** A notorious lawless town (~4,000 pop) that serves as a black market and haven for criminals. Whoever controls the Stake controls frontier smuggling. Currently held by "The Queen of Thieves," identity unknown.

4. **Fort Brassard:** A military garrison town (~3,500 pop) founded by a [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] expeditionary force that went native. Still maintains military discipline under General Marcus Vrell.

5. **Ruin's Edge:** An adventurer's town (~5,000 pop) built near major pre-Cataclysm ruins. Economy is entirely based on dungeon delving. Loosely democratic; the Delvers' Assembly makes decisions.

6. **Grimhaven:** A grim fortress town (~3,000 pop) on the Ashlands border. Under constant orc threat. Ruled by whoever can hold the walls; currently Warlord Gretta the Grim, a half-orc warrior.

## Structure of Power

### Head of State
**Title:** None unified; each town has its own leader with its own title

**Current Holders:** See Major Towns above

**Selection Method:** Varies wildly—conquest, election, purchase, inheritance (rare), or simply being the last one standing

**Term:** Until death, overthrow, or departure

**Powers:** Within their town, Town Masters have absolute authority. Outside it, they have influence proportional to their military and economic strength.

### Ruling Body
*The Frontier Council—an advisory body.*

**Name:** The Frontier Council

**Composition:** Representatives from any town that chooses to send one; typically 8-12 attendees

**Powers:** Advisory only. Can call for cooperation, share intelligence, and negotiate mutual defense pacts. Cannot tax, legislate, or command troops.

**How Members Selected:** Appointed by individual Town Masters; some send themselves, others send trusted seconds

### Key Offices
The Council has no permanent offices, only ad hoc roles:

| Role | Current Holder | Responsibilities |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Council Host | Baron Tormund (Ironholt) | Provides meeting venue and security |
| War Speaker | Warlord Gretta (Grimhaven) | Coordinates defense against orc threats |
| Trade Arbiter | Merchant Aldric Dunn (Dustwatch) | Mediates commercial disputes |

### Succession
Describe how power transfers:
- **In most towns:** The strong replace the weak. Succession crises are constant.
- **Ironholt:** Tormund has named no heir; at least four people plan to seize power when he dies
- **Fort Brassard:** Military promotion; the senior surviving officer takes command
- **Recent successions:** Four Town Masters died in the past year—three by violence, one by plague

## Administration

### Bureaucracy
Describe the administrative apparatus:
- **Regional level:** None exists
- **Town level:** Varies from sophisticated (Fort Brassard keeps detailed records) to primitive (Grimhaven governs by the Warlord's word)
- **Corruption level:** Extreme everywhere except Fort Brassard
- **Record keeping:** Generally poor; the Frontier attracts people who don't want records

### Taxation
Describe revenue collection:
- **Types of taxes:** Each town sets its own—typically tolls on trade, protection fees on residents, and "contributions" from businesses
- **Collection methods:** Armed collectors; refusal is not healthy
- **Tax burden on populace:** Variable but generally moderate—no one comes to the Frontier for high taxes
- **Major revenue sources:** Trade tolls, mining (Ironholt), dungeon loot sales (Ruin's Edge), smuggling fees (The Stake)

### Law & Justice
Describe the legal system:
- **Law codes:** Each town has its own; most are simple (don't kill, don't steal, do what the boss says)
- **Courts and judges:** Town Masters or their appointees; trials are fast and often arbitrary
- **Punishments:** Death, exile, fines, or impressment into defense forces; imprisonment is rare (too expensive)
- **Rights:** Citizens have whatever rights their Town Master grants; outsiders have fewer

### Military
Describe armed forces:
- **Standing armies:** Each town maintains its own militia; total ~8,000 under arms across all towns
- **Command structure:** Town Masters command their own forces; no unified command exists
- **Quality:** Ranges from excellent (Fort Brassard) to barely armed mobs (smaller towns)
- **Conscription:** Universal in most towns during orc incursions; otherwise varies

## Politics

### Factions
List 3-5 political factions within the government:

1. **The Consolidators:** Want to unify the Free Towns into a proper nation with real government. Led by Baron Tormund. Opposed by nearly everyone who came here to escape government.

2. **The Isolationists:** Each town for itself; the Council should remain purely advisory. Led by the Merchant Council of Dustwatch. The dominant faction.

3. **The Militarists:** Believe survival requires unified military command to defeat the orcs. Led by General Vrell. Gaining support as orc raids worsen.

4. **The Expansionists:** Want to take the fight to the Ashlands, conquer orc territory, and grow the Frontier. Led by Warlord Gretta. Considered suicidal by most.

5. **The Criminal Alliance:** An informal network connecting smugglers, thieves, and black marketeers across all towns. The Queen of Thieves coordinates. They oppose any centralization that might interfere with business.

### Current Issues
List major political debates or conflicts:

1. **Orc Surge:** Raids from the Ashlands are intensifying. Something is driving the orcs west. The Council debates unified response vs. individual defense.

2. **Dustwatch-Stake War:** A trade dispute between Dustwatch and The Stake has escalated into armed skirmishes. Other towns are being pressured to take sides.

3. **Aerendor Influence:** Fort Brassard maintains ties to the [[Kingdom of Aerendor]], which some suspect of wanting to annex the Frontier. General Vrell denies this; others are unconvinced.

4. **Missing Expeditions:** Multiple groups exploring the northern ruins have vanished. Ruin's Edge is concerned about its primary industry.

### Foreign Policy
Describe approach to other powers:
- **[[The Kingdom of Aerendor]]:** Distant and complicated. Officially, Aerendor has no claim; unofficially, they'd love to expand. Fort Brassard serves as an unofficial embassy.
- **[[The Riddle-Mark]]:** Tense. Horse Lords raid Frontier caravans; Frontier settlers encroach on claimed grazing lands.
- **[[The Ashlands]]:** Permanent war, though usually low-intensity
- **[[The River Compact]]:** Limited trade; Compact merchants find the Frontier too chaotic

## Society

### Governed Population
Describe who lives under this government:
- **Population size:** ~150,000 across all towns and scattered homesteads
- **Major demographics:** Human 70%, Half-orc 15%, Other 15%
- **Social classes:** The armed and the unarmed; those who rule and those who survive
- **Minorities:** Half-orcs are common (proximity to Ashlands); small populations of dwarves (miners), gnomes (tinkers), halflings (merchants)

### Rights & Freedoms
Describe what subjects can expect:
- **Legal protections:** Whatever your Town Master provides; justice is personal, not institutional
- **Restrictions:** Few—the Frontier attracts those who want to live without restrictions
- **Privileges:** Strength brings privilege; weakness invites exploitation
- **Religious freedom:** Complete; the gods of the Frontier are as varied as its people

### Public Services
Describe what the government provides:
- **Infrastructure:** Walls, roads within town, wells—nothing between towns
- **Security:** Town militia for internal order and orc defense
- **Welfare:** None; if you can't work, you leave or die
- **Education:** Private tutors for the wealthy; apprenticeships for trades; literacy is uncommon

## Economy

### Economic System
**Type:** Free Market (Extremely Free)

The Frontier has no economic regulation. If you can sell it, someone will buy it. Slavery is technically illegal in most towns but enforcement is lax. Smuggling is a major industry.

### State Involvement
Describe government role in economy:
- **State enterprises:** None across the Frontier; some towns control specific resources (Ironholt's mines)
- **Regulations:** Minimal; each town sets its own trade rules
- **Trade policy:** Free and chaotic
- **Currency:** Mixed—Aerendor gold, Compact silver, dwarven marks, and barter all circulate

### Wealth & Resources
Describe economic foundation:
- **Key resources:** Iron ore (Ironholt), pre-Cataclysm salvage (Ruin's Edge), trade route tolls (Dustwatch), contraband (The Stake)
- **Major industries:** Mining, salvage archaeology, mercenary services, ranching (limited), smuggling
- **Trade goods:** Iron, recovered artifacts, mercenaries for export; grain, weapons, finished goods imported
- **Economic health:** Volatile but resilient; individual towns boom and bust constantly

## History

### Founding
The Free Towns emerged gradually over the past century as adventurers, refugees, and fortune-seekers pushed into [[The Eastern Frontier]]. The first permanent settlements appeared around 1890 RS, built on defensible positions or near valuable resources. The Frontier Council was established in 1925 RS after three towns were destroyed by a coordinated orc assault—the survivors realized minimal cooperation was necessary for survival.

### Major Eras
Describe 2-3 significant periods:

**The Wild Years (1890-1925 RS):**
The initial settlement period, marked by constant violence between human factions and orcs. Dozens of towns rose and fell. Survival rates for new settlements were below 40%.

**The Council Period (1925-present):**
After the Three Towns Massacre, the surviving settlements created the Frontier Council. Cooperation remains minimal, but the existence of a forum for negotiation has reduced inter-town warfare and improved coordination against orcs.

### Recent History
The past decade has seen concerning changes. Orc raids from the Ashlands have intensified dramatically since around 1980 RS. Several experienced adventuring companies exploring the northern ruins have vanished without trace. Trade with the Riddle-Mark has declined as that kingdom focuses inward. And Fort Brassard has been quietly receiving supplies from Aerendor, leading some to fear annexation.

### Current Situation
The Free Towns stand at a crossroads. The worsening orc threat demands greater cooperation, but the fierce independence that defines the Frontier resists any centralization. Baron Tormund pushes for unity; the Merchant Council of Dustwatch opposes him; Warlord Gretta just wants enough troops to hold Grimhaven. Meanwhile, unknown forces are moving in the northern ruins, the Queen of Thieves expands her network, and someone is funding the aggressive new gang from the Frontier that's pushing into [[The River Compact]]'s territory.

## Key Figures

### Baron Tormund (Ironholt)
**Name:** Baron Tormund Blackiron
**Title:** Baron of Ironholt (self-styled)
**Description:** A massive human man in his fifties, Tormund conquered Ironholt fifteen years ago with an adventuring company turned warband. He has spent since then building it into the closest thing the Frontier has to a proper city. Gruff, pragmatic, and surprisingly patient for a former adventurer, he genuinely believes unification is necessary for survival—but knows that forcing it would just create more enemies. His iron-grey beard, scarred face, and the massive greatsword he still carries mark him as dangerous despite his administrative role.

### The Queen of Thieves (The Stake)
**Name:** Unknown; possibly multiple people using the title
**Position:** De facto ruler of The Stake and coordinator of Frontier organized crime
**Description:** No one knows who the Queen actually is. She—or they—communicate through intermediaries and coded messages. Theories range from a single mastermind to a council of crime lords sharing the identity. What's certain is that the Queen's network operates in every Free Town, controls most smuggling, and has eyes and ears everywhere. She opposes unification because it would be bad for business.

### Major Officials
List 3-4 important figures:

1. **General Marcus Vrell (Fort Brassard):** Former Aerendor officer who led an expeditionary force east, decided he preferred the Frontier, and "retired" with his men. Maintains professional military discipline in a sea of chaos. His true loyalty—to the Frontier or to distant Aerendor—is questioned.

2. **Merchant Aldric Dunn (Dustwatch):** The most influential member of Dustwatch's Merchant Council, controlling the route to the Riddle-Mark. Wealthy, cautious, and opposed to any policy that might disrupt profitable chaos.

3. **Warlord Gretta the Grim (Grimhaven):** A half-orc warrior who has held Grimhaven's walls against orc assault for five years. Respected even by those who despise half-orcs. Advocates for aggressive expansion into Ashlands territory.

4. **"Pickaxe" Morran (Ruin's Edge):** A legendary dungeon delver who effectively leads the Delvers' Assembly. His discoveries have made Ruin's Edge prosperous; his warnings about something stirring in the deep ruins have been ignored.

## Secrets

List 2-3 hidden truths about this government:

1. **General Vrell's Orders:** Fort Brassard's commanding officer has secret orders from [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] to prepare for "integration" of the Free Towns if the orc threat grows severe enough to justify intervention. Vrell is torn between his orders and his genuine attachment to the Frontier.

2. **The Queen's Identity:** The Queen of Thieves is actually three people: Lysa Darkhollow (intelligence), Marcus the Fence (logistics), and a retired assassin known only as "Grandmother" (enforcement). They created the singular identity to prevent rivals from targeting any one leader.

3. **What Drives the Orcs:** The intensifying orc raids are not random aggression—something in the Ashlands is driving them westward. Scouts who've gone deep report ruins awakening, strange lights, and orcs speaking of "the Hungry Dark." The Covenant has begun operations in the region.

4. **The Northern Discovery:** Pickaxe Morran found something in the deep ruins—texts describing [[The Shackled God]] and the location of a seal. He hasn't reported this to anyone; instead, he's been quietly recruiting trusted delvers for a secret expedition.

## Plot Hooks

List 3-4 adventure opportunities:

1. **The Power Void:** Baron Tormund is dying (poison, though he doesn't know who). His death will trigger a succession crisis. The party can back a candidate, play kingmaker, or try to find the poisoner before it's too late.

2. **The Orc Tide:** A massive warband is gathering in the Ashlands—larger than any seen in generations. The towns must unite or fall. The party is tasked with forging an alliance from factions that hate each other.

3. **The Frontier Gang:** A violent new gang from the Free Towns has been pushing into [[The River Compact]]'s territory with unusual resources. Someone is funding them. Investigation leads back to the Frontier—and suggests the Covenant is involved.

4. **The Deep Expedition:** Pickaxe Morran approaches the party secretly. He's found something huge in the northern ruins but doesn't trust local delvers. He needs outsiders for a dangerous expedition that could change everything.

5. **The Missing Companies:** Three experienced adventuring groups have vanished in the northern ruins. The Delvers' Assembly offers a reward for information. What the party finds will reveal a threat no one suspected.

6. **The Queen's Game:** The Queen of Thieves contacts the party through intermediaries. She has a job that serves both her interests and theirs—but working with her means becoming entangled in Frontier underworld politics.
