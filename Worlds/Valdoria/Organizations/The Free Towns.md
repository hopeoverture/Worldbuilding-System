# The Free Towns of the East

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A lawless region of independent towns, robber barons, and adventurers. "The Border Princes" meets the Wild West. No central authority, just chaos and opportunity.

## Overview
[[The Eastern Frontier]] is ruled by no king. It is a collection of independent fortified towns, each ruled by a Mayor, Baron, or Warlord. They fight each other as often as they fight the Orcs. It is a haven for exiles, mercenaries, and those running from the law.

## Structure
**Governance:** Each town is independent. Alliances are fleeting.
**Economy:** Looting, scavenging ruins, and high-risk trade.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Power Void:** A powerful warlord has died, and three rivals are fighting for his town.
2.  **The Orc Tide:** A massive warband is approaching, and the towns refuse to unite.

## Connections
- **Territory:** [[The Eastern Frontier]]
- **Neighbors:** [[The Riddle-Mark]], [[The Ashlands]]
