# The Grey Wardens

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A mix of Rangers (Strider) and Druids who watch the wild places. They act as guides and guardians, often mediating between civilization and nature.

## Overview
The Grey Wardens are rarely seen but often felt. A warning arrow in a tree trunk, a campfire left burning for a lost traveler, a bridge repaired overnight. They patrol the borders of [[The Whisperwood]] and [[The Greenfields]], ensuring that the beasts of the wild do not encroach on the towns, and that loggers do not cut too deep.

## Structure
**Leader:** [[High Druid Elara]]. A Wood Elf who rarely speaks to non-druids.
**Methods:** Guerrilla warfare, nature magic, animal companions.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Corrupted Grove:** Something is twisting the trees in the north; the Wardens need outsiders to investigate because their magic is being dampened.
2.  **The Escort:** A Warden hires the party to help move a herd of rare beasts through a war zone.

## Image Prompts
### Symbol
**Prompt:** A grey cloak clasp in the shape of a leaf. Simple, tarnished silver.

## Connections
- **Territory:** [[The Whisperwood]], [[The Greenfields]]
- **Allies:** [[The Kingdom of Aerendor]] (sometimes)
