# The Iron Holds

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The archetypal Dwarven stronghold. Ancient, immovable, and rich. They care little for the surface world unless it involves trade or Orcs. "Moria before the fall."

## Overview
The Iron Holds are a series of fortress-cities carved beneath [[The Sundered Peaks]]. United under the High King in Karak-Zul, they are the masters of stonework and metal. They are currently locked in a centuries-long war of attrition with the Goblins and Orcs of the lower deeps.
