# The Iron Holds

> [!info] Character Summary
> The ancient dwarven kingdom beneath [[The Sundered Peaks]], the Iron Holds have endured for three millennia through stubborn determination and impregnable fortifications. Once masters of tunnel networks stretching beneath the entire continent, they now fight a bitter war of attrition against the Orc hordes that drove them from their deepest halls. Under [[High King Thrain IV]]'s grim leadership, the Holds prioritize survival over expansion, hoarding their strength while the king plans a final, desperate bid to reclaim the lost territories.

## Overview

The Iron Holds comprise seven great fortress-cities carved into the roots of [[The Sundered Peaks]], connected by miles of defensible tunnels that have never been breached by enemy force. For three thousand years, the dwarves have ruled the deep places, extracting gold, mithril, and adamantine while crafting works of such quality that surface races measure their own achievements against dwarven standards. But the glory days are memory now. The Great Siege a century ago cost thirty thousand lives and shattered the kingdom's confidence. The Fall of the Deep Roads fifty years later severed access to the Tombs of the Ancestors and the richest mining territories. Today, the Holds are a kingdom in defensive crouch—wealthy beyond measure but afraid to spend that wealth, numerous enough to field great armies but too wary to commit them. [[High King Thrain IV]] sits on the Stone Throne planning vengeance, while his people wonder if the greatest dwarven kingdom will become the greatest dwarven tomb.

## Classification

### Government Type
**Type:** Hereditary Monarchy

**Subtype:** Clan-Based Federation—the High King rules as supreme authority, but each of the seven great clans governs its own Hold with considerable autonomy. The Thane-Moot can overrule the King only on matters where he violates the ancient Stone Laws.

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Divine Ancestry—the royal line claims direct descent from Durin the Deathless, the first dwarf created by the Maker himself. The Stone Crown recognizes true heirs; it fits no usurper's brow.

**Public Perception:** Unquestioned faith in the institution, growing concern about the current king. Dwarves say "The King is the Mountain"—immovable, eternal, the foundation of all things. But whispers suggest this particular king may be a mountain crumbling.

## Territory

### Extent
**Core Territories:**
- The seven Great Holds carved into the central Sundered Peaks
- The Upper Deeps—mine tunnels and worked galleries to 3,000 feet depth
- The Crossroads—connecting tunnels between Holds

**Lost Territories (Claimed but Not Held):**
- The Deep Roads—ancient highways in the mountain roots, lost to Orcs
- The Lower Deeps—richest mining areas, abandoned 50 years ago
- The Tombs of the Ancestors—sacred burial halls, defiled and occupied

**Vassal/Dependent Territories:**
- Surface mining camps at mountain passes
- Trading posts at [[Highwall]] and other border settlements
- The Gate-Keeps—surface fortresses guarding main entrances

### Borders
**Natural Boundaries:**
- Above: The mountain peaks and snowline (uninhabited)
- Below: The Orc-held Deep Roads (contested)
- East/West: Solid rock and collapsed tunnels (sealed)

**Fortified Borders:**
- The Great Gates—seven massive doors, each Hold's primary defense
- The Seal-Walls—emergency barriers in connecting tunnels
- The Deep Watch—fortified positions facing the lost territories

**Border Disputes:**
- The Orc Frontier: Constant skirmishing along the edge of controlled territory
- Surface Claims: Occasional disputes with [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] over mountain passes

**Relations with Neighbors:**
- [[Kingdom of Aerendor]]: Bitter distrust since the Great Siege; Thrain refuses alliance
- [[The River Compact]]: Active trade relations; the only surface power treated cordially
- Orc Hordes: Eternal war, no negotiation, no mercy

### Capital
**Name:** [[Karak-Zul]] (Deep-hold, the Throne City)

**Description:** The greatest surviving dwarven city, carved entirely within Mount Karak over two thousand years. The city rises in tiers inside a hollowed mountain chamber so vast that clouds form beneath its ceiling. Magma channels provide heat and light, supplemented by thousands of crystal lamps powered by ancient enchantments. Great stone bridges span the central chasm, connecting the residential tiers to the workshops and forges below. At the highest point sits the Throne Hall, where the Stone Crown passes from king to king. Population: approximately 80,000.

**Why Located Here:** Karak-Zul sits atop the richest mithril seam in the known world. The Maker himself supposedly led Durin here, pointing to where the dwarves should delve.

### Major Holds
The seven Great Holds, each ruled by a Thane:

1. **Karak-Zul (The Throne City):** Capital, seat of the High King, center of administration and the mithril trade. Thane: The High King (double role). Population: ~80,000.

2. **Karak-Varn (The Forge City):** Primary weapons and armor production, home to the great foundries. Thane: Borin Ironhand. Population: ~60,000.

3. **Karak-Azgal (The Gold City):** Oldest treasury vaults, center of banking and jewel-craft. Thane: Durak Goldbeard. Population: ~45,000.

4. **Karak-Hirn (The Horn City):** Eastern Hold, primary trading gateway with surface races. Thane: [[Thane Borgin]]. Population: ~40,000.

5. **Karak-Kadrin (The Slayer City):** Warrior-focused Hold, trains elite fighters, home to the cult of the Slayers. Thane: Gotrek Gurnisson. Population: ~35,000.

6. **Karak-Izor (The Copper City):** Southern Hold, copper and tin mining, machinery production. Thane: Thorek Bronzebeard. Population: ~25,000.

7. **Karak-Eight-Peaks (The Lost City):** Formerly largest Hold, partially reclaimed but still contested with Orcs. Thane: Position vacant (death toll too high). Population: ~15,000 defenders.

## Structure of Power

### Head of State
**Title:** High King Under the Mountain, Lord of All Holds, Guardian of the Stone Crown

**Current Holder:** [[High King Thrain IV]], called "The Stone-Father" or "The Grieving King"

**Selection Method:** Hereditary within the royal line of Durin. The Stone Crown itself confirms legitimacy—it will not rest on an unworthy or false heir's brow.

**Term:** Life. The High King rules until death; abdication is unknown in dwarven history.

**Powers:**
- Supreme military command
- Final judicial authority
- Power to summon the Thane-Moot
- Sole authority over foreign policy
- Guardian of the Stone Laws (but cannot change them)

### Ruling Body
**Name:** The Thane-Moot

**Composition:** The seven Thanes (lords of each Great Hold), plus the High Priest of the Maker and the Master of the Guilds.

**Powers:**
- Advise the High King on all matters
- Veto royal decrees that violate the Stone Laws (requires 7 of 9 votes)
- Elect a regent if the King is incapacitated
- Confirm the succession if the heir is disputed
- Declare Grudges (formal blood feuds) against external enemies

**How Members Selected:** Thanes are hereditary rulers of their clan-holds. The High Priest is chosen by the temple hierarchy. The Master of the Guilds is elected by guild masters.

### Key Offices

| Office | Holder | Responsibilities |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| High King | [[High King Thrain IV]] | Supreme authority, military command, foreign policy |
| Thane of the Eastern Holds | [[Thane Borgin]] | Rules Karak-Hirn, manages surface trade, King's oldest friend |
| Master of the Deep Watch | General Kargan Trollslayer | Commands forces facing the Orc frontier |
| High Priest of the Maker | Runelord Kragg | Spiritual leadership, interprets divine will |
| Master of the Guilds | Guildmaster Thorin Silverbeard | Oversees all craft production, economic policy |
| Keeper of the Grudges | Archivist Snorri | Maintains the Book of Grudges, tracks all debts owed |
| Royal Heir | [[Princess Brunhild]] | Princess, sole surviving heir, kept from danger |

### Succession
**Line of Succession:**
1. [[Princess Brunhild]] (granddaughter, only surviving heir)
2. [[Thane Borgin]] (distant cousin, would serve as regent)
3. Disputed among Thanes (would likely trigger succession crisis)

**Selection Process:** The eldest legitimate heir inherits automatically. The Stone Crown confirms legitimacy by fitting properly. If no clear heir exists, the Thane-Moot selects from eligible candidates.

**Recent Successions:** Thrain IV inherited from his father Thrain III 150 years ago after a peaceful death. The succession was uncontested.

**Potential Crises:** Thrain has lost three sons and has only one grandchild. If Brunhild dies without heirs, the royal line of Durin ends. Some Thanes quietly position themselves for possible succession wars.

## Administration

### Bureaucracy
**Size and Efficiency:** Massive and meticulous. The dwarven bureaucracy tracks every ounce of gold, every yard of tunnel, every birth and death across all seven Holds.

**Key Departments:**
- The Treasury (taxation, coinage, debt tracking)
- The Registry (population records, property rights, inheritance)
- The Guild Office (craft licenses, quality standards, trade permits)
- The Deep Watch Office (military logistics, tunnel maintenance, defenses)

**Corruption Level:** Extremely low. Dwarven society considers corruption a form of theft, punished by exile or worse. The bureaucracy's obsessive record-keeping makes hiding malfeasance nearly impossible.

**Record Keeping:** Legendary. Records survive from the First Age. Every transaction, every judgment, every grudge is carved in stone and preserved forever.

### Taxation
**Types of Taxes:**
- Mining Tithe: 15% of all extracted precious metals to the High King
- Craft Tax: 10% of all finished goods value
- Gate Tolls: Fees on all goods passing between Holds
- Surface Trade Tax: 20% on all trade with non-dwarves

**Collection Methods:** Rigid assessment by Treasury officials. No negotiation. No exceptions. Evasion is treated as theft.

**Tax Burden:** Moderate. The wealthy mines and craftworks generate enormous revenue; individual dwarves feel the burden mainly through craft taxes.

**Major Revenue Sources:**
- Mithril exports (40% of treasury income)
- Weapons and armor trade (25%)
- Precious gems and jewelry (20%)
- Banking services and loans (15%)

### Law & Justice
**Law Codes:** The Stone Laws, carved in the foundation of Karak-Zul at the kingdom's founding. Unchangeable even by the High King. Additional laws exist but cannot contradict the Stone Laws.

**Courts and Judges:** Each Hold maintains courts staffed by appointed judges. Appeals go to the Thane, then to the High King. Serious crimes (murder, treason, theft of significant value) are heard by the Thane-Moot.

**Punishments:**
- Minor offenses: Fines, public shaming
- Theft: Loss of the offending hand, exile for major theft
- Murder: Death by axe or exile to the Deep (effectively death)
- Treason: Stricken from all records, unmentioned forever (worse than death to dwarves)

**Rights:**
- All dwarves have right to craft practice and fair prices
- All dwarves may appeal to their Thane
- Non-dwarves have no legal standing; they exist at dwarven sufferance

### Military
**Standing Army:** Approximately 40,000 professional soldiers across all Holds, plus 80,000 militia who can be called in emergency.

**Elite Units:**
- The Ironbreakers: Heavy infantry in ancient gromril armor, the kingdom's finest warriors (~5,000)
- The Wardens of Stone: Royal guard, protect the High King and royal family (~500)
- The Slayers: Death-seeking warriors who have sworn to die gloriously against enemies (~2,000)
- The Thunderers: Crossbow specialists using masterwork repeating crossbows (~8,000)

**Command Structure:** The High King holds supreme command. The Master of the Deep Watch commands frontier forces. Each Thane commands their Hold's garrison.

**Conscription:** No conscription. Military service is voluntary but heavily honored. Most dwarven families have tradition of at least one son serving.

## Politics

### Factions

1. **The Isolationists (The Sealers)**
   - **Goals:** Close the gates, cut ties with surface races, focus entirely on internal defense
   - **Methods:** Political pressure in Thane-Moot, refusing trade deals
   - **Leader:** Thane Durak Goldbeard of Karak-Azgal
   - **Influence:** Strong among older dwarves traumatized by the Great Siege

2. **The Reclaimers (The Deep Lords)**
   - **Goals:** Launch massive offensive to retake the Deep Roads and Tombs of the Ancestors
   - **Methods:** Lobbying the King (who is sympathetic), military buildup, recruiting Slayers
   - **Leader:** General Kargan Trollslayer (with tacit royal support)
   - **Influence:** Dominant in Karak-Kadrin, growing elsewhere as frustration mounts

3. **The Traders (The Surface Friends)**
   - **Goals:** Increase commerce with [[The River Compact]] and other surface powers, modernize
   - **Methods:** Economic arguments, showcasing trade benefits, diplomatic outreach
   - **Leader:** [[Thane Borgin]] of Karak-Hirn
   - **Influence:** Strong in eastern Holds, resisted in the deep interior

4. **The Grudge-Keepers (The Rememberers)**
   - **Goals:** Maintain all ancient grievances, refuse reconciliation with any who wronged the Holds
   - **Methods:** Public recitations of grudges, opposing any alliance with [[Kingdom of Aerendor]]
   - **Leader:** Archivist Snorri (holds the Book of Grudges)
   - **Influence:** Cultural power; no dwarf publicly opposes honoring grudges

### Current Issues

1. **The Succession Crisis:** With only [[Princess Brunhild]] remaining, the royal line is one accident from extinction. Thrain refuses to discuss it; others plan quietly.

2. **The Deep Roads Offensive:** The King plans a massive assault. Some Thanes support reclaiming ancestral territory; others fear catastrophic losses.

3. **The Aerendor Question:** Should the Holds accept King Eldred's trade proposals despite the betrayal during the Great Siege? Borgin says yes; Thrain says never.

4. **The Deep Stirrings:** Something is driving the Orcs upward in greater numbers. Miners report strange sounds from sealed tunnels. The cause is unknown but feared.

### Foreign Policy
**General Approach:** Isolationist and suspicious. The Holds trade grudgingly and ally with no one.

**Alliances:** None formal. The closest relationship is with [[The River Compact]], which the Holds view as acceptably neutral.

**Rivalries:**
- [[Kingdom of Aerendor]]: Bitter over the Great Siege betrayal. Thrain refuses direct dealings.
- Orc Tribes: Eternal war. No negotiation is possible or desired.

**Trade Relationships:**
- [[The River Compact]]: Primary trading partner. Mithril and weapons for food, timber, and surface goods.
- [[Highwall]]: Grudging commerce through the garrison town.
- Others: Minimal, through intermediaries.

**Diplomatic Style:** Dwarves state their terms and expect acceptance. They do not bargain, do not compromise, and never forget a slight. Foreign ambassadors often leave frustrated or offended.

## Society

### Governed Population
**Population Size:** Approximately 300,000 dwarves across all Holds

**Major Demographics:**
- Mountain Dwarves: 95% (native to the Holds)
- Hill Dwarves: 4% (immigrants from surface settlements)
- Others: 1% (gnome engineers, human craftsmen with special permits)

**Social Classes:**
- **The Royal Line:** The High King's family and close kin
- **The Thane-Lords:** Ruling clans of each Hold
- **The Craft-Masters:** Guild masters and master artisans
- **The Common Delvers:** Miners, soldiers, workers
- **The Clanless:** Those expelled from their clans; effectively non-persons

**Minorities:** Non-dwarves may reside in the Holds with special permits but have no legal standing. They cannot own property, join guilds, or remain without a dwarven sponsor.

### Rights & Freedoms
**Legal Protections:**
- Right to practice one's craft
- Right to fair prices for work
- Right to appeal judgments to higher authority
- Protection of clan property
- Right to record and pursue grudges

**Restrictions:**
- No dwarf may teach craft secrets to outsiders
- No dwarf may marry outside the species (exile offense)
- No dwarf may speak ill of the Maker or ancestors
- No dwarf may surrender in battle (death preferred)

**Privileges by Class:** Thane-Lords have judicial authority over their clans. Craft-Masters set prices and standards. Common dwarves have fewer privileges but the same basic protections.

**Religious Freedom:** None. All dwarves honor the Maker. Other worship is forbidden (though rarely prosecuted if private).

### Public Services
**Infrastructure:** The Holds maintain:
- Tunnel networks connecting all major areas
- Magma channels for heating and lighting
- Water systems from underground rivers
- Lift systems for vertical transport

**Security:** The Deep Watch guards the Orc frontier. Internal security is maintained by Hold guards and the social pressure of tight-knit clans.

**Welfare:** No formal system, but clans care for their members. Orphans are adopted; disabled veterans are honored. No dwarf starves unless they've been cast out.

**Education:** Guild apprenticeships teach crafts. Temples teach history and religion. Formal schools exist only for nobility.

## Economy

### Economic System
**Type:** Guild-Controlled Market Economy—free enterprise within strict guild regulations.

### State Involvement
**State Enterprises:**
- The Royal Mint (sole producer of dwarven coinage)
- The Mithril Monopoly (Crown controls all mithril trade)
- The Deep Watch (state military, not privatized)

**Regulations:**
- All craftsmen must belong to appropriate guilds
- Quality standards enforced by guild inspectors
- Prices set by guild consensus (no undercutting)
- Foreign trade requires royal license

**Trade Policy:** Exports of weapons, armor, and mithril tightly controlled. Food imports encouraged (the Holds cannot feed themselves).

**Currency:** The dwarven gold mark is the most trusted currency in the known world. Exchange rate favors the Holds.

### Wealth & Resources
**Key Resources:**
- Mithril (largest known deposits)
- Gold and silver (abundant)
- Adamantine (rare but present)
- Precious gems (diamonds, rubies, sapphires)
- Iron and copper (vast quantities)

**Major Industries:**
- Mining (foundation of all wealth)
- Metalworking (weapons, armor, tools)
- Jewelry and gem-cutting
- Engineering (mechanical devices)
- Banking (trusted throughout the continent)

**Economic Health:** The Holds are fabulously wealthy by any measure. The royal treasury alone holds over 4 million gold pieces. However, much wealth is hoarded rather than circulated, and the lost territories represented 40% of former productive capacity.

## History

### Founding
In the depths of the First Age, the Maker created Durin the Deathless and led him to the mountains. Durin delved deep, found mithril, and carved the first hall of Karak-Zul. His children spread throughout the peaks, establishing the seven Great Holds. For over a thousand years, the dwarves expanded downward, mastering the deep places until their tunnels stretched beneath the entire continent. This was the Golden Age, when dwarven craft was unmatched and dwarven armies undefeated.

### Major Eras

**The Golden Age (First Age - ~500 RS):**
The period of expansion and glory. Dwarven tunnels connected the mountains to distant lands. Trade flowed freely. The great works were constructed—bridges, forges, and halls that survive today. The Deep Roads reached their greatest extent, and the Tombs of the Ancestors were carved with magnificent care.

**The Age of Shadows (~500 RS - ~1000 RS):**
Darkness rose. The first Orc invasions began, driven upward by something worse in the depths. The dwarves fought a slow retreat, sealing tunnels, abandoning outposts. The surface world collapsed into chaos, cutting the Holds off from former allies. The dwarves survived through isolation and stubborn defense.

**The Age of Grief (~1000 RS - present):**
The modern era of loss. The Great Siege (1887 RS) killed thirty thousand, including Queen Durna and Crown Prince Thorin the Elder. The Fall of the Deep Roads (1937 RS) severed access to the Tombs and the richest mines. The deaths of the remaining princes (Korin in 1965 RS, Durin in 1982 RS) left only Princess Brunhild. The Holds endure but diminish.

### Recent History
The past century has been marked by three catastrophes:

**The Great Siege (1887 RS):** The largest Orc horde in recorded history, led by the demon Gorthak the Render, besieged Karak-Zul itself. The dwarves sent desperate pleas to [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] for reinforcements. King Aldric IV promised troops. They never came—delayed by politics, fear, and broken promises. After a year of siege, Thrain IV led a sortie that broke the horde and slew Gorthak personally, but not before thirty thousand dwarves died, including his wife and eldest son. The Holds have never forgiven Aerendor's betrayal.

**The Fall of the Deep Roads (1937 RS):** Despite a century of war, the Orcs pushed deeper. When Prince Thorin the Younger led an expedition to seal the lowest tunnels, his company was overwhelmed. The Deep Roads—and access to the Tombs of the Ancestors—were lost. The seals hold, but Thrain's son lies unburied in defiled halls.

**The Silent Years (1937 RS - present):** Fifty years of defensive stagnation. The Holds have neither advanced nor retreated, maintaining the line while strength bleeds away. Trade with the surface continues through [[Thane Borgin]]'s efforts, but morale deteriorates. The death of young Prince Durin to a stray arrow in 1982 RS pushed King Thrain from grief into obsession.

### Current Situation
The Iron Holds stand at a crossroads. King Thrain, ancient and grief-maddened, plans a massive offensive to reclaim the Deep Roads—an assault that could restore dwarven glory or destroy what remains. His sole heir, [[Princess Brunhild]], chafes at being kept from danger while others die. The Thane-Moot is divided between those who support the assault and those who counsel continued defense. Meanwhile, something stirs in the deepest tunnels, driving more Orcs upward each year. The Holds have survived three thousand years. Whether they survive the next decade depends on decisions not yet made.

## Key Figures

### Current Ruler
**Name:** [[High King Thrain IV]]
**Title:** High King Under the Mountain, Lord of All Holds
**Description:** A massive dwarf in his 350s, scarred from centuries of war, missing one eye and half an ear. His iron-gray beard is braided with gold rings marking his victories. Once called Thrain the Bold, he is now the Stone-Father—cold, unyielding, consumed by grief and vengeance. He has buried a wife and three sons; the pain has calcified into fury. He trusts no surface race, plans obsessively to reclaim the lost halls, and drives himself toward either victory or glorious death.

### Power Behind the Throne
**Name:** [[Princess Brunhild]]
**Position:** Royal Heir, de facto administrator
**Influence:** While her grandfather obsesses over military planning, Brunhild handles much daily governance. She is the only one who can sometimes redirect his rage, the only one whose counsel he occasionally accepts. Her influence grows as his focus narrows.

### Major Officials

1. **[[Thane Borgin]] (Thane of Karak-Hirn):** The King's oldest surviving friend, nearly as ancient as Thrain himself. The only dwarf who can speak to the King as an equal. Leads the trade faction and urges moderation, though his advice is increasingly ignored.

2. **General Kargan Trollslayer (Master of the Deep Watch):** Commander of all forces facing the Orc frontier. A veteran of the Great Siege, personally loyal to Thrain, fully committed to the planned offensive. If the assault launches, he will lead it.

3. **Runelord Kragg (High Priest of the Maker):** Ancient even by dwarven standards, keeper of religious tradition and interpreter of divine will. His support legitimizes Thrain's rule; his doubts could undermine it.

4. **Archivist Snorri (Keeper of the Grudges):** Maintains the Book of Grudges, the sacred record of all wrongs done to the dwarven people. His recitations of Aerendor's betrayal keep anti-human sentiment alive.

### Opposition Leader
**Name:** Thane Durak Goldbeard
**Position:** Thane of Karak-Azgal
**Goals:** Prevent the Deep Roads offensive, which he views as suicidal. Seal the lower tunnels permanently. Focus entirely on internal defense and economic survival. He does not oppose Thrain openly but works to delay and obstruct war preparations.

## Secrets

1. **The True Enemy:** The Orcs are fleeing something. Deep beneath the mountains, something ancient stirs—something that predates the dwarves. The oldest records, which few can read, speak of the "Hungering Dark" sealed beneath the roots of the world. The Orc invasions may be refugees, not invaders.

2. **The Weakening Seals:** The seals that close the Deep Roads are failing. Runelord Kragg knows but has told only the King. The choice is stark: reinforce the seals (abandoning the Tombs forever) or break through before they fail (risking whatever the Orcs flee from).

3. **The Succession Plot:** Several Thanes quietly position themselves for succession, knowing Thrain's line may end with Brunhild. Durak Goldbeard and Gotrek Gurnisson both have distant claims; both gather supporters. A succession war could shatter the Holds.

4. **The Covenant's Interest:** [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] seeks access to something beneath the mountains—possibly a seal-point, possibly knowledge of the Shackled God. They have attempted to place agents among surface traders. So far, dwarven xenophobia has protected the Holds, but the cult is patient.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Deep Roads Offensive:** The King plans his assault. He needs intelligence, allies, and possibly heroes to scout the path. Surface adventurers might be acceptable where dwarven lives are too precious to risk.

2. **The Succession Question:** With Brunhild as sole heir, factions approach her—some to protect, some to manipulate, some to eliminate. She might hire outsiders to investigate threats the dwarven bureaucracy cannot.

3. **The Ancient Evil:** Something drives the Orcs upward. Someone must discover what before the seals fail entirely. The answer may lie in records so old only non-dwarven scholars can read them.

4. **The Trade Mission:** [[Thane Borgin]] wants to negotiate with [[The River Compact]] but needs escorts who won't provoke incident. Non-dwarves might navigate human politics better than proud dwarven warriors.

5. **The Lost Prince:** Rumors persist that Prince Thorin the Younger survived the Deep Roads disaster. Some claim to have seen a scarred dwarf in the Underdark, still fighting. True or false, the rumor destabilizes the succession.
