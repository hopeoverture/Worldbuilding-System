# The Realm of the Winter King

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The "Angmar" archetype. A realm of darkness, ice, and sorcery in the north, ruled by an entity that may not be human anymore. Hostile to the southern lands.

## Overview
A shadow lies over [[The Pale North]]. The scattered tribes of snow-men live in fear of the Iron Spire where the Winter King rules. It is a land where the dead do not always stay dead, and where sorcerers practice arts forbidden in the south.

## Structure
**Ruler:** [[The Winter King]]. An ancient sorcerer or wraith who seeks to bring an eternal winter to Valdoria.
**Military:** Tribes of corrupted men, wargs, trolls, and undead.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Long Night:** The days are getting shorter, and snow is falling in [[The Westmark]] in summer.
2.  **The Raids:** Organized warbands are testing the northern defenses of [[The Kingdom of Aerendor]].

## Image Prompts
