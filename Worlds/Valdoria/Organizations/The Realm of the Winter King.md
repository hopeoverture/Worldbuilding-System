# The Realm of the Winter King

> [!info] Character Summary
> A frozen nightmare realm ruled by an immortal lich-lord who was once one of the most promising students the Arcane Synod ever produced. Expelled for pursuing forbidden necromancy nearly six centuries ago, he retreated to the frozen north and built an empire of ice, death, and dark sorcery. His realm exists in perpetual twilight, his subjects are slaves or corpses, and his ambition is nothing less than the conquest of all Valdoria under a blanket of eternal winter. The southern nations consider him a distant legend—a mistake that may doom them all.

## Overview

Where the sun barely rises and the snow never melts, the Realm of the Winter King stretches across the frozen wastes of [[The Pale North]]. From his iron citadel of [[Carn Dum]], the lich-lord who calls himself the Winter King rules over a population of subjugated tribes, corrupted sorcerers, and countless undead. For nearly six centuries he has grown in power, gathering armies of the dead, binding frost giants and ice devils to his will, and extending the reach of his eternal winter ever southward. The southern kingdoms dismiss him as a regional problem, a bogeyman for frightening children. They do not understand that he remembers when the Aerendor Empire was young, that he has studied magics they cannot comprehend, and that he is patient—patient as only the deathless can be. When the Long Night comes, they will learn.

## Classification

### Government Type
**Type:** Magocracy / Tyranny

**Subtype:** Absolute Magical Dictatorship. The Winter King's word is law, and his Sorcerer-Lords enforce his will through magical power rather than any pretense of administrative structure.

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Conquest and Magical Supremacy. The Winter King rules because no one can challenge him. His power is self-evident—the weather itself obeys him.

**Public Perception:** Feared and Obeyed. Among the living population, there is no question of legitimacy—only survival. Those who serve are permitted to live. Those who resist become part of his undead legions.

## Territory

### Extent
The Realm of the Winter King encompasses:
- **Core Territories:** The Pale North, including the Frozen Wastes, the Bitter Peaks, and the shores of the Ice-Choked Sea
- **Vassal States:** Several tribes of northern humans and frost giants technically rule themselves but pay tribute and provide soldiers on demand
- **Contested Zones:** The southern marches, where the Winter King's influence extends further each year—villages that once saw summer now endure year-round snow
- **Expansion Targets:** [[The Sundered Peaks]] and [[The Westmark]]—the King covets the dwarven forges and the human farmlands

### Borders
- **Natural Boundaries:** The Ice-Choked Sea to the north, the Bitter Peaks to the east
- **Fortified Borders:** A line of ice-fortresses along the southern edge, garrisoned by undead that never sleep
- **Border Disputes:** Constant raiding into [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] territory; occasional conflicts with frost giant clans that refuse vassalage
- **Relations with Neighbors:** All living nations are enemies to be conquered. [[The Iron Holds]] represent a particular obstacle—dwarves are resistant to cold and difficult to raise as undead.

### Capital
**Name:** [[Carn Dum]], the Citadel of Iron and Ice

**Description:** A massive fortress of black iron and frozen stone, rising from the heart of a dead glacier. Its towers reach toward the perpetually dark sky like grasping claws, and witch-light of sickly green burns in every window. The fortress is said to extend as far below the ice as above it, containing laboratories, treasuries, and prisons where the King conducts experiments too terrible to contemplate. No living mortal has entered Carn Dum and returned unchanged—if they returned at all.

**Why Located Here:** Built on the ruins of an ancient pre-human civilization, Carn Dum sits atop a confluence of ley lines that amplifies magical power. The Winter King chose this site specifically for its magical potential and its defensive remoteness.

### Major Regions
1. **The Frozen Wastes:** The central tundra, dotted with ice-tombs and the encampments of subjugated tribes. Population: ~50,000 living, unknown undead.
2. **The Bitter Peaks:** Mountain range home to frost giants, ice trolls, and dragon-kin. Several peaks contain Sorcerer-Lord domains.
3. **The Dead Marches:** Southern border region, a perpetual battlefield where undead armies probe southern defenses. Living populations have fled; only the dead remain.
4. **The Frost Fens:** Western marshlands that never fully freeze, home to corrupted creatures and swamp-dwelling tribes who worship the Winter King as a god.

## Structure of Power

### Head of State
**Title:** The Winter King, Lord of the Frozen Throne, Master of the Long Night

**Current Holder:** [[The Winter King]]—the immortal lich-lord who has ruled since the realm's founding

**Selection Method:** Conquest and magical supremacy. There is no succession because the Winter King does not intend to die.

**Term:** Eternal

**Powers:** Absolute. The Winter King controls the weather within his domain, commands all undead, and can see through the eyes of any corpse within his territory. His word creates law, his displeasure means death (followed by eternal servitude).

### Ruling Body
**Name:** The Council of Sorcerer-Lords

**Composition:** Seven powerful sorcerers, each granted a domain within the realm in exchange for eternal loyalty. All are bound to the Winter King through magical compacts that prevent betrayal—or so the King believes.

**Powers:** Governance of their territories, command of local forces, research into new magical weapons. They advise the King but do not constrain him.

**How Members Selected:** Personally chosen by the Winter King from among ambitious sorcerers who prove their power and loyalty. Several are former Synod mages who fled prosecution.

### Key Offices

| Office | Holder | Responsibilities |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Lord of the Dead Marches | Sorcerer-Lord Vrath | Commands southern military operations |
| Keeper of the Tombs | Sorcerer-Lord Meridia | Maintains the vast undead armies |
| Master of Whispers | Sorcerer-Lord Kael | Spy network and intelligence |
| Warden of the Giants | Sorcerer-Lord Thun | Liaison with frost giant vassals |
| The Pale Surgeon | Sorcerer-Lord Nyx | Experiments on living subjects; creates new horrors |
| Lord of Storms | Sorcerer-Lord Boreas | Weather manipulation; extends the winter |
| The Shadow Voice | Sorcerer-Lord Silith | Cult activities in southern lands |

### Succession
There is no succession. The Winter King is immortal and intends to rule forever. However:
- **If destroyed:** The Sorcerer-Lords would likely tear each other apart fighting for supremacy
- **Contingencies:** The King has created phylacteries (locations unknown even to his Lords) ensuring his eventual return
- **Real danger:** Not death, but betrayal. At least two Sorcerer-Lords plot against him.

## Administration

### Bureaucracy
The realm has no bureaucracy in the traditional sense:
- **Size:** Non-existent. Governance is through magical enforcement.
- **Key Functions:** Handled by Sorcerer-Lords and their personal servants
- **Corruption:** Irrelevant—there is only obedience or death
- **Record Keeping:** The Winter King remembers everything. Literally.

### Taxation
**Types of Tribute:**
- Living subjects provide food, labor, and children (for experiments or sacrifice)
- Frost giant vassals provide warriors and craft goods
- Sorcerer-Lords provide magical research and artifacts

**Collection Method:** Undead collectors arrive at villages quarterly. Failure to meet quotas means some villagers don't leave with them.

**Burden:** Crushing. Life in the realm is short, harsh, and ends in service.

### Law & Justice
**Law Code:** The King's will

**Courts:** None. Disputes are settled by local power structures. Crimes against the King or his Lords mean immediate death and resurrection as a mindless servant.

**Punishments:**
- Minor offenses: Torture, forced labor
- Major offenses: Death and undead servitude
- Treason: Conscious eternal torment

**Rights:** None. All subjects are property.

### Military
**Standing Army:**
- Living: ~15,000 (corrupted humans, frost giant auxiliaries, monster warbands)
- Undead: ~50,000+ (and growing)
- Constructs: ~500 (ice golems, animated armor)

**Command Structure:** Sorcerer-Lords command regional forces; the Winter King personally commands during major campaigns

**Special Units:**
- The Frozen Guard (elite undead warriors in enchanted armor)
- The Windriders (sorcerers on undead dragons)
- The Pale Hounds (transformed lycanthropes bound to the King's will)

## Politics

### Factions
1. **The Loyalists:** Sorcerer-Lords who genuinely believe in the Winter King's vision of eternal conquest. Leader: Sorcerer-Lord Vrath
2. **The Ambitious:** Those who serve while planning eventual betrayal. Leader: Sorcerer-Lord Nyx (secretly)
3. **The True Believers:** Living subjects who worship the Winter King as a god, seeking favor through zealous service. Many serve as priests spreading his cult southward.
4. **The Survivors:** The bulk of the living population, who serve only because the alternative is worse than death.

### Current Issues
1. **The First Seal:** The Winter King has learned of [[The Shackled God]] and the seals. He views the Covenant's work with interest—chaos in the south serves his purposes.
2. **The Long Night:** Preparations for a major offensive southward are underway. The King believes the time is approaching.
3. **Internal Plotting:** Sorcerer-Lord Nyx has been communicating with outside powers. The King suspects but hasn't acted yet.

### Foreign Policy
**Approach:** All living nations are future conquests. There is no diplomacy, only varying degrees of hostility.

**Relationships:**
- **[[Kingdom of Aerendor]]:** Primary target. The King despises this realm as the Synod's patron.
- **[[The Iron Holds]]:** Obstacle to be overcome. The dwarves are resistant to his powers.
- **[[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]:** Useful idiots. The King allows Covenant agents to operate, as their chaos benefits him.
- **[[The Arcane Synod]]:** Personal vendetta. The King will see Thalassar frozen and its mages enslaved.

## Society

### Governed Population
**Population Size:** ~100,000 living (declining), 50,000+ undead (growing)

**Demographics:**
- Northern human tribes (majority of living)
- Frost giants (vassals, ~3,000)
- Corrupted humans serving as soldiers and sorcerers
- Various monster populations (trolls, wargs, winter wolves)

**Social Classes:**
- Sorcerer-Lords (ruling elite)
- Sorcerers and priests (privileged servants)
- Warriors (valued while alive)
- Common folk (expendable labor)
- Undead (eternal servants)

**Minorities:** Any who flee here from the south seeking power are welcomed—and eventually enslaved or transformed.

### Rights & Freedoms
**Legal Protections:** None

**Restrictions:** All freedoms are subject to the will of the local Sorcerer-Lord. Travel requires permission. Gathering in groups is forbidden. Magic use by non-authorized persons means death.

**Religious Freedom:** Only worship of the Winter King is permitted. Other faiths are destroyed.

### Public Services
**Infrastructure:** Ice roads maintained by undead labor connecting settlements

**Security:** Undead patrols. No crime—because there's nothing to steal and no law to break.

**Welfare:** None. Survive or serve.

**Education:** Only for those chosen as potential sorcerers. Knowledge is restricted.

## Economy

### Economic System
**Type:** State-Controlled Extraction

### State Involvement
The economy exists only to serve the realm's military needs:
- **State Enterprises:** All production is state-controlled
- **Regulations:** Complete control of all resources
- **Trade Policy:** No formal trade; occasional raids south bring needed materials
- **Currency:** Barter among the living; undead need nothing

### Wealth & Resources
**Key Resources:**
- Ice crystal (magical component)
- Adamantine from the Bitter Peaks
- Living bodies (converted to undead workers/soldiers)
- Souls (for the darkest rituals)

**Major Industries:**
- Weapon forging (cold-iron and enchanted)
- Undead creation
- Monster breeding

**Economic Health:** Self-sustaining through magic and undead labor, but dependent on expansion for living resources.

## History

### Founding
In approximately 1420 RS, a brilliant young sorcerer named Malachar of House Veyren was expelled from [[The Arcane Synod]] for pursuing forbidden necromantic research. Rather than submit to the Synod's justice, he fled north with his research, his followers, and his burning resentment. In the frozen wastes, he found the ruins of Carn Dum and the dark power sleeping beneath it. Over decades, he perfected his art, shed his mortality, and declared himself the Winter King. The realm that bears his title has grown ever since.

### Major Eras
**The Founding Years (1420-1500 RS):**
Malachar established his power base, subjugated the northern tribes, and transformed himself into a lich. The Synod sent two expeditions to destroy him; neither returned.

**The Consolidation (1500-1800 RS):**
The Winter King focused inward, building Carn Dum, creating his Sorcerer-Lords, and perfecting his weather-manipulation magic. The south forgot about him, dismissing early reports as exaggeration.

**The Long Patience (1800-Present):**
A period of quiet preparation. The King has been building his forces, extending his influence through cults and spies, and waiting for the right moment. That moment approaches.

### Recent History
Over the past fifty years, the Winter King has become more active:
- Raiding parties probe southern defenses with increasing frequency
- The winters in northern Aerendor have grown longer and harsher
- His cult has spread to desperate communities throughout Valdoria
- Several powerful sorcerers have defected to his realm

### Current Situation
The Realm of the Winter King stands poised for major action. The First Seal weakens, drawing attention south. [[King Eldred II]]'s paranoia has left border defenses neglected. [[High King Thrain IV]] is focused on the orcs below, not the threat above. The Winter King believes his time has come. The Long Night—a magical offensive that would extend his eternal winter across all of Valdoria—is nearly ready. All he needs is the right moment to strike.

## Key Figures

### Current Ruler
**Name:** [[The Winter King]] (born Malachar of House Veyren)

**Title:** The Winter King, Lord of the Frozen Throne, Master of the Long Night

**Description:** What remains of Malachar is barely recognizable as something once human. He appears as a towering figure in robes of frozen shadow, his face a skull of ice that glows with blue witch-light. His voice is the wind across frozen graves, and his presence drops temperatures below freezing. Yet behind the horror is a brilliant, patient, utterly ruthless intellect that has been planning conquest for six centuries. He remembers every slight the Synod ever dealt him, and he intends to repay them a thousandfold.

### Power Behind the Throne
**Name:** None—the Winter King shares power with no one

**However:** Sorcerer-Lord Nyx has been accumulating influence secretly, positioning herself to either succeed the King or bargain with outside powers for her own survival.

### Major Officials
1. **Sorcerer-Lord Vrath:** The most loyal and the most powerful of the Lords. Commands the Dead Marches and leads major military operations. A former [[Grey Wardens]] officer corrupted by promises of power.
2. **Sorcerer-Lord Meridia:** Keeper of the Tombs, the greatest necromancer besides the King himself. Manages the vast undead infrastructure.
3. **Sorcerer-Lord Silith:** The Shadow Voice, who runs cult operations in the south. Has been active in [[Rivergard]] and [[Lond Daer]] for decades.
4. **The Ice Queen:** A frost giant jarl who leads the giant auxiliaries. Bound by ancient pacts, she serves loyally but dreams of freedom.

### Opposition Leader
**Name:** Eira of the Free Clans

**Position:** Leader of a coalition of escaped slaves and free northerners hiding in the Bitter Peaks

**Goals:** Survival first, resistance second. Dreams of assassinating the Winter King but lacks the means. Seeks contact with southern powers for aid.

## Secrets

1. **The King's Phylactery:** The Winter King has created multiple phylacteries—one is hidden beneath [[Carn Dum]], another in the Bitter Peaks, and a third... in the vaults beneath [[The Arcane Synod]]. Even if destroyed, he will return.

2. **The Shackled God Connection:** The Winter King has been in contact with [[The Prophet of Chains]]. He has no interest in freeing the Shackled God but sees the Covenant's work as useful chaos. He secretly plans to seize control of any power released when the seals break.

3. **Nyx's Betrayal:** Sorcerer-Lord Nyx has been communicating with [[The Arcane Synod]], offering to betray the King in exchange for amnesty and power. The Synod hasn't responded—yet.

4. **The Sleeping Army:** Beneath the ice of the Frozen Wastes lies an army from the Age of Myth—thousands of warriors in magical stasis. The Winter King has nearly solved the puzzle of awakening them.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Winter Wolves:** Dire wolves corrupted by the King's power have been seen south of the mountains. They're scouting for the coming invasion.

2. **The Frozen Village:** An entire village in [[The Westmark]] was found frozen solid overnight—every man, woman, and child. The Winter King is testing a new weapon.

3. **The Defector:** A Sorcerer-Lord's apprentice has fled south with vital intelligence about the Long Night ritual. Half the realm is hunting him.

4. **The Free Clans:** Eira's resistance has made contact with [[The Grey Wardens]], seeking alliance. They offer information about Carn Dum's defenses—but can they be trusted?

5. **The Phylactery Hunt:** A dying Synod sage reveals the King's secret—one of his phylacteries is beneath their own citadel. Someone must destroy it before the King learns they know.
