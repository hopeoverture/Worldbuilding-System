# The Riddle-Mark

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> Represents the "Horse Lords" archetype. Proud, fierce, and independent. They control the vast plains and are the finest cavalry in Valdoria. Tone is heroic but rustic.

## Overview
The Riddle-Mark is a confederation of horse-clans that roam the vast expanse of [[The Greenfields]]. While they acknowledge a High Chief, usually from the strongest clan, each tribe is largely autonomous. They are fiercely protective of their herds and their freedom, viewing the stone cities of [[The Westmark]] as cages.

## Classification

### Government Type
**Type:** Tribal Monarchy / Confederation

**Subtype:** Meritocratic (The Strongest Rules)

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Strength of Arms / Tradition.
**Public Perception:** Respected by their own; feared by neighbors as "barbarians."

## Territory

### Extent
- **Core Territories:** The central plains of [[The Greenfields]].
- **Disputed:** The borders with [[The Ashlands]] (constant raids) and [[The Eastern Frontier]].

### Capital
**Name:** [[Stedding-feld]]
**Description:** A great wooden hall atop a defensible hill, surrounded by a palisade. It is more a meeting place than a permanent city.
**Why Located Here:** Central location, good grazing, defensible.

## Structure of Power

### Head of State
**Title:** High Chief (or King of the Grass)
**Current Holder:** [[High Chief Eomeric]]
**Selection Method:** Elected by the Council of Mares (Clan Chiefs) upon death of previous chief, usually from the royal bloodline but must prove strength.

### Ruling Body
**Name:** The Council of Mares
**Composition:** The chiefs of the 12 major clans.

## Administration
**Bureaucracy:** Minimal. Oral tradition and honor codes replace written law.
**Taxation:** Tribute in horses and cattle.

## Military
**Standing Army:** The High Chief's Hearthguard (3,000 elite riders).
**Wartime:** The "Mustering of the Mark" can call 20,000 riders in a week.
**Strength:** Unmatched cavalry; weak in sieges.

## Politics
**Factions:**
1.  **The Traditionalists:** Want to remain nomadic and isolated.
2.  **The Settlers:** Want to build stone towns and trade with [[The River Compact]].
3.  **The War Party:** Want to preemptively strike [[The Ashlands]].

## Society
**Values:** Horses, Honor, Freedom, Song.
**Demographics:** Mostly Human, some Halflings (who act as scouts/cooks/logistics).

## History
**Founding:** The tribes migrated south centuries ago to escape the "Winter King" in the north.
**Recent History:** United under Eomeric to repel an Orc invasion from the mountains.

## Key Figures
**Current Ruler:** [[High Chief Eomeric]]. A warrior-poet who sings as well as he fights.
**Rival:** [[Warlord Hrothgar]], chief of a rival clan who thinks Eomeric is too soft on the "Stone-Men."

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Stolen Stallion:** The Chief's prize warhorse has been stolen, possibly by a rival clan or dark magic.
2.  **The Ash Raids:** Orcs are burning the eastern grazing lands; the Mark needs allies.
