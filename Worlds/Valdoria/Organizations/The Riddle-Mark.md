# The Riddle-Mark

> [!info] Character Summary
> A proud confederation of horse-clans that controls the vast sea of grass known as [[The Greenfields]]. The finest cavalry in Valdoria, they live by an ancient code of honor, freedom, and kinship that the "stone-dwellers" of the cities can never understand. Their ancestors fled south nine centuries ago to escape the Winter King's growing shadow, and they have held these plains ever since through courage, horsemanship, and an unbreakable warrior spirit. They are the shield of the south, whether the soft city-folk appreciate it or not.

## Overview

Across the endless grasslands of [[The Greenfields]], the riders of the Riddle-Mark are born in the saddle and die in the saddle—and they wouldn't have it any other way. Twelve great clans acknowledge the authority of the High Chief at [[Stedding-feld]], though each clan is largely autonomous in its own territory. They are a people who measure wealth in horses, settle disputes through single combat, and preserve their history through epic songs rather than dusty scrolls. The kingdoms of [[The Westmark]] view them as uncouth barbarians; the orcs of [[The Ashlands]] have learned to fear their thundering charges. When the Riddle-Mark rides to war, twenty thousand cavalry sweep across the plains like a flood of steel and horseflesh—a sight that has broken armies and turned the tide of battles throughout Valdoria's history.

## Classification

### Government Type
**Type:** Tribal Monarchy / Confederation

**Subtype:** Meritocratic Elective. The High Chief is chosen by the Council of Mares from the royal bloodline, but candidates must prove their worth through tests of combat, horsemanship, and wisdom. Weak or incompetent rulers have been passed over for more distant relatives who demonstrated strength.

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Tradition, Proven Strength, and Divine Mandate. The First Rider, ancestor of the royal line, reportedly received blessing from Epona, the Horse-Mother, to lead the tribes south to safety.

**Public Perception:** Deeply respected by the clans, who see the High Chief as first among equals—a war leader and arbiter, not a tyrant. Neighboring kingdoms often fail to understand that the High Chief cannot simply command obedience like a king.

## Territory

### Extent
The Riddle-Mark's territory encompasses:
- **Core Territories:** The central and western [[Greenfields]], including the best grazing lands and the sacred sites of the clans
- **Eastern Marches:** Contested borderlands with [[The Ashlands]], scene of constant raiding and counter-raiding
- **Northern Reaches:** The foothills below [[The Sundered Peaks]], where some clans graze in summer
- **Southern Claims:** The plains that border [[The River Compact]], where settled farmers pay tribute to ride through clan lands

### Borders
- **Natural Boundaries:** The [[Sundered Peaks]] to the north, [[The Ashlands]] to the east, the [[Mirewood]] to the southwest
- **Fortified Borders:** A chain of wooden watchtowers along the eastern frontier, each within sight of the next
- **Border Disputes:** Constant low-intensity conflict with orc raiders from the Ashlands; occasional tension with River Compact farmers who push too far north; complex relations with the dwarves of the Sundered Peaks
- **Relations with Neighbors:** Allied with [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] through ancient oaths; suspicious of [[The River Compact]]'s mercantile culture; at perpetual war with the orcs

### Capital
**Name:** [[Stedding-feld]], the Hall of the High Chief

**Description:** Rising from a defensible hilltop in the heart of the Greenfields, Stedding-feld is less a city than a permanent camp writ large. The Great Hall—a vast wooden structure with golden thatch and horse-head carvings—dominates the summit. Around it cluster the lesser halls of the royal clan and the traditional quarters where visiting chiefs stay. A wooden palisade surrounds the hilltop, and below spreads a sprawling tent-city that swells during the great gatherings. The population of ~5,000 permanent residents can triple when all clans assemble.

**Why Located Here:** The First Rider chose this hill where the grass never fails and enemies can be seen coming for miles. It sits at the crossroads of the major clan territories, making it the natural gathering place.

### Major Regions
1. **The Royal Grasslands:** Territory of the High Chief's clan, surrounding Stedding-feld. Population: ~60,000
2. **The Eastern March:** Contested borderlands with the Ashlands, held by the warlike Burning Spear and Black Arrow clans. Population: ~50,000
3. **The Green Heart:** Central plains where the richest clans graze their herds. Home to the Golden Horse and Silver Mane clans. Population: ~120,000
4. **The Northern Reaches:** Foothills territory, rougher terrain suited to hardy folk. Home to the Mountain Hoof and Storm Riders. Population: ~80,000
5. **The Southern Plains:** Border region with the River Compact, home to the more settled Wheat Spear and River Watch clans. Population: ~90,000

## Structure of Power

### Head of State
**Title:** High Chief of the Riddle-Mark, King of the Grass, Lord of the First Herd

**Current Holder:** [[High Chief Eomeric]], of the Golden Horse Clan (ruling clan)

**Selection Method:** Upon the death or abdication of a High Chief, the Council of Mares gathers at Stedding-feld. Candidates from the royal bloodline (the Golden Horse Clan and its cadet branches) may present themselves. Each must complete the Three Trials: the Race of the Wind (horsemanship), the Test of Steel (combat), and the Riddle of the Wise (judgment). The Council then votes, with each clan chief having one voice. Tradition favors the most proven candidate, not necessarily the closest heir.

**Term:** Life, or until incapacitation. A High Chief too old or wounded to ride may voluntarily surrender the position.

**Powers:**
- Commands the loyalty of all clan warriors in time of war
- Serves as supreme judge in disputes between clans
- Negotiates with foreign powers on behalf of the Mark
- May call the Mustering of the Mark (full mobilization)
- Cannot dictate to individual clans in internal matters

### Ruling Body
**Name:** The Council of Mares

**Composition:** The chiefs of the Twelve Clans, plus the High Chief. Traditionally, each clan is represented by its oldest living patriarch or matriarch who can still sit a horse.

**Powers:**
- Elects the High Chief
- Must approve major treaties and alliances
- Can censure or (in extreme cases) depose a High Chief
- Settles disputes that individual chiefs cannot resolve
- Decides on matters of tribal law and custom

**How Members Selected:** Each clan chooses its own chief according to its traditions—some hereditary, some by combat, some by elder council.

### The Twelve Clans

| Clan | Territory | Chief | Reputation |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Golden Horse | Royal Grasslands | High Chief Eomeric | The ruling clan, wise and ancient |
| Burning Spear | Eastern March | Warlord Hrothgar | Warlike, aggressive, chafes at peace |
| Black Arrow | Eastern March | Lady Sylfra | Best archers in the Mark |
| Silver Mane | Green Heart | Chief Aldric the Old | Wealthy, traditional, conservative |
| Thunderhoof | Green Heart | Chief Bran Iron-Voice | Largest herds, political weight |
| Mountain Hoof | Northern Reaches | Chief Dunstan | Hardy, proud, somewhat isolated |
| Storm Riders | Northern Reaches | Chieftess Mira | Known for their mounted archery |
| Wheat Spear | Southern Plains | Chief Godwin | Most settled, build permanent homes |
| River Watch | Southern Plains | Chief Alaric | Trade with River Compact, unpopular |
| Red Dawn | Central Plains | Chieftess Eira | Small but fierce, excellent scouts |
| Iron Stirrup | Various | Chief Kort | Smiths and crafters, dispersed |
| Night Riders | Various | Chief Shadow-son | Mysterious, rumored to ride under moonlight |

### Key Offices

| Office | Holder | Responsibilities |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Marshal of the Mark | Warlord Hrothgar (contested) | Wartime military commander under the Chief |
| Keeper of the Herd-Count | Elder Morwen | Tracks wealth and tribute |
| Song-Master | Bard Gwydion | Preserves history, law, and tradition |
| Master of the Eastern Watch | Lady Sylfra | Defends against orc incursions |
| Voice to the Stone-Men | Chief Alaric | Diplomacy with foreign kingdoms |

### Succession
The current succession is potentially troubled:
- Eomeric has two sons: Eothain (capable but cautious) and Elfhelm (bold but reckless)
- Warlord Hrothgar believes his victories entitle him to challenge for the position
- Some whisper that Chieftess Mira of the Storm Riders could be the first woman to claim the title
- The Night Riders' Chief Shadow-son has made no claim but represents a wild card

## Administration

### Bureaucracy
The Riddle-Mark has almost no formal bureaucracy:
- **Size:** Perhaps two dozen scribes and record-keepers at Stedding-feld
- **Key Functions:** Tracking tribute, maintaining message-riders between clans
- **Corruption Level:** Low—there's little to corrupt when government is minimal
- **Record Keeping:** Primarily oral. The Song-Master and clan bards preserve law, history, and agreements in epic verse

### Taxation
**Tribute System:**
- Clans provide tribute to the High Chief in horses, cattle, leather goods, and warriors
- Settled farmers within clan territories pay in grain and labor
- Merchants crossing clan lands pay passage fees
- In times of war, special levies may be called

**Collection Method:** Each clan collects from its own people and sends tribute to Stedding-feld during the great gatherings

**Burden:** Light by settled kingdom standards. Freedom from heavy taxation is a point of pride.

### Law & Justice
**Law Code:** The Riddle-Law, an oral tradition of customs, precedents, and sacred prohibitions passed down through the Song-Masters

**Courts:**
- Disputes within a clan: settled by the clan chief
- Disputes between clans: brought to the Council of Mares
- Serious crimes against guests, women, or horses: tried by the High Chief himself

**Punishments:**
- Minor offenses: Fines in horses
- Serious offenses: Temporary exile, brand-marking
- Unforgivable crimes: Permanent exile (effectively death), or execution by trampling

**Rights of Hospitality:** Sacred. A guest under your roof is protected by your honor. Violating hospitality is among the worst crimes.

### Military
**Standing Force:** The High Chief's Hearthguard—3,000 elite mounted warriors permanently stationed at Stedding-feld

**Clan Warbands:** Each clan maintains warriors who train regularly; combined, perhaps 15,000 experienced riders

**The Mustering:** In times of emergency, the High Chief can call the Mustering of the Mark. Every man and woman who can ride and hold a spear answers—up to 25,000 cavalry within a fortnight

**Strengths:**
- Unmatched cavalry mobility and shock tactics
- Can appear anywhere on the plains within days
- Excellent scouts and horse archers
- Fight with terrifying courage and coordination

**Weaknesses:**
- Poor at siege warfare
- Light armor vulnerable to heavy infantry
- Supply lines depend on living off the land
- Clan rivalries can fracture unified command

## Politics

### Factions
1. **The Traditionalists:** Led by Silver Mane Chief Aldric, they want to preserve the old ways—remain nomadic, reject stone buildings, maintain distance from the "soft" kingdoms. Strength: Strong among older chiefs and rural clans.

2. **The Settlers:** Led by Wheat Spear Chief Godwin, they advocate for more permanent settlements, written laws, and closer ties with the River Compact. Strength: Growing among southern clans seeing trade benefits.

3. **The War Party:** Led by Warlord Hrothgar, they demand aggressive action against the Ashland orcs, viewing recent raids as intolerable insults. Some want preemptive war; others want to push east and claim orc lands. Strength: Popular among young warriors.

4. **The Isolationists:** A loose coalition who distrust all outsiders equally. They remember that Aerendor failed to aid the Mark during the last great orc invasion. Strength: Moderate but influential among elder councils.

### Current Issues
1. **The Marshal Question:** Hrothgar expects to be named Marshal of the Mark, but Eomeric hesitates, fearing Hrothgar will start an unnecessary war. The delay is causing a rift.

2. **The Orc Resurgence:** Raids from the Ashlands have intensified. Something is driving the orcs westward in greater numbers—possibly pressure from the Covenant's activities or events in the Sundered Peaks.

3. **The Trade Debate:** The River Compact offers lucrative trade agreements that would benefit the southern clans but require permanent trading posts and concessions some see as the first step toward subjugation.

4. **The Succession:** Eomeric is fifty-three—still vital, but the question of his successor grows more pressing. His sons are both flawed candidates, and Hrothgar waits.

### Foreign Policy
**Approach:** Proudly independent but willing to honor old alliances when it serves the Mark

**Relationships:**
- **[[Kingdom of Aerendor]]:** Bound by the Oath of Eorl (ancient alliance). Aerendor failed to honor it during the last orc invasion, creating lasting resentment, but the oath remains technically in force.
- **[[The Iron Holds]]:** Respectful distance. The Riders trade horses for dwarven steel but find the dwarves "too attached to stone."
- **[[The River Compact]]:** Complicated. Trade benefits both, but the Riders distrust merchant culture. [[Grand Mayor Lysandra]] has been courting closer ties.
- **[[The Ashlands]]:** Perpetual war. The orcs are the eternal enemy.
- **[[The Realm of the Winter King]]:** Ancient memory. The tribes fled his shadow nine centuries ago. The Riders remember.

## Society

### Governed Population
**Population Size:** ~400,000

**Demographics:**
- Humans (vast majority, ~350,000)
- Halflings (~30,000) - valued as scouts, cooks, and craftspeople
- Half-elves (~5,000) - particularly in clans near the Mirewood
- Others (~15,000) - scattered individuals and small groups

**Social Classes:**
- **Thanes:** Clan chiefs and their immediate families
- **Warriors:** Proven riders who have earned their place
- **Herders:** The backbone of society, tending flocks and herds
- **Craftspeople:** Smiths, leather-workers, weavers (often dispersed among clans)
- **Settled Folk:** Farmers in permanent villages, lowest status among the Riders
- **Thralls:** Rare; some captives serve until ransomed or until they earn freedom

### Rights & Freedoms
**Legal Protections:**
- Right to bear arms
- Right to trial before peers
- Right of women to own property and fight
- Right to challenge unjust rulings through combat

**Restrictions:**
- Thralls have few rights until freed
- Oathbreakers lose all protection of law
- Harming a horse carries penalties almost as severe as harming a person

**Gender Equality:** More egalitarian than most kingdoms. Women ride, fight, and can lead clans. Chieftess Mira commands the Storm Riders with universal respect.

### Public Services
**Infrastructure:**
- A network of trail-markers and supply caches across the plains
- The Eastern Watchtowers warning system
- Message-rider routes connecting clan territories

**Security:** Clan warriors patrol their own lands; the Eastern March has dedicated border patrols

**Welfare:** Clans care for their own. The poor are absorbed; orphans are fostered. No one starves while the clan has food.

**Education:** Oral tradition. Children learn to ride before they walk, learn history through songs, learn combat through constant practice.

## Economy

### Economic System
**Type:** Pastoral Nomadism with limited settled agriculture in the south

### State Involvement
The government has minimal economic role:
- **State Enterprises:** The High Chief maintains the royal herds (a symbol of prestige)
- **Regulations:** Few; honor and custom regulate most transactions
- **Trade Policy:** Foreign merchants may trade at designated sites; crossing clan land requires permission
- **Currency:** The Mark has no coinage. Wealth is measured in horses, cattle, and goods. Foreign coins accepted for trade.

### Wealth & Resources
**Key Resources:**
- Horses (the finest in Valdoria)
- Cattle, sheep, goats
- Leather goods and wool
- Grain from southern settlements
- Medicinal herbs from the plains

**Major Industries:**
- Horse breeding (legendary quality)
- Leatherworking
- Wool production
- Limited farming in the south

**Trade Goods:**
- Export: Warhorses, leather, wool, plains herbs
- Import: Metal goods, weapons, wine, luxury items

**Economic Health:** Self-sufficient in basic needs. Wealth in horses rather than coin. Resistant to economic manipulation by foreign powers.

## History

### Founding
The Riddle-Mark was born from exodus. Around 1100 RS, as the sorcerer Malachar consolidated power in the frozen north and declared himself the Winter King, the horse-tribes of the northern plains faced a choice: kneel or flee. Led by Eorl the Young, the greatest rider of his generation, the tribes chose flight. For three years they rode south, fighting through orc-lands and mountain passes, until they reached the empty grasslands they named the Greenfields. Eorl made a pact with the King of Aerendor—the Oath of Eorl—promising the Riders' swords in exchange for recognition of their claim to the plains. That oath has bound both peoples for nearly nine centuries.

### Major Eras
**The Founding Years (1100-1200 RS):**
The tribes settled the Greenfields, driving out scattered orc bands and establishing the clan territories. Eorl ruled until his death in 1156 RS; his descendants have held the high chieftainship since.

**The Wars of Consolidation (1200-1500 RS):**
Conflicts with Aerendor over borders, wars with the Ashland orcs, and internal clan warfare gradually defined the modern Mark. The Council of Mares formalized during this period.

**The Great Betrayal (1887 RS):**
When the largest orc horde in centuries swept out of the Ashlands, the Riddle-Mark sent to Aerendor for aid under the Oath of Eorl. King Aldric IV was distracted by the same political failures that led to the Dwarven Great Siege. Aid never came. High Chief Eomund III died holding the eastern passes alone. His son Eomeric united the clans and broke the horde without foreign help. The Riders have not forgotten.

### Recent History
Under Eomeric's fifty-year rule, the Riddle-Mark has enjoyed relative peace:
- The clans are united but increasingly restless
- Young warriors have had little chance to prove themselves
- The orc raids are increasing, and some see opportunity
- Trade with the River Compact brings wealth but cultural tension
- The old songs about the Winter King are being sung again as winters grow longer

### Current Situation
High Chief Eomeric holds the Mark together through personal prestige and political skill, but the pressures are mounting. Warlord Hrothgar demands war with the orcs; the southern chiefs want closer trade ties; the traditionalists fear losing their identity. The increasing orc activity suggests something is stirring in the east—whether natural migration, Covenant manipulation, or pressure from the Covenant's activities. Eomeric must decide whether to risk war or watch his people's unity fracture. And in the back of every elder's mind, the Long Night approaches—they remember why their ancestors fled south, and they see the winters growing colder.

## Key Figures

### Current Ruler
**Name:** [[High Chief Eomeric]]

**Title:** High Chief of the Riddle-Mark, King of the Grass

**Description:** At fifty-three, Eomeric remains the finest rider and one of the deadliest warriors in the Mark. Tall and lean with a grey-streaked golden beard, he sits his horse as if born there—which he essentially was. But Eomeric is also a poet and diplomat, able to calm feuding chiefs with a well-chosen word or a verse from the old songs. He bears the weight of the Great Betrayal—it was his father who died unaided—and the memory has made him cautious about foreign alliances. He loves his people and his land with fierce devotion, and he knows the decisions before him may determine whether the Riddle-Mark survives the century.

### Power Behind the Throne
**Name:** Elder Morwen, Keeper of the Herd-Count

**Position:** Official keeper of tribute records; unofficial advisor to three High Chiefs

**Influence:** Morwen, now in her eighties but still sharp as a broken sword, has been advising rulers since Eomeric's grandfather. She knows where every alliance is weak, where every chief is vulnerable, and where the bodies are buried. Eomeric trusts her counsel above all others.

### Major Officials
1. **Warlord Hrothgar (Burning Spear Clan):** The most dangerous man in the Mark. A brilliant cavalry commander who has won a dozen battles against the orcs. Believes Eomeric is too cautious. Wants the Marshalship—and perhaps the throne.

2. **Lady Sylfra (Black Arrow Clan):** Commander of the Eastern Watch. Cold, competent, and utterly dedicated to defending the border. Respects Eomeric but grows frustrated with political delay.

3. **Bard Gwydion (Song-Master):** Keeper of the oral traditions. His word on law and precedent carries immense weight. Elderly but still performs the great sagas.

4. **Chief Godwin (Wheat Spear Clan):** Leader of the settler faction. Genuinely believes permanent settlements and trade will benefit everyone. Unpopular with traditionalists.

### Opposition Leader
**Name:** Warlord Hrothgar

**Position:** Chief of the Burning Spear Clan, greatest war-leader of his generation

**Goals:** Hrothgar wants glory, victory, and recognition. He believes Eomeric's caution dishonors the warriors who died fighting orcs. He wants the Marshalship immediately, a war of conquest against the Ashlands eventually, and is not-so-secretly positioning himself as a potential High Chief.

## Secrets

1. **The Broken Oath:** Eomeric sent a secret envoy to Aerendor last year to formally renounce the Oath of Eorl. [[King Eldred II]]'s paranoia led him to imprison the envoy as a suspected spy. Eomeric doesn't know if his envoy lives or died—and he cannot admit he tried to break the oath without losing face.

2. **The Night Riders' Purpose:** The mysterious Night Rider clan isn't just superstitious tradition—they are the Mark's secret intelligence arm, spying on neighboring powers and eliminating threats that conventional warriors can't address. Chief Shadow-son reports directly to the High Chief.

3. **Hrothgar's Ambition:** Warlord Hrothgar has been in contact with agents of [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]], who have promised to help him become High Chief in exchange for future considerations. He doesn't know the Covenant's true nature—he thinks they're just ambitious schemers like himself.

4. **The Singing Stones:** Deep in the central plains stand ancient menhirs that resonate when certain songs are sung. The Song-Masters know these stones can be used to communicate across vast distances—and possibly more. They have kept this secret for centuries.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Stolen Stallion:** Eomeric's legendary warhorse, Thunder-Father, has been stolen. Trail leads to either Hrothgar's camp or the Ashlands—and determining which is the truth could prevent civil war or start one.

2. **The Ash Raids:** Orc attacks have reached unprecedented coordination. Someone is organizing them. The Mark needs heroes to scout the Ashlands and discover who—or what—is behind it.

3. **The Foreign Bride:** A marriage alliance with the River Compact would cement trade relations but outrage traditionalists. Someone is working to sabotage the negotiations—but who benefits most from failure?

4. **The Long Ride:** Refugees from a northern village arrived frozen half to death. They speak of the winter coming south earlier each year, of frost that kills before its season. The old songs are becoming reality.

5. **The Song of Eorl:** A dying bard claims to have recovered the complete Song of Eorl—including a lost verse that reveals the true terms of the Oath, which binds not just Aerendor but something else. He dies before revealing what.
