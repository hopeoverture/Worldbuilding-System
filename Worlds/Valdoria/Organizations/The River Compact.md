# The River Compact

> [!info] Character Summary
> A wealthy federation of seven city-states controlling the Valdris River trade, where merchants rule and gold speaks louder than swords. Neither monarchy nor democracy, it is a plutocracy where the richest families govern through the Gilded Council and everything—justice, protection, even truth—has a price. Cosmopolitan and innovative, corrupt and ruthless, the Compact represents civilization's future or its decay, depending on whom you ask.

## Overview

They say money is the lifeblood of the River Compact, and the Valdris is its great artery. This alliance of seven city-states controls the most important trade route in Valdoria—the river highway that connects [[The Iron Holds]]' mountain forges to the sea. Where [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] clings to ancient tradition and dwarven kings nurse old grudges, the Compact looks ever forward, valuing profit over heritage and innovation over honor. Here a street orphan can become a prince of commerce if clever enough, while a noble from the old kingdoms is worth only what their purse contains. The Gilded Council rules from [[Rivergard]], a city of canals and bridges that rivals any capital, and their mercenary fleets enforce a simple law: pay your debts, honor your contracts, and the Compact will make you wealthy; break them, and they will make you an example.

## Classification

### Government Type
**Type:** Plutocracy / Merchant Republic

**Subtype:** Federal oligarchy. Seven sovereign city-states bound by treaty, each ruled by its own merchant council but submitting to the Gilded Council on matters of trade, defense, and foreign policy. Power flows not from bloodline or divine right but from accumulated wealth.

### Legitimacy
**Source of Authority:** Wealth and Contract. The Compact's legitimacy rests on the compact itself—a centuries-old treaty that created mutual benefit. Those who profit accept the system; those who don't have no voice.

**Public Perception:** Tolerated. Citizens enjoy a higher standard of living than most of Valdoria, access to goods from across the world, and genuine opportunity for advancement. But they also resent the rule of the rich, the corruption that pervades every level, and the feeling that their leaders value gold over lives.

## Territory

### Extent
**Core Territories:**
- The Valdris River valley from the mountain foothills to the sea
- The river delta and coastal marshlands
- Agricultural lands on both banks
- The seven major city-states and their surrounding districts

**Vassal/Dependent Territories:**
- Numerous farming villages indebted to the banks
- Mining communities in the foothills (contested with other powers)
- Small towns along secondary rivers and trade roads

### Borders
**Natural Boundaries:**
- North: The Valdris River's northern tributaries and forested hills
- South: The foothills leading to [[The Sundered Peaks]]
- East: The Great River's upper reaches, contested with various claimants
- West: The sea and the coastal marshes

**Fortified Borders:**
- River fortresses at strategic narrows
- Toll stations controlling all river traffic
- Mercenary garrisons at border towns

**Border Disputes:**
- Toll disputes with [[The Riddle-Mark]] over eastern river traffic
- Trade conflicts with [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] over tariffs
- Occasional tensions with [[The Iron Holds]] over mining rights

**Relations with Neighbors:**
- [[Kingdom of Aerendor]]: Economic rivals, necessary trading partners
- [[The Iron Holds]]: Valuable customers and suppliers, difficult to deal with
- [[The Grey Wardens]]: Tolerated; they keep the wilderness safe for trade
- [[The Black Lotus]]: Officially enemies; practically, they're part of the system

### Capital
**Name:** [[Rivergard]] (The City of Bridges)

**Description:** A sprawling metropolis of 200,000 built across islands in the river delta, where canals serve as streets and wealth flows as readily as water. The Merchant's Palace rises at the city's heart, all gilded domes and marble columns, while around it cluster the great banking houses, trading companies, and guild halls that make the Compact run. Bridges connect everything—stone bridges, wooden bridges, bridges that lift for passing ships, bridges that house shops and homes. It is the richest city in Valdoria, beautiful and corrupt in equal measure.

**Why Located Here:** Controls the river mouth to the sea, commanding all traffic between the interior and maritime trade routes.

### Major Cities
The Seven Cities of the Compact:

1. **[[Rivergard]] (Capital):** River mouth, maritime trade, banking center. Population: ~200,000. Ruled by the Grand Mayor.

2. **Goldport:** Secondary port city, shipbuilding and fisheries. Population: ~80,000. Ruled by the Maritime Guild.

3. **Bridgewatch:** Strategic river crossing, land trade hub. Population: ~60,000. Ruled by House Ironbridge.

4. **Silverstream:** Mining town grown into a city, precious metals trade. Population: ~50,000. Ruled by the Mining Consortium.

5. **Meadowford:** Agricultural center, grain and livestock. Population: ~45,000. Ruled by House Greenfield.

6. **Oartown:** Riverboat manufacturing, skilled craftsmen. Population: ~40,000. Ruled by the Boat-Builders Guild.

7. **Far Haven:** Eastern frontier city, trade with the interior. Population: ~35,000. Ruled by House Eastmarch.

## Structure of Power

### Head of State
**Title:** Grand Mayor of the River Compact, First Among Merchants

**Current Holder:** [[Grand Mayor Lysandra]] of the Silver-Scale Banking House

**Selection Method:** Elected every five years by the Gilded Council. In practice, the position rotates among the three or four richest families, bought through favors, loans, and outright bribery.

**Term:** Five years, renewable indefinitely (but removal by the Council is always possible)

**Powers:**
- Negotiates treaties and trade agreements with foreign powers
- Commands the mercenary fleets in wartime
- Sets tariffs and trade policy (with Council approval)
- Arbitrates disputes between cities
- Represents the Compact to the outside world

### Ruling Body
**Name:** The Gilded Council

**Composition:**
- The Grand Mayor (presiding)
- The Master Merchants of each Seven City (7 seats)
- The Guild-Masters of the Major Guilds (5 seats: Banking, Maritime, Mining, Agriculture, Crafts)
- The Admiral of the Fleet (appointed)

**Powers:**
- Makes laws binding on all member cities
- Sets prices and trade regulations
- Banishes individuals from Compact territory
- Declares war and negotiates peace
- Removes the Grand Mayor (requires 10 of 14 votes)

**How Members Selected:** City seats are controlled by whoever dominates that city's council—usually the richest merchant house. Guild seats go to guild-masters elected by member merchants.

### Key Offices

| Office | Holder | Responsibilities |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Grand Mayor | [[Grand Mayor Lysandra]] | Chief executive, foreign policy, military command |
| Master of Coin | Guildmaster Aldric Goldweave | Treasury, currency, tax collection |
| Admiral of the Fleet | Commander Marcus Tideborn | Naval forces, river patrols |
| High Arbiter | Judge Helena Scales | Legal disputes, contract enforcement |
| Master of Guilds | Guildmaster Thorin Hammerbright | Guild coordination, craft standards |
| Warden of the Roads | Captain Vera Swift | Land security, caravan protection |
| Voice of the Council | Secretary Janis Quill | Records, communications, protocol |

### Succession
**Grand Mayor Selection:** When a Grand Mayor's term ends (or they die/are removed), the Gilded Council convenes to elect a successor. Voting is theoretically equal among Council members, but in practice massive bribery determines the outcome. Transitions are usually peaceful but politically intense.

**City Leadership:** Each city handles succession differently. Some are hereditary oligarchies, others elect their Master Merchants. Power changes hands through buyouts, marriages, and occasional "accidents."

**Potential Crises:** Grand Mayor Lysandra is powerful but has made enemies. If she dies suddenly, a succession war could fracture the Council between her allies and rivals.

## Administration

### Bureaucracy
**Size and Efficiency:** Efficient but venal. The Compact's administration is designed to facilitate trade, and it does so well—paperwork moves quickly, disputes are resolved, contracts are enforced. But every step requires fees, and every official expects gifts.

**Key Departments:**
- The Counting House (taxation, treasury, currency)
- The Harbor Authority (ports, shipping, customs)
- The Road Commission (land trade, caravan routes)
- The Arbitration Courts (contract disputes, debt collection)
- The Mercenary Office (military contracts, fleet management)

**Corruption Level:** High. Bribery is so institutionalized that it's barely considered corruption—"expediting fees" are simply how business is done. However, there are lines: theft from the Compact itself, betraying contracts, or cheating on taxes brings swift punishment.

**Record Keeping:** Excellent for financial matters. Every transaction, debt, and contract is meticulously documented. The Compact's archives could tell you the price of wheat in any city for the past three centuries.

### Taxation
**Types of Taxes:**
- Tariffs: Duties on all goods entering or leaving Compact territory
- Docking fees: Charges for using ports and wharves
- Transaction taxes: Percentage on all large financial deals
- License fees: Permits required for most business activities
- Property assessments: Taxes on commercial properties

**Collection Methods:** Professional tax collectors backed by mercenary enforcers. Evasion is treated as theft and punished severely.

**Tax Burden:** High for the poor, moderate for the wealthy (who know how to work the system). The total take is enormous, but the Compact provides services in return.

**Major Revenue Sources:**
- River tariffs (~40%)
- Port fees (~25%)
- Transaction taxes (~20%)
- License fees and other (~15%)

### Law & Justice
**Law Codes:** Commercial Law of the Compact—focused almost entirely on contracts, debts, and trade. Murder, theft, and other crimes exist but are treated primarily as economic damages.

**Courts:**
- The Arbitration Courts: Handle contract disputes between merchants
- The Debt Courts: Collect on defaulted loans
- The Criminal Courts: Handle "ordinary" crime
- The High Arbiter: Appeals and cases involving Council members

**Punishments:**
- Contract violations: Fines, restitution, license revocation
- Debt default: Seizure of assets, indentured servitude until paid
- Theft: Restitution plus fine; repeat offenders lose hands
- Murder: Execution or exile (unless you can pay the victim's family enough)

**Rights:**
- Contract holders have absolute right to enforcement
- Debtors have right to hearing before seizure
- Accused criminals have right to trial (if they can pay court fees)
- Foreigners have limited rights unless they have local sponsors

### Military
**Standing Forces:** The Compact maintains no national army. Instead:

**The Fleet:** ~150 river galleys and coastal ships crewed by professional sailors and marines (~8,000 total). Commanded by the Admiral, funded by the Council.

**Mercenary Companies:** The Compact contracts with several permanent mercenary companies totaling ~12,000 soldiers:
- The Golden Company: Elite heavy infantry and cavalry (~3,000)
- The River Watch: Garrison troops and patrol forces (~5,000)
- The Free Blades: Flexible contract soldiers (~4,000)

**City Guards:** Each of the Seven Cities maintains its own watch (~500-2,000 per city)

**Quality:** Variable. The Fleet is excellent; mercenary companies range from professional to barely adequate. The system works for defense but would struggle in offensive war.

## Politics

### Factions

1. **The Bankers (Conservative)**
   - **Goals:** Stability, peace, protection of existing wealth
   - **Methods:** Cautious policy, defensive spending, risk avoidance
   - **Leader:** Guildmaster Aldric Goldweave
   - **Influence:** Dominant among the old-money families

2. **The Explorers (Progressive)**
   - **Goals:** Fund expeditions to ancient ruins, expand trade routes, find new opportunities
   - **Methods:** Investment in exploration, pushing boundaries
   - **Leader:** House Eastmarch of Far Haven
   - **Influence:** Strong among younger merchants and adventurous types

3. **The Syndicates (Criminal/Pragmatic)**
   - **Goals:** Maintain their place in the system, prevent crackdowns
   - **Methods:** Bribery, coercion, providing services the law doesn't
   - **Leader:** [[The Nightmaster]] (through intermediaries)
   - **Influence:** Pervasive but hidden; represented on the Council through proxies

4. **The Reformers (Minority)**
   - **Goals:** Reduce corruption, extend rights to common citizens
   - **Methods:** Advocacy, occasional protests, appeal to self-interest
   - **Leader:** Magistrate Sera Clearwater
   - **Influence:** Weak but growing among the educated middle class

### Current Issues

1. **The Dwarven Trade:** [[High King Thrain IV]] grows more difficult; the mithril trade is too valuable to lose but increasingly costly to maintain.

2. **The Covenant Threat:** Rumors of dark cults operating in the river cities. The Order of the Silver Flame presses for greater authority to investigate.

3. **The Lotus Problem:** [[The Black Lotus]] has grown too powerful. Some want to crush them; others profit from the arrangement.

4. **The Eastern Question:** Should the Compact expand up the river, absorbing independent towns? The Explorers say yes; the Bankers fear overextension.

### Foreign Policy
**General Approach:** Pragmatic mercantilism. The Compact will trade with anyone who can pay and has no permanent friends or enemies—only permanent interests.

**Alliances:**
- No formal alliances
- Informal understandings with trading partners

**Rivalries:**
- [[Kingdom of Aerendor]]: Economic competition, tariff disputes
- [[The Riddle-Mark]]: Eastern toll conflicts

**Trade Relationships:**
- [[The Iron Holds]]: Primary source of metals, especially mithril
- [[Kingdom of Aerendor]]: Major market for imported goods
- Overseas partners: Various, through the maritime trade

**Diplomatic Style:** Everything is negotiable. Compact diplomats are merchants first, and every discussion is ultimately about price.

## Society

### Governed Population
**Population Size:** ~1,200,000 across the seven cities and dependent territories

**Major Demographics:**
- Humans: 60%
- Halflings: 20% (many in river trades)
- Gnomes: 10% (craftsmen and engineers)
- Half-Elves: 5%
- Dwarves: 3% (merchants and smiths)
- Others: 2%

**Social Classes:**
- **The Great Houses:** Ruling merchant families (~50 families)
- **The Merchants:** Successful traders and guild members (~15% of population)
- **The Artisans:** Skilled craftsmen with guild membership (~20%)
- **The Laborers:** Workers, sailors, servants (~50%)
- **The Debtors:** Those in service for unpaid debts (~10%)
- **The Outcasts:** Those expelled from respectable society (~5%)

### Rights & Freedoms
**Legal Protections:**
- Contracts are sacred and will be enforced
- Property rights are absolute (for those who have property)
- Freedom to engage in any licensed trade
- Freedom to travel within Compact territory

**Restrictions:**
- Debt is binding; defaulters can be seized
- Unlicensed business is illegal
- Guild regulations control most trades
- "Disturbing commerce" is a crime

**Class Mobility:** Unlike the old kingdoms, the Compact allows (encourages) class mobility. A clever merchant can rise from nothing; a foolish noble can fall to servitude.

### Public Services
**Infrastructure:**
- Excellent roads and bridges (tolled)
- Well-maintained ports and wharves (fees apply)
- Clean water in major cities (water tax)
- Street lighting in wealthy districts (assessment)

**Security:** Mercenary patrols keep trade routes safe; city watches maintain order in urban areas. The wilderness is less well-served.

**Welfare:** Minimal. Guilds care for their members; churches provide charity; the destitute beg or starve. The Compact believes poverty is a personal failure.

**Education:** Guild apprenticeships for trades; private tutors for the wealthy; the poor remain illiterate unless they prove exceptional.

## Economy

### Economic System
**Type:** Capitalist with guild regulations

### State Involvement
**State Enterprises:**
- The Compact Mint (currency production)
- The River Patrol (navigation safety)
- The Pilot Service (harbor navigation)

**Regulations:**
- Guilds control most trades
- Tariffs on all imports/exports
- Price controls on essential goods (loosely enforced)
- Quality standards for trade goods

**Trade Policy:** Free trade within the Compact; regulated trade with outsiders. The goal is always maximizing Compact profit.

**Currency:** The Golden River (gold coin, primary currency), the Silver Stream (silver), the Copper Current (copper). The Compact's currency is accepted throughout Valdoria.

### Wealth & Resources
**Key Resources:**
- Control of river trade (primary asset)
- Fish and agricultural products
- Skilled craftsmen and shipwrights
- Banking and financial services
- Information and contacts

**Major Industries:**
- Trade and commerce (dominant)
- Banking and finance
- Shipbuilding
- Fishing
- Luxury crafts

**Economic Health:** Strong. The Compact is the richest region in Valdoria by per-capita measures. Wealth is extremely unequal, but even laborers live better than peasants elsewhere.

## History

### Founding
The River Compact emerged from rebellion. In the 600s RS, the river towns were subjects of [[Kingdom of Aerendor]], forced to pay crippling taxes on all trade. In 642 RS, seven cities signed the Valdris Compact, forming a defensive and commercial alliance. Two decades of conflict followed before Aerendor, weakened by other problems, recognized their independence in 665 RS. The Compact has governed itself ever since.

### Major Eras

**The Founding Era (~600-800 RS):**
Consolidation and growth. The newly independent cities built their institutions, established trade routes, and accumulated wealth. The Gilded Council took its current form.

**The Golden Age (~800-1200 RS):**
Explosive prosperity. The Compact became the economic center of Valdoria, its merchants reaching every corner of the known world. [[Rivergard]] grew into a great city.

**The Troubles (~1200-1500 RS):**
Challenges and adaptation. Piracy, plague, and political instability tested the Compact. Several attempts at reform failed, but the federation survived.

**The Modern Era (~1500 RS-present):**
Stable prosperity with growing problems. The Compact remains wealthy but faces new challenges—rising criminal influence, external threats, and internal inequality.

### Recent History
**Grand Mayor Lysandra's Rise (1975-1982 RS):** Born in Rivergard's slums, Lysandra built a banking fortune through brilliant deals and ruthless competition. She bought her way onto the Council, then purchased enough support to become Grand Mayor. Her rule has been efficient if cold, focused on profit and order.

**The Lotus Arrangement (1980 RS):** After the previous attempt to crush [[The Black Lotus]] resulted in chaos, Lysandra negotiated an informal accommodation. The Lotus keeps crime organized and controlled; the Council pretends not to notice. Critics call it surrender; pragmatists call it governance.

### Current Situation
The River Compact is wealthy and stable but rotting from within. Corruption pervades every level; [[The Black Lotus]] operates with near-impunity; and the gap between rich and poor grows yearly. Grand Mayor Lysandra maintains order through competence and fear, but she has made enemies. The Covenant has agents in the city (Lysandra suspects but cannot prove it), and darker forces stir in the wider world. The Compact's leaders care only for profit; they may not see the threat until it's too late.

## Key Figures

### Current Ruler
**Name:** [[Grand Mayor Lysandra]]
**Title:** Grand Mayor of the River Compact, First Among Merchants
**Description:** A woman in her fifties with calculating eyes and a smile that never reaches them. She rose from the slums through intelligence, ruthlessness, and a willingness to do whatever the deal required. She speaks softly, dresses simply (by Compact standards), and controls one of the largest banking houses in Valdoria. She knows every secret worth knowing and has leverage on half the Council. She is not loved, but she is effective—and she intends to keep her position until she chooses to leave it.

### Major Officials

1. **Guildmaster Aldric Goldweave (Master of Coin):** An elderly dwarf who has managed Compact finances for three decades. Conservative, meticulous, and quietly alarmed at spending trends. He knows where every copper goes.

2. **Admiral Marcus Tideborn:** Commander of the Fleet, a former merchant captain who rose through ability. Practical and apolitical, he cares only for his ships and crews.

3. **Judge Helena Scales (High Arbiter):** The Compact's chief legal authority. Brilliant, incorruptible, and universally respected—which is why she has no real power. She serves as a symbol of justice while real decisions happen elsewhere.

4. **[[The Nightmaster]] (Criminal Influence):** The mysterious leader of [[The Black Lotus]] reportedly has proxies on the Council itself. No one knows their identity, but everyone knows their influence.

## Secrets

1. **The Grand Mayor's Price:** Lysandra pays [[The Black Lotus]] a percentage of certain customs revenues in exchange for maintaining order in the slums and keeping violent crime controlled. This "arrangement" would destroy her if proven.

2. **Covenant Infiltration:** Several minor merchants on guild councils are Covenant agents, using trade routes to move resources and information. Lysandra suspects something but has prioritized other threats.

3. **The Banking Crisis:** One of the great banking houses (House Silverstream) is technically insolvent, its assets tied up in bad loans. A run on the bank could crash the entire Compact financial system. The Council is quietly arranging a bailout.

4. **The Fleet's Loyalty:** Admiral Tideborn has been approached by agents of [[Kingdom of Aerendor]] about switching allegiance. He hasn't agreed, but he hasn't refused—waiting to see which way the wind blows.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Blockade:** A rival city is blocking the river upstream, claiming "plague" but really seeking higher tariffs. The Council needs someone to investigate—and possibly break the blockade.

2. **The Ruin Expedition:** The Explorers' faction is hiring adventurers to map ancient ruins before looters destroy everything valuable. The ruins may contain more than treasure.

3. **The Bank Run:** Someone is spreading rumors about House Silverstream. Stop the panic, find the source, and discover who profits from Compact instability.

4. **The Lotus War:** A violent gang from [[The Free Towns]] is challenging Black Lotus territory. The Lotus wants them eliminated; the Council officially knows nothing. Who do you work for?

5. **The Covenant Connection:** A captured Covenant agent claims high-level protection in Rivergard. Investigate without alerting the protected party—or becoming their next target.
