# The River Compact

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A wealthy, pragmatic dominance of trade. Think Venice, the Hanseatic League, or Lake-town. They control the flow of goods along the great river. Cosmopolitan but greedy.

## Overview
The River Compact is an alliance of seven major city-states along the Valdris River. They control trade between the mountains and the sea. While they have no king, their "Grand Mayor" wields immense influence through coin. It is a land of opportunity, where a peasant can become a prince, but also of cutthroat politics and deep corruption.
