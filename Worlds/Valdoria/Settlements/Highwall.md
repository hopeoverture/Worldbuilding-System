# Highwall (Rammas Echor)

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A fortress-town that acts as the gateway to the Valdris Vale. It is grim, disciplined, and heavily fortified. It exists to tax trade and stop armies.

## Overview
Highwall stands at the narrowest point of the river pass, its massive white walls (built by Elves in the First Age) spanning the entire valley. Nothing enters or leaves the Vale without passing through its gates. It is a town of soldiers, smiths, and toll-collectors.

## Districts
1.  **The Gate Ward:** The busy district around the main gate. Inns for caravan guards and stables.
2.  **The Soldier's Tier:** Barracks and training grounds restricted to civilians.
3.  **The Undercroft:** Ancient storage vaults beneath the walls, rumored to hold contraband.

## Notable Features
- **The Echor Wall:** The wall itself is 300 feet high and seemingly seamless. It glows faintly at night.
- **The Toll Bridge:** A massive drawbridge that can be raised to seal the river.

## Politics & Ruler
**[[Commander Kaelen]]:** A veteran of the False King's War. He is loyal to [[The River Compact]] but hates the corruption of Rivergard. He runs Highwall with iron discipline.

## Current Problems
1.  **The Smugglers:** [[The Black Lotus]] has found a way past the wall (perhaps a tunnel?), bypassing Kaelen's tolls.
2.  **The Monster Raids:** Orc raiding parties are testing the outer defenses more frequently.

## Economics
- **Primary Export:** Protection (Tolls), Weapons.
- **Primary Import:** Food (they can't grow enough).

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Spy:** Kaelen hires the party to find the Lotus spy in his ranks.
2.  **The Siege:** The town comes under sudden attack by a massive warband; the party must hold the gate.

## Image Prompts
### Town View
**Prompt:** A massive white stone wall spanning a foggy valley between two mountains. A grim stone town clings to the inner side of the wall. Military banners.
