# Oakhaven

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> A quiet, eerie village on the edge of the Whisperwood. The buildings are grown from living trees or built into giant stumps. It is the headquarters of the Grey Wardens in this region.

## Overview
Oakhaven is the last stop before the Deep Woods. Loggers come here to trade rare timber, and druids come to commune with the ancient spirits. The air is always thick with a sweet, heavy fog. The villagers are superstitious and wary of strangers who don't respect the "Old Ways."

## Notable Locations
1.  **The Green Man Inn:** An inn built inside a hollowed-out giant oak. The ale is brewed with strange herbs.
2.  **The Circle of Stones:** A small druidic circle on a hill where [[The Grey Wardens]] meet.
3.  **The Sawmill:** Water-powered, but careful not to pollute the stream.

## Notable Features
- **The Wards:** Carved totems surround the village. At night, they hum to keep the "Dark Things" of the woods at bay.
- **The Silence:** It is unnaturally quiet here. Birds rarely sing in the village itself.

## Key NPCs
- **[[Elder Thorn]]:** An ancient, blind Druid who "sees" through his raven familiar.
- **[[Captain Aris]]:** A retired Ranger who trains the village militia.

## Current Problems
1.  **The Corrupted Timber:** Recent trees felled near the village bleed black sap. The loggers are getting sick.
2.  **The Missing Hunters:** Three hunters went into the woods a week ago and haven't returned.

## Economy
- **Exports:** Ironwood, Rare Herbs, Furs.
- **Imports:** Metal tools, Salt.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Beast:** A corrupted bear attacks the sawmill; the party tracks it back to a source of dark magic.
2.  **The Warning:** Elder Thorn gives the party a cryptic prophecy about the "Shackled God waking."

## Image Prompts
### Village View
**Prompt:** Small cottages covered in moss and vines, nestled among giant ancient trees. Glowing lanterns hang from branches. Mist swirls on the ground. Mystical, cozy but slightly creepy.
