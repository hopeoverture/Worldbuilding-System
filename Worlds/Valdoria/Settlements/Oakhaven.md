# Oakhaven

> [!info] Character Summary
> A quiet, eerie village on the edge of the Whisperwood where the Old Ways still hold sway. Buildings are grown from living trees or built into ancient stumps, and druidic wards keep the "Dark Things" of the forest at bay. It serves as the last outpost of civilization before the deep wilderness and the regional headquarters of [[The Grey Wardens]].

## Overview

Oakhaven sits at the boundary between the tamed lands and the ancient wilderness, a village where humans and wood elves have coexisted for centuries under the watchful guidance of druids. The buildings seem to grow from the earth itself—cottages nestled in giant hollow oaks, homes built into massive stumps, walls woven from living vines. A perpetual mist hangs over the village, sweet and heavy with the scent of ancient herbs, and an unnatural silence pervades that visitors find either peaceful or deeply unsettling. The villagers follow the "Old Ways," respecting the spirits of the wood and the druidic circle that protects them from the darkness that stirs in the deep forest.

## Geography

### Location
Oakhaven occupies a clearing in the southwestern reaches of the Whisperwood, approximately three miles from where the forest meets the open farmlands of [[The Westmark]]. The village sits in a natural depression where a spring-fed stream emerges from beneath ancient roots, creating a small pond before winding deeper into the woods. To the north lies only forest—miles of increasingly wild woodland that grows darker and stranger the deeper one ventures. The nearest other settlement is [[Millbrook]], a farming village two days' travel southeast.

### Climate
The Whisperwood creates its own microclimate. Morning fogs are perpetual, burning off by midday only to return at dusk. Summers are cool and shadowed beneath the ancient canopy, while winters bring heavy snows that isolate the village for weeks at a time. Rain falls gently and often, filtered through layers of leaves into a constant soft dripping that becomes the village's heartbeat.

### Layout
The village has no central square or formal streets. Buildings cluster organically around the Spring Pond, connected by winding paths of packed earth and ancient flagstones that seem to shift position between visits. The druidic Circle of Stones crowns the hill northeast of the village, visible from anywhere in the clearing. Carved wooden totems mark the village's boundaries, humming softly at night with protective magic.

## Demographics

### Population
The population is small but remarkably stable across generations.

**Total Population:** ~600

**Breakdown:**
- Permanent residents: 550 (farmers, loggers, hunters, craftspeople)
- Seasonal workers: 30-50 (timber crews, herb gatherers)
- Grey Warden presence: ~20 (rangers, druids, and trainees)

### Races & Cultures
The population reflects centuries of human-elven coexistence:
- **Humans (50%):** Primarily descendants of settlers who came three centuries ago, now thoroughly adapted to forest life
- **Wood Elves (40%):** The Eryn-folk who lived here before humans arrived, now integrated but maintaining distinct traditions
- **Halflings (10%):** Several extended families who've operated the village's hospitality and trade services for generations

Cultural mixing is deep and genuine. Many families have both human and elven blood; the Old Ways are practiced by all regardless of ancestry. The primary tension isn't racial but generational—younger residents sometimes chafe under strict druidic traditions.

### Social Structure
Social hierarchy is based on wisdom and connection to the land:
- **The Elders:** The druidic circle and village council, respected as spiritual and practical leaders
- **The Wardens:** Rangers of the Grey Wardens, honored protectors who operate somewhat outside village hierarchy
- **Skilled Woodsfolk:** Master loggers, herbalists, and hunters who know the forest's secrets
- **Common Residents:** Farmers, craftspeople, and service providers
- **Outsiders:** Traders and travelers, treated with cautious hospitality

## Government & Law

### Leadership
Decision-making follows ancient druidic traditions:

**Type:** Council of Elders

**Current Leader:** [[Elder Thorn]], an ancient blind druid who "sees" through his raven familiar, Nightwing

**How Chosen:** Elders are recognized by the community through demonstrated wisdom and connection to the land; there is no formal election or inheritance

### Decision Making
Major decisions require consensus among the five Elders, achieved through discussion that can last days if necessary. Minor matters are handled by whoever has relevant expertise. Disputes between villagers are mediated by Elders, with the forest spirits occasionally consulted through divination. Punishments are rarely physical—exile to the deep woods for a night being the most severe, relying on the forest's own judgment.

### Outside Authority
Oakhaven technically falls within [[The Westmark]], which itself answers to the [[Kingdom of Aerendor]]. In practice:
- Taxes are paid in rare timber and herbs rather than coin
- Royal officials visit perhaps once per decade
- The village handles its own justice entirely
- Military obligations are fulfilled through Grey Warden service
- Outsiders who try to assert authority tend to get lost in the woods repeatedly

## Economy

### Primary Industry
**Industry:** Rare Timber Harvesting

**Details:**
- **Products:** Ironwood (nearly metal-hard lumber), Silverleaf (magical reagent), Heartwood (prized for instruments and wands)
- **Seasonal Cycles:** Harvesting only in autumn when the trees "release" certain branches; spring and summer are forbidden
- **Ownership:** The forest provides; no one owns the trees, but harvesting rights are governed by druidic approval
- **Reputation:** Oakhaven timber commands premium prices throughout the kingdom—and the forest never provides more than the village needs

### Secondary Activities
- **Herbalism:** Rare medicinal and magical plants gathered by trained collectors
- **Hunting and Trapping:** Furs and preserved meats, taken only from "willing" game
- **Hospitality:** Services for the steady trickle of merchants, pilgrims, and adventurers

### Trade
- **Exports:** Ironwood, rare herbs, quality furs, warden-made equipment
- **Imports:** Metal tools, salt, manufactured goods, news from the outside world
- **Trade Schedule:** Timber merchants arrive monthly during harvest season; other traders come irregularly
- **Nearest Market:** [[Millbrook]] (limited), [[Lond Daer]] (major market, five days' travel)

### Wealth Level
**Level:** Comfortable

**Evidence:** No one is hungry, all homes are well-maintained, but there's little coin and fewer luxuries. Wealth is measured in skills, relationships, and the forest's favor rather than gold.

## Culture & Religion

### Daily Life
Life in Oakhaven follows the forest's rhythms rather than the clock. Villagers rise with the dawn-birds' calls and retire when the night-mist rolls in. Work is communal—logging crews, hunting parties, and harvest groups form and dissolve as needed. Meals are often shared among neighbors, and children wander freely, knowing the ward-totems will protect them from straying too deep. Silence is valued; even the children learn to move quietly, and shouting is considered rude.

### Traditions
1. **The First Green:** Spring festival celebrating the forest's awakening, featuring offerings to tree spirits and the year's first blessing of the logging tools
2. **The Warden's Watch:** Midsummer gathering where Grey Wardens share news of the deep woods and children are tested for potential training
3. **The Harvest Moon:** Autumn celebration marking the beginning of logging season, the only time music and noise are encouraged
4. **The Silent Night:** Midwinter observance when all fires are extinguished and villagers sit in darkness, listening for omens from the deep forest

### Religion
Spiritual life centers on the Old Ways rather than the formal pantheon:
- **Primary Practice:** Druidic nature worship, honoring the spirits of trees, streams, and animals
- **Religious Site:** The Circle of Stones, a small druidic circle on a hill where [[The Grey Wardens]] meet
- **Religious Leader:** [[Elder Thorn]], who serves as both civic leader and high druid
- **Devoutness:** Universal among permanent residents; the ward-totems that protect the village require collective belief to function

Secondary acknowledgment exists for [[The Silver Flame]]—a small shrine is maintained for travelers who prefer formal worship.

### Superstitions
- **The Silence:** Birds don't sing within the village itself. Locals believe this is because the forest spirits are always listening. When birds do sing, something is wrong.
- **The Asking:** Before felling a tree, a logger must ask its permission three times on three consecutive nights. Trees that refuse (determined by druidic divination) are never touched.
- **The Deep Things:** Something lives in the forest's heart that even the druids respect. Villagers don't speak of it directly, only as "what walks beneath."

## Defense & Security

### Threats
The village faces dangers both mundane and supernatural:
- **Natural Threats:** Wolves, bears, occasional disease
- **Supernatural Threats:** Corrupted beasts from the deep woods, dark fey, things that have awakened as [[The Shackled God]]'s seals weaken
- **Human Threats:** Rare bandit incursions, occasional poachers who ignore harvesting rules
- **Current Crisis:** Trees near the village have begun bleeding black sap; hunters are disappearing

### Defenses
Protection is magical rather than physical:
- **The Ward-Totems:** Carved posts surrounding the village that hum with protective magic, keeping "Dark Things" at bay
- **Natural Barriers:** The forest itself discourages hostile approach, paths seeming to shift for enemies
- **Early Warning:** Druids receive visions of approaching threats; animals serve as scouts
- **Safe Refuge:** The Green Man Inn has reinforced walls and can shelter the entire village

### Militia
Combat capability is limited but specialized:
- **Fighters:** All adults can use hunting bows and woodcutting tools as weapons
- **Weapons:** Logging axes, hunting bows, skinning knives—no formal military equipment
- **Leadership:** [[Captain Aris]], a retired ranger, trains a village militia of twenty volunteers
- **Experience:** Two generations since serious violence; the wards have always protected them

## History

### Founding
Oakhaven was founded around 700 RS when human settlers discovered the Eryn-folk—wood elves who had lived in this clearing since the Age of Myth. Rather than conflict, the two peoples formed an alliance. The elves taught the humans the Old Ways, and the humans brought trade connections to the outside world. The druidic circle that would become the Grey Wardens formed to formalize this partnership.

### Significant Events
1. **The Pact of Living Wood (702 RS):** Founding agreement between humans and Eryn-folk, still honored today
2. **The Blight Winter (1203 RS):** A supernatural corruption spread from the deep woods; half the village died before Elder Mossbeard sacrificed himself to seal the darkness
3. **The Warden's Charter (1456 RS):** The Grey Wardens received formal recognition from Aerendor, granting Oakhaven protected status
4. **The Recent Troubles (1987 RS):** Beginning six months ago—corrupted timber, missing hunters, and whispers of "the Shackled God waking"

### Current Situation
Something is deeply wrong. Trees that have stood for centuries are bleeding black ichor when cut. Three hunting parties have vanished in the past month. [[Elder Thorn]] speaks of dreams where chains shatter and something vast stirs beneath the mountains. The wards still hold, but they've begun to flicker at night. The Grey Wardens are investigating, and the village has quietly begun stockpiling supplies and sharpening weapons they hoped never to need.

## Notable Locations

### 1. The Spring Pond
**Type:** Village Green / Central Gathering Place

**Description:** A crystal-clear pond fed by an underground spring, surrounded by ancient willows whose trailing branches create natural curtains. The water never freezes, never muddies, and tastes faintly of honey. Villagers gather here for community meetings, celebrations, and daily gossip.

**What Happens Here:** Social center of the village; water drawn for drinking and rituals; children play along its banks

### 2. The Green Man Inn
**Type:** Inn/Tavern

**Name:** The Green Man

**Proprietor:** Hollow Hob, a jovial halfling whose family has run the inn for twelve generations

**Description:** Built inside a hollowed-out oak tree so massive that the common room seats fifty. Rooms are carved into the trunk above. The ale is brewed with herbs that induce peaceful sleep, and the fire in the hearth has never gone out in three hundred years.

**Special Features:** Reinforced walls can shelter the entire village; secret tunnel to the Circle of Stones

### 3. The Circle of Stones
**Type:** Druidic Circle / Sacred Site

**Dedicated To:** The spirits of the forest; the Old Ways

**Description:** A ring of standing stones on a hilltop, carved with spirals and leaf patterns that seem to shift in moonlight. The grass within the circle grows silver-green, and no shadow falls there even at midnight.

**Significance:** Meeting place of the Grey Wardens; site of major rituals; the village's spiritual heart

### 4. Elder Thorn's Tree
**Type:** Leader's Residence

**Description:** A living house grown from a still-rooted oak, its interior shaped by decades of druidic magic. Roots form furniture, leaves filter sunlight, and the walls occasionally whisper advice. Elder Thorn has lived here for over a century.

**Access:** Open to villagers with concerns; outsiders by invitation

### 5. The Old Sawmill
**Type:** Industrial Site / Point of Interest

**Description:** A water-powered sawmill at the edge of the village, carefully positioned to avoid polluting the stream. The oldest structure built by human settlers, its mechanisms are maintained by combined human engineering and elven woodcraft.

**Current Concern:** The corrupted timber recently processed here has made several workers ill with fever dreams

## Notable Figures

### Village Leader
**Name:** [[Elder Thorn]]
**Role:** High Druid and Council Head
**Brief Description:** An ancient wood elf, well over 600 years old, whose eyes turned white with blindness a century ago. He "sees" through Nightwing, his raven familiar, who perches constantly on his shoulder. His voice is soft as rustling leaves, but when he speaks, the forest itself seems to listen. He knows the corruption spreading through the woods is connected to something vast and terrible—and fears Oakhaven stands at the center of what's coming.

### Key Service Provider
**Name:** Hollow Hob
**Role:** Innkeeper
**Brief Description:** A round, perpetually cheerful halfling who has heard every story the road has to offer and tells better ones himself. His jolly demeanor hides sharp observation—nothing happens in his inn that Hob doesn't notice and remember. He secretly passes information to the Grey Wardens.

### Local Character
**Name:** Old Moss
**Role:** Hermit / Eccentric
**Brief Description:** An elderly human woman who lives at the village's edge and claims to hear the trees talking. Most dismiss her as addled, but Elder Thorn consults her privately. She's been increasingly agitated lately, saying the trees are screaming.

### Person with a Secret
**Name:** Fern Willowbark
**Role:** Apprentice Herbalist
**Brief Description:** A young half-elf woman training under the village healer, known for her skill with medicines and her kind heart. She discovered one of the corrupted trees weeks before anyone else—and touched the black sap. Something has been whispering to her since, promising power if she helps it wake.
**Secret:** She's been leaving the ward-totems slightly misaligned at night, weakening the village's protection without understanding why she feels compelled to do so.

### Grey Warden Leader
**Name:** [[Captain Aris]]
**Role:** Retired Ranger / Militia Commander
**Brief Description:** A scarred human woman in her sixties who served the Wardens for forty years before retiring to train the next generation. She walks with a limp from an old wound that never healed right, but her bow arm is still deadly. She's organizing the search parties for the missing hunters—and finding tracks that shouldn't exist.

## Secrets

1. **The First Seal's Echo:** Oakhaven was built over a minor seal-point connected to [[The Shackled God]]'s prison. The ward-totems aren't just protecting against forest spirits—they're reinforcing a seal that's beginning to crack.

2. **The Covenant's Eyes:** A [[Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]] agent has been living in the village for two years, posing as a timber merchant's assistant. They've been mapping the seal-point and reporting to [[The Prophet of Chains]].

3. **Elder Thorn's Burden:** The high druid knows exactly what's happening—he was a child during the Blight Winter and saw the same signs before. He's preparing a sacrifice ritual that may seal the corruption again, but it requires a willing death. He's planning to give his own life.

4. **The Missing Hunters:** The hunters aren't dead. They found something in the deep woods—an entrance to tunnels leading toward [[The Citadel of Tears]]—and were captured by Cult of the Shackled God agents who are using them as laborers.

## Plot Hooks

1. **[[The Whispering Caves]]:** The nearby [[Old Echo Mine]] has become a source of corruption. Goblins driven mad by a Shard of Shadow have begun raiding, and the village needs heroes to investigate.

2. **The Beast:** A corrupted bear attacks the sawmill, its fur matted with black ichor. Tracking it leads to a source of spreading darkness in the deep forest.

3. **The Warning:** Elder Thorn gives the party a cryptic prophecy about "the chains breaking" and sends them to find answers at [[The Citadel of Tears]].

4. **The Spy Among Us:** The Grey Wardens suspect a Covenant agent in the village. The party must identify them before the next ritual alignment, when the wards will be temporarily weakened.

## Rumors & Gossip

1. Elder Thorn can see the future, not just through his raven—that's why he's been so quiet lately. He's seen the village's destruction. (Partially True—he's seen possible futures)
2. The missing hunters found elven treasure in the deep woods and ran off with it. (False—they were captured)
3. Old Moss isn't crazy. The trees really do talk to her, and they're terrified. (True)
4. The corruption started when a stranger passed through six months ago, carrying a black sword wrapped in chains. (True—it was a Covenant courier)
