# Rivergard

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> The "Venice" of Valdoria. Built atop the flooded ruins of an ancient Elven capital. It is a city of stunning wealth and crushing poverty, where the canals reflect both marble palaces and the slums of the "Drowning Wards."

## Overview
Rivergard is the beating heart of commerce in [[Thondorian]]. Situated in the delta of the Valdris River, it controls all trade between the [[The Iron Holds]] and the sea. To the wealthy, it is a paradise of art and luxury. To the poor, it is a fight for survival in the sinking lower districts.

## Districts
1.  **The Gilded Isles:** The central archipelago where the Merchant Princes live. Paved in white stone, patrolled by private guards.
    - *Key Location:* **The Silver-Scale Bank**. The true seat of power.
2.  **The Explorers' Quarter:** A bustling district of map-makers, scholars, and dusty shops.
    - *Key Location:* **The Hall of Discovery** (HQ of [[The Valdorian Explorers League]]).
3.  **The Drowning Wards (The Undercity):** The lower levels that are slowly sinking into the river. Wooden walkways connect rooftops of submerged ruins.
    - *Key Location:* **The Black Market**. Controlled by [[The Black Lotus]].

## Notable Features
- **The Sunken City:** Rivergard is built *on top* of the ancient Elven city of [[Ost-in-Edhil]]. In clear weather, you can look down into the canals and see the spires and domes of the First Age city below.
- **The Great Chain:** A massive iron chain that can be raised to block the harbor entrance.

## Current Problems
1.  **The Rising Tide:** The river level is rising unnaturally. Black, oily water sets huge sections of the Drowning Wards at risk. Some say it is the tears of the Shackled God.
2.  **The Trade War:** Tensions with [[The Riddle-Mark]] are high; merchant ships are being raided.
3.  **The Silent Plague:** Rumors of the "Plague of Silence" returning in the slums are being suppressed by the Council.

## Key NPCs
- **[[Grand Mayor Lysandra]]:** (Human, Rogue/Mastermind) Calculated, ruthless, but genuinely loves the city.
- **[[Guildmaster Garrick]]:** (Gnome, Artificer) Head of the Explorers. Obsessed with the ruins below.
- **[[The Nightmaster]]:** (Unknown) Shadow ruler of the Drowning Wards.

## Economy & Trade
- **Imports:** Ore (Iron Holds), Grain (Riddle-Mark), Timber (Whisperwood).
- **Exports:** Luxury goods, Spices, Glasswork, Mercenaries.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Divers:** The Explorers League hires the party to dive into a specific sunken ruin to retrieve a seal... but the Black Lotus wants it too.
2.  **The Blockade:** The party must run a blockade to get medicine into the city.
