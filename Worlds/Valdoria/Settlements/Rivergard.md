# Rivergard

> [!info] Character Summary
> The beating heart of continental trade, Rivergard is a city of stunning contrasts—marble palaces rising above flooded slums, obscene wealth floating over crushing poverty. Built atop the sunken ruins of the ancient elven capital Ost-in-Edhil, the city controls all commerce between the [[The Iron Holds|Iron Holds]] and the sea. The [[Gilded Council]] of Merchant Princes rules through gold rather than blood, and the true power lies not in government buildings but in counting houses. Beneath the glittering surface, the [[The Black Lotus]] controls the criminal underworld, ancient elven ruins hold dangerous secrets, and the rising waters threaten to swallow the lower districts entirely.

## Overview

Rivergard is the wealthiest city in the known world, a fact its Merchant Princes never let visitors forget. Situated where the Valdris River delta meets the Sundering Sea, the city controls the only viable water route between the dwarven [[The Iron Holds|Iron Holds]] and international maritime trade. Every bar of dwarven iron, every gem from the deep places, every import from distant lands—all must pass through Rivergard's canals and pay its tolls. The city is built atop the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil, an elven metropolis that sank during [[The Betrayal]]. On clear days, looking down through the canals reveals spires, domes, and streets from the [[Age of Myth]] preserved beneath the water. The contrast between the city's obscene wealth and its desperate poverty defines Rivergard: the Merchant Princes dine on golden plates while children in the Drowning Wards fight over scraps. It is a city where anything can be bought, everything has a price, and the only sin is being poor.

## Geography

### Location
Rivergard sits in the Valdris River delta, where the great river splits into a dozen channels before reaching the Sundering Sea. The city occupies a natural archipelago of islands and sandbars, connected by over three hundred bridges—some elven work of impossible grace, others crude wooden constructions that sway in storms. The ancient elven city beneath provides a stable foundation for the heavier structures, though sections continue to sink. The harbor is protected by a natural breakwater and can shelter hundreds of vessels. Major approaches include the River Road from the north (connecting to [[Highwall]] and beyond), the Sea Gate for maritime traffic, and the Smugglers' Routes through the marshes that the authorities pretend don't exist.

### Climate
Maritime temperate with persistent fog, especially in autumn and winter. The salt air carries the smell of the sea and, in the Drowning Wards, less pleasant odors. Summer brings humid heat that makes the canals fragrant; winter brings cold rain that drives the poor to desperate measures for warmth. The city receives enough rainfall that fresh water isn't scarce, though the cisterns that collect it are controlled by guilds who charge accordingly.

### Layout
Rivergard has no single center but rather a hierarchy of islands. The Gilded Isles at the city's heart hold the wealthiest districts, built on the most stable foundations. Surrounding these, the Middle Quarters host merchants, guilds, and respectable businesses. Beyond them, the Outer Islands hold the working class. And sinking beneath them all, the Drowning Wards—the lowest districts where the ancient ruins breach the surface and the poor live in buildings half-submerged. Navigation is by boat through major canals or by bridge and walkway through narrow passages. Getting lost is easy; hiring a guide is wise.

## Districts

### 1. The Gilded Isles
**Character:** Opulent, exclusive, paranoid

**Key Features:** White marble paving, private gondola docks, armed guards at every bridge. The Merchant Princes' palaces compete to display wealth through architecture, art, and magical illumination.

**Who Lives/Works Here:** The twelve Merchant Prince families, high-ranking servants, personal guards, and those wealthy enough to buy residence.

**Notable Locations:**
- **The Silver-Scale Bank:** The true seat of power—this ancient vault built into elven foundations holds the wealth of nations. Its records contain secrets that could topple governments.
- **The Grand Canal Palace:** The official seat of the Gilded Council, though real decisions happen in private manors.
- **The Crystal Gardens:** An artificial paradise under a glass dome where exotic plants from across the world grow.

### 2. The Merchant Quarter
**Character:** Bustling, cosmopolitan, transactional

**Key Features:** Counting houses, trade offices, warehouses, and the great auction halls where fortunes change hands daily.

**Who Lives/Works Here:** Traders, factors, clerks, foreign merchants, and the ambitious hoping to join the elite.

**Notable Locations:**

- **The Hall of Many Voices:** A neutral ground where representatives of different faiths can meet.
- **The Beggars' Steps:** The cathedral's steps where the desperate congregate, hoping for charity.

### 4. The Crafters' Islands

- **The Dive:** A tavern catering to salvage divers who explore the sunken city below.

### 6. The Drowning Wards (The Undercity)
**Character:** Desperate, dangerous, resourceful

**Key Features:** Buildings half-submerged, wooden walkways connecting rooftops, the constant threat of rising water. Ancient elven architecture breaks through here—towers emerge from canals, and some residents live in structures that were once second-floor apartments.

**Who Lives/Works Here:** The poor, criminals, the desperate, and those who don't want to be found.

**Notable Locations:**

- **The Rat Warrens:** A maze of interconnected basements and elven chambers where the Lotus operates.
- **The Drowned Temple:** An elven temple to a forgotten god, now used by a mystery cult.

### 7. The Harbor District
**Character:** Rough, international, chaotic

**Key Features:** Wharves, warehouses, taverns, and businesses catering to sailors. The smell of salt, fish, and tar defines the area.

**Who Lives/Works Here:** Sailors, stevedores, shipwrights, merchants, and those who prey on all of the above.

**Notable Locations:**
- **The Great Chain:** The massive harbor chain that can seal the port; raising it requires the Grand Mayor's order.
- **The Sailor's Rest:** A massive tavern complex catering to every maritime need and vice.
- **The Customs House:** Where duties are assessed, bribes are paid, and cargo manifests are creatively interpreted.

## Demographics

### Population
**Total Population:** ~120,000 permanent residents; ~30,000 transient (sailors, merchants, visitors)

**Density:** Extremely crowded in lower districts; spacious in the Gilded Isles

**Growth:** Stable overall; lower districts growing as rural poor seek opportunity

### Races & Cultures
- **Humans (60%):** Dominant in commerce and government; diverse origins
- **Halflings (15%):** Significant minority; often in service industries and crafts; the Halfling Quarter in the Middle Islands maintains its own culture
- **Half-Elves (10%):** Drawn by the elven ruins; some claim descent from Ost-in-Edhil's survivors
- **Gnomes (5%):** Concentrated in the Crafters' Islands; especially prominent in glasswork
- **Other (10%):** Dwarven trade factors, elven visitors (rare), and exotic species from distant lands

### Social Classes
**Merchant Princes:** Twelve families control most wealth and all political power. They live in the Gilded Isles, intermarry strategically, and compete ruthlessly while presenting unified front to outsiders.

**Guild Masters & Wealthy Merchants:** The aspiring elite. Rich enough for comfort, ambitious for more. They live in the better Middle Islands and plot to join the Princes.

**Craftsmen & Common Merchants:** Skilled workers with guild protection. Life is decent if precarious. One bad deal, one illness, and they slide toward the Drowning Wards.

**Laborers & Servants:** The vast majority. They work the docks, crew the ships, and serve the wealthy. They live in crowded tenements and have little security.

**The Drowned:** Those in the Drowning Wards. No legal protection, no guild membership, surviving through labor, crime, or charity. Many are former craftsmen who fell on hard times.

## Government & Politics

### Government Type
**Type:** Oligarchy (The Gilded Council)

**Official Structure:** The Grand Mayor presides over the Gilded Council of twelve Merchant Princes. The Council sets policy, the Mayor executes it. In theory, the Council is elected; in practice, the same twelve families have held seats for generations.

**Reality of Power:** Gold rules Rivergard. The Council's decisions are determined by economic interests. The Grand Mayor has significant independent authority but must maintain Council support to remain in office.

### Current Ruler
**Title & Name:** [[Grand Mayor Lysandra]]

**In Power Since:** 7 years

**How She Rules:** Through calculation, compromise, and careful manipulation. Lysandra genuinely wants what's best for Rivergard—she simply believes that what's best for her is also best for the city.

**Public Perception:** Respected, feared, and suspected. Common folk know she's dangerous but also competent.

**Greatest Concern:** The rising waters in the Drowning Wards—not from compassion, but because instability there threatens the whole city.

### Political Factions

1. **The Traditionalists:** Want to maintain current power structures; resist any change that might upset the balance; led by Prince Aldric of House Varen.

2. **The Expansionists:** Push for aggressive trade expansion, even if it risks war; want to challenge the Iron Holds' monopoly on certain goods; led by Princess Selene of House Goldmoor.

3. **The Reformers:** A minority faction advocating for investment in the lower districts and guild reform; seen as dangerous idealists; led by Prince Marcus of House Brightwater.

4. **The Covenant Sympathizers:** A secret faction with hidden allegiances to the Covenant of the Unveiled Truth; working to destabilize the city for unclear purposes.

5. **The Black Lotus:** Not an official faction, but [[The Nightmaster]] exerts considerable influence through bribes, blackmail, and strategic violence.

### Laws & Justice
- **Legal Code:** Complex and heavily favoring the wealthy. Contracts are sacred; breaking one can result in debt slavery.
- **Courts:** Merchant Courts handle commercial disputes; Criminal Courts handle everything else. Judges are appointed (and bribed) by the Council.
- **Punishment:** Fines for the rich; imprisonment, labor, or execution for the poor. Debtors can be sold into service.
- **Notable Laws:** Carrying weapons in the Gilded Isles is forbidden without a license (expensive). Interfering with trade is a capital crime.

## Economy

### Economic Overview
Rivergard's economy runs on trade—specifically, on controlling the flow of goods between the dwarven mountain holds and the outside world. Every bar of iron, every gemstone, every dwarven craft item passes through Rivergard, paying tariffs at each stage. The city produces little raw material but adds value through processing, financing, and transport. The wealth is staggering but concentrated; the twelve Merchant Prince families control more gold than some kingdoms.

### Primary Industries
1. **Trade & Transport:** The core business; warehousing, shipping, and the thousand services traders need.
2. **Banking & Finance:** The Silver-Scale Bank and smaller institutions provide loans, letters of credit, and secure storage. Interest rates are... negotiable.
3. **Glasswork:** Rivergard glass is famous throughout the known world for its clarity and color.
4. **Salvage & Archaeology:** Recovering treasures from the sunken city below is technically illegal without permits, practically unstoppable.

### Trade & Commerce
- **Exports:** Finished goods, glasswork, worked metal, mercenary services, banking services
- **Imports:** Dwarven ore and gems (from Iron Holds via river), grain (from Valdris Vale), timber (from Whisperwood), exotic goods (from overseas)
- **Major Routes:** The River Road north to Highwall and beyond; the Sea Gate for maritime trade; the Canal Network for internal distribution

### Guilds & Merchant Houses

| Organization | Focus | Power Level | Leader |
|--------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| The Silver-Scale Bank | Finance | Immense | Council of Directors |
| Glassblowers' Guild | Craftwork | High | Master Aldric Clearwater |
| [[The Explorers League]] | Exploration, Knowledge | Moderate | Guildmaster Garrick |
| Shipwrights' Guild | Construction | High | Master Elena Deepkeel |
| [[The Black Lotus]] | Crime | High (unofficial) | [[The Nightmaster]] |

## Culture & Society

### City Character
Rivergard is a city of masks—both literal (worn to festivals and certain business dealings) and figurative. Everyone plays a role, everyone has an angle, and trust is a commodity more expensive than gold. Yet beneath the cynicism is genuine civic pride; Rivergardians believe their city is the center of civilization, and they're not entirely wrong. The city values cleverness, presentation, and success; how you achieved it matters less than that you did. Art and culture flourish among the wealthy, while the poor develop their own traditions—often mocking the pretensions of their betters.

### Traditions & Festivals
1. **The Carnival of Masks (Spring):** Week-long festival where identities are hidden and social rules relaxed. Crime spikes but so does commerce. Originated as elven tradition from the sunken city.

2. **The Founding Tide (Summer Solstice):** Celebrates the city's establishment; includes boat races, fireworks, and the ceremonial "drowning of debts" where symbolic contracts are sunk.

3. **The Merchant's Reckoning (Autumn):** When yearly accounts are settled, contracts renewed, and some fortunes made or destroyed overnight.

4. **The Night of Lanterns (Winter):** Floating lights are released on the canals to guide the spirits of the drowned. Somber but beautiful.

5. **Tide's Turn (Monthly):** When the highest tides come, the Drowning Wards partially flood. Residents treat it as festival or disaster depending on severity.

### Religion
**Dominant Faith:** [[The Silver Flame]] officially, but Rivergard's true religion is commerce.

**Religious Tensions:** The temples have influence but not power. The Council tolerates all faiths that don't threaten business. Secret cults—including Covenant of the Unveiled Truth cells—operate in the Drowning Wards.

### Food & Drink
- **Signature Dishes:** Seafood dominates; the Rivergard Fish Stew is famous. Expensive restaurants serve dwarven cuisine at outrageous markups.
- **Drinks:** Siren's Kiss (local brandy), imported dwarven ale (expensive), and canal water (for the desperate).
- **Street Food:** Fried fish on sticks, meat pies of questionable content, and "drowner's bread" (cheap, filling, probably not poisoned).

## Defense & Military

### City Watch (The River Guard)
**Size:** ~2,000 guards; quality varies dramatically by district

**Organization:** Each district has its own captain answering to the Guard-Commander, who answers to the Grand Mayor.

**Corruption Level:** Endemic. Guards in wealthy districts are well-paid and professional; guards in the Drowning Wards are essentially another gang.

### Fortifications
- **Walls:** Ancient elven construction surrounds the core islands, but many areas have no walls at all—the canals are the defense.
- **The Great Chain:** Can seal the harbor but takes hours to raise.
- **Watch Towers:** Scattered throughout; more for observation than combat.

### Military Forces
**Standing Army:** None; Rivergard relies on mercenaries.

**Mercenary Fleet:** The Council maintains contracts with several mercenary companies who provide naval and ground defense.

**Magical Defenses:** Ancient elven wards supposedly protect the city, but they've been weakening for centuries. No one knows how to repair them.

### Threats
- **External:** Pirates from the Shattered Isles; potential naval attack from hostile powers.
- **Internal:** The Black Lotus could paralyze the city if provoked; unrest in the Drowning Wards is always possible; Covenant infiltration.
- **The Rising Waters:** The Drowning Wards are sinking. Some blame natural processes; others, the weakening of elven magic; the Covenant claims the Shackled God weeps.

## History

### Ancient History
Before the city, before humanity's rise, the elves built Ost-in-Edhil—a city of white towers and flowing water, renowned across the [[Age of Myth]] for its beauty and magic. It was a center of learning and art, home to the great elven libraries of the First Age.

### Founding
Ost-in-Edhil sank during [[The Betrayal]], its foundations shattered by the cataclysm. Centuries later, human refugees fleeing the chaos discovered the flooded ruins and realized the remaining islands and stable foundations could support a new settlement. Rivergard was founded approximately 200 RS, growing from a fishing village to a trade town to the metropolis it is today.

### Significant Events
1. **The Raising of the Chain (450 RS):** The Great Chain was forged after pirates nearly sacked the city.
2. **The Plague of Silence (800 RS):** Hit Rivergard hard; the Drowning Wards were quarantined and never recovered.
3. **The Bank War (1200 RS):** Two banking families went to actual war in the canals; resulted in the Silver-Scale Bank's dominance.
4. **The Great Flood (1650 RS):** An entire district sank overnight; thousands died; the Drowning Wards began their current decline.
5. **Lysandra's Election (1980 RS):** The current Grand Mayor takes power after her predecessor's mysterious death.

## Notable Locations

### Landmarks

#### The Sunken City
**Type:** Ancient Ruins
**Description:** Beneath the canals lies Ost-in-Edhil, the elven city that was. On clear days, towers and domes are visible through the water. Some structures breach the surface in the Drowning Wards.
**Significance:** Contains lost knowledge, treasures, and dangers. Exploring it is illegal without permits (expensive and rarely granted) but happens constantly.

#### The Great Chain
**Type:** Defensive Structure
**Description:** A massive iron chain spanning the harbor entrance, held by two ancient towers. Raising it takes hours and significant effort.
**Significance:** Rivergard's primary defense; also symbolic of the city's control over trade.

### Seats of Power

#### The Silver-Scale Bank
**Description:** A fortress disguised as a bank, built into elven foundations. Its vaults extend deep into the sunken city. The architecture is severe and intimidating by design.
**Who's Found Here:** The Banking Council, master accountants, significant portions of the world's gold.
**Access:** Public halls for transactions; private vaults by appointment; deep archives are myths (they exist).

### Entertainment

#### The Siren's Call
**Name:** The Siren's Call
**Proprietor:** Madame Vesper (half-elf, possibly centuries old)
**Clientele:** Wealthy merchants, visiting nobles, anyone with gold
**Character:** Upscale gambling, fine dining, discreet companionship. What happens at the Siren's Call stays there—Madame Vesper has dirt on everyone.

#### The Golden Stage
**Name:** The Golden Stage
**Type:** Theater
**Events:** Plays, operas, and spectacles. Attending opening night is a social necessity for the elite.
**Reputation:** The best entertainment money can buy; also where certain messages are passed between those who can't be seen meeting.

### Underworld

#### The Rat Warrens
**Name:** The Rat Warrens
**Location:** Beneath the Drowning Wards, partially in the sunken city
**Who Runs It:** [[The Black Lotus]]
**Activities:** Smuggling headquarters, black market, assassination contracts, and things no one speaks of.

## Notable Figures

### [[Grand Mayor Lysandra]]
**Title:** Grand Mayor of Rivergard
**Description:** Human woman in her 50s, iron-gray hair, calculating eyes. Rose from the merchant class through marriage, skill, and suspected murder. Rules with intelligence and ruthless pragmatism. Genuinely loves her city; will destroy anyone who threatens it.

### [[The Nightmaster]]
**Position:** Lord of the Black Lotus
**Description:** No one knows their true identity, species, or even if they're one person. The Nightmaster controls Rivergard's criminal underworld through layers of lieutenants. Some believe they're a changeling; others, that "The Nightmaster" is a title passed between leaders.

### Guildmaster Garrick
**Organization:** [[The Explorers League]]
**Description:** Gnome artificer, elderly but energetic, obsessed with the sunken city's secrets. His knowledge of Ost-in-Edhil is unmatched, and he'll pay well for artifacts—or information about what lies in the deepest ruins.

## Criminal Underworld

### Major Criminal Organizations
1. **[[The Black Lotus]]:** Controls the Drowning Wards entirely and has influence throughout the city. Smuggling, protection, assassination, and the black market. Works with the authorities when convenient.

2. **The Canal Rats:** Minor gang of thieves and pickpockets, tolerated because they're useful for information and blamed when things go wrong.

3. **The Merchant Prince's Private Operations:** Several families run their own criminal enterprises through deniable intermediaries.

### Criminal Activities
Everything. If it's illegal, it happens in Rivergard: smuggling (to avoid tariffs), theft (from rich and poor), assassination (political and personal), slavery (officially banned, practically available), and darker things in the deep Drowning Wards.

## Secrets

1. [[Grand Mayor Lysandra]] has a secret alliance with [[The Nightmaster]]—they've agreed to divide the city between legal and illegal operations, sharing intelligence on mutual threats.

2. Deep in the sunken city lies a sealed chamber containing the **Seal of Tides**, an artifact from the Age of Myth that could control the waters around Rivergard. Multiple factions are racing to find it.

3. The rising water in the Drowning Wards is not natural—it's caused by Covenant agents damaging ancient elven water-control systems. They want to create a crisis that destabilizes the city.

4. One of the twelve Merchant Prince families (House Dragen) is secretly controlled by the Covenant of the Unveiled Truth. Their representative on the Council reports everything to the Prophet of Chains.

5. The Silver-Scale Bank's deepest vault contains not gold but something else—an artifact or prisoner from Ost-in-Edhil that the founders sealed away. Even the current bankers don't know what it is.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Sunken Vault:** The party is hired to retrieve the Seal of Tides before the Black Lotus or the Covenant can claim it.

2. **Plague Returns:** Rumors of the Plague of Silence appearing in the Drowning Wards—investigate whether it's real and stop it from spreading.

3. **The Merchant Prince Murder:** A Merchant Prince is found dead in impossible circumstances. The party must solve the murder before the fragile political balance collapses.

4. **Rising Waters:** Investigate why the Drowning Wards are flooding faster than ever—discover and stop the Covenant saboteurs.

5. **The Nightmaster's Invitation:** The party receives a summons from the Nightmaster. Refusing is dangerous; accepting means entering the criminal underworld's web.

6. **Lost in the Depths:** A scholar vanished exploring the sunken city. Rescue mission into the flooded elven ruins.
