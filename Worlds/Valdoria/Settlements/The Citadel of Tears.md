# The Citadel of Tears

> [!info] Character Summary
> An ancient, imposing fortress built into the side of the Sundered Peaks during the Age of Myth, constructed by the Architects of Dawn to watch over the First Seal binding [[The Shackled God]]. Named for the constant waterfalls that pour from its high gargoyles, feeding the teardrop-shaped lake below. Though the world believes it abandoned for centuries, [[The Cult of the Shackled God]] has secretly occupied the lower levels and works to break the seal that could unleash devastation upon the world.

## Overview

The Citadel of Tears rises from the northern face of Mount Nirnaeth like a monument to an age when mortals and gods worked together against primordial darkness. Its black stone towers pierce the clouds, while streams of water cascade perpetually from gargoyle-mouthed aqueducts, giving the fortress its mournful name. For eight hundred years, the world has believed it abandoned—a haunted ruin where the ghosts of ancient guardians still walk the empty halls. This is exactly what the Cult wants everyone to believe. In the fortress's deepest chambers, where the First Seal pulses with weakening divine light, cultists labor day and night to complete the work their prophet has foreseen: the breaking of chains that have bound a god for millennia.

## Classification

### Stronghold Type
**Type:** Mountain Citadel / Sealed Prison Garrison

**Primary Purpose:** Defense and containment of the First Seal; now subverted to seal-breaking operations

**Age:** Ancient (Age of Myth construction, approximately 3,000 years old)

**Condition:** Deteriorating on surface; secretly maintained in depths

## Geography

### Location
The Citadel clings to the northern face of Mount Nirnaeth in the [[Sundered Peaks]], 8,000 feet above the valley floor. The mountain itself was chosen because it sits directly above a nexus of ley lines that the Architects of Dawn used to power the First Seal. Below the fortress, Teardrop Lake fills a glacier-carved basin, its waters eternally cold and unnaturally still. The nearest settlement is [[Karak-Zul]], the dwarven hold, some forty miles to the southeast—but the dwarves avoid this region, calling it "The Weeping."

### Approaches
**Primary Approach:** A treacherous mountain path winds up from the valley, carved into the cliff face with switchbacks every hundred yards. In good weather, the climb takes two days. In bad weather, it's suicide.

**Difficulty:** Extreme—the path was designed to be defensible, with multiple chokepoints, and centuries of neglect have left sections crumbling.

**What Attackers Face:** Falling rocks, ice-covered surfaces, wind strong enough to throw a man off the cliff, and—though few realize it—undead sentinels who still patrol the upper approaches.

**Hidden Approaches:**
- An ancient service tunnel emerges in the Teardrop Lake, accessible only by swimming through freezing water
- A collapsed mining shaft connects to the dwarven Deep Roads (now orc-controlled)
- A portal in the deepest level connects to the Seal Chamber—but only the Cult knows how to activate it

### Climate & Environment
The Citadel exists in perpetual winter. Snow falls eight months of the year, and even in summer, temperatures rarely rise above freezing. The constant cascade of water creates a permanent mist that rises from the lake below, sometimes engulfing the lower towers entirely. Lightning storms are frequent, and the fortress's highest towers are regularly struck—their ancient lightning rods directing the energy into the ground, where it once powered defensive enchantments.

## Fortifications

### Outer Defenses
The approach path is the primary defense:
- **The Gauntlet:** A mile-long section where the path narrows to single-file, with murder holes carved above
- **The First Gate:** Collapsed but still partially blocked by massive stone doors
- **The Bridge of Sighs:** A 200-foot span over a chasm, now missing its middle section (the Cult uses ropes)
- **Undead Patrols:** Skeletal archers left by the original defenders still walk the upper approaches, attacking any living creature that isn't warded

### Walls
**The Outer Curtain:**
- **Construction:** Black mountain stone fused with magical reinforcement
- **Height:** 60 feet where intact; partially collapsed in three sections
- **Thickness:** 20 feet at base
- **Condition:** Crumbling on the surface; deliberately left ruined to discourage exploration
- **Special Features:** Weeping gargoyles that were once defensive constructs; most are now inert

**The Inner Ward:**
- **Construction:** Same black stone, better preserved
- **Height:** 40 feet
- **Condition:** Structurally sound but appearing ruined
- **Special Features:** Hidden entrance to the lower levels disguised as rubble

### Towers
- **Number:** Seven major towers, four still standing
- **Types:** Three defensive towers, three residential/service towers, one central keep
- **Height:** Ranging from 80 to 150 feet
- **Armament:** Original ballistae long since destroyed; undead archers in the Tower of Vigils

**The Tower of Weeping:** Tallest surviving structure, 150 feet, where the primary water channel emerges. Its constant cascade masks sounds from below.

### Gates
**Main Gate (The Gates of Dawn):**
- Original massive bronze doors, 40 feet tall, now permanently open and corroded
- Gatehouse collapsed but still navigable
- Murder holes and portcullis mechanisms still present but non-functional
- The Cult maintains hidden observers here

**Secondary Entrances:**
- **The Servant's Postern:** Small door in the eastern wall, buried under rubble but clearable
- **The Water Gate:** Access point where the aqueduct system enters, partly submerged
- **The Seal Path:** A hidden stairway in the Keep that descends directly to the Seal Chamber

### Keep/Central Structure
**The Hall of Vigils:**
- **Type:** Tower keep merged with mountain
- **Height:** 120 feet above ground; extends 400 feet below
- **Purpose:** Originally the headquarters of the Seal Guardians; now Cult command center (in lower levels)
- **Notable Features:** The great hall contains statues of the original guardian heroes whose stone eyes seem to track intruders; their spirits may still linger

### Siege Defenses
**Original Capabilities (mostly lost):**
- Anti-siege weapons: Destroyed
- Stores: Ancient supplies long since rotted
- Water: Unlimited from the aqueducts (still functional)
- Escape: The portal could evacuate the garrison to a secondary location (coordinates lost)

**Current Cult Defenses:**
- Stores: Supplies for six months, brought in through the Deep Roads tunnel
- Summoned creatures: Cultist priests can call shadow entities
- The Seal itself: Anyone approaching the Seal Chamber without proper wards suffers psychic assault

## Garrison

### Historical Garrison (Age of Myth)
The Seal Guardians numbered 500 at their height—elite warriors blessed by the gods themselves. They held this fortress for centuries until [[The Betrayal]] and the subsequent chaos led to their gradual diminishment. The last true Guardian died in 1187 RS, leaving only the undead remnants of their oaths.

### Current Garrison (Cult Forces)
**Total Strength:** ~350 (150 cultists, 200 enslaved workers and summoned creatures)

| Unit Type | Number | Quality | Role |
|-----------|--------|---------|------|
| Cult Priests | 12 | Elite | Leadership, ritual work |
| Cult Warriors | 80 | Veteran | Security, defense |
| Cult Initiates | 60 | Poor | Labor, basic tasks |
| Shadow-Touched Thralls | 50 | Variable | Expendable frontline |
| Enslaved Workers | 40 | Non-combatant | Mining, construction |
| Summoned Shadows | Variable | Elite | Assassination, patrol |

### Command Structure
**Commander:** High Priest Malchar (reports directly to [[The Prophet of Chains]])
- **Appearance:** A gaunt human male whose left arm has been replaced with shadow-stuff that writhes like a living thing
- **Experience:** Thirty years serving the Cult, fifteen as a priest
- **Leadership Style:** Fanatical devotion; views all deaths (including his own) as acceptable sacrifice for the Shackled God's release

**Officers:**
1. **Priestess Vorenna:** Second-in-command, oversees the actual seal-breaking rituals
2. **Captain Dusk:** Former mercenary, leads the warrior contingent
3. **The Whisperer:** A shadow entity bound to serve as chief torturer and interrogator

### Garrison Life
Cult members live in the restored lower levels, where ancient heating enchantments still function. Days are divided between labor on the seal, worship services, and training. Morale is high among true believers, who see themselves as chosen instruments of divine liberation. The enslaved workers live in considerably worse conditions—cold cells in the service levels, fed barely enough to work.

### Training
- **Facilities:** A cleared section of the undercroft serves as training hall
- **Focus:** Combined arms combat with emphasis on fighting in darkness
- **Quality:** Moderate; religious fervor compensates for inconsistent skill
- **Specialization:** Shadow magic integration; fighting alongside summoned entities

## Support Population

### Civilians
**Total Civilian Population:** ~200 (all involuntary)

**Types:**
- **Enslaved Workers (40):** Captured travelers, failed cultists, and villagers from distant settlements
- **Corrupted Servants (10):** Once-human creatures transformed by shadow exposure
- **Bound Spirits (unknown number):** The ghosts of original Guardians, trapped and tormented

### Essential Personnel
- **Smith:** A captured dwarf smith, Borin Chainbreaker, forced to create tools for seal-breaking
- **Cook:** A cultist named Salla who takes disturbing pleasure in her work
- **Healer:** Priestess Vorenna doubles as healer, using shadow magic with terrible side effects
- **Quartermaster:** Brother Graves, responsible for supplies brought through the tunnels

### Living Conditions
- **Cult Elite:** Comfortable chambers in the restored inner keep
- **Regular Cultists:** Dormitories, adequate but spartan
- **Slaves:** Cold cells, minimal food, brutal treatment
- **Morale:** High among believers, nonexistent among captives

## Strategic Role

### Original Purpose
The Citadel was built to house the First Seal and the guardians who protected it. Five seals were created to bind [[The Shackled God]], spread across the continent. The First Seal was considered most important—located closest to the prison itself—and received the strongest fortification.

### Current Purpose
[[The Cult of the Shackled God]] seeks to break all five seals and release their imprisoned deity. The First Seal is their primary target, and they have been working on it for twenty years. Progress is slow but measurable—the seal grows visibly dimmer each year.

### Tactical Value
**Defensive Value:** Critical (nearly impregnable if properly garrisoned)
**Offensive Value:** Low (too remote to project power)
**Symbolic Value:** Extreme (the seal's location makes this the most important site in the world)

### What Happens If It Falls
If the Cult succeeds in breaking the First Seal, the binding on [[The Shackled God]] weakens catastrophically. The prison won't fully open—four seals remain—but enough power will leak that the Shackled God can begin influencing the world directly: driving cultists mad with visions, corrupting the land around seal points, and potentially reaching out to touch select individuals.

### Supply & Logistics
- **Supply Routes:** Through the Deep Roads connection (partially collapsed, orc-guarded)
- **Storage Capacity:** Six months of supplies in the lower storerooms
- **Self-Sufficiency:** Water is unlimited; food must be imported
- **Vulnerability:** The supply route through the Deep Roads is the Cult's greatest weakness

### Communication
- **Magical:** Sending spells to Covenant cells in major cities
- **Physical:** Rare messengers through the Deep Roads
- **Emergency:** A signal fire system that could alert... no one (the Cult doesn't want attention)
- **Response Time:** Weeks for any outside help to arrive; the Cult relies on secrecy, not reinforcement

## Command & Control

### Controlling Power
**Faction:** [[The Cult of the Shackled God]], itself a branch of [[The Covenant of the Unveiled Truth]]
**Direct Superior:** [[The Prophet of Chains]]
**Autonomy Level:** High—communication with the Prophet is rare
**Political Importance:** The single most important Cult operation in the world

### Chain of Command
- High Priest Malchar commands all Cult forces
- He reports to the Prophet through dreams and visions rather than messages
- Emergency succession: Priestess Vorenna, then Captain Dusk
- Conflicting authorities: The Prophet's dream-commands sometimes contradict Malchar's judgment

### Laws & Discipline
Cult law is simple:
- Serve the Shackled God above all
- Obey the priests
- Death is preferable to capture
- Failure is unacceptable but can be redeemed through sacrifice

Punishments range from ritual scarring to shadow-exposure (which slowly transforms victims into thralls) to execution. Desertion is theoretically impossible—the Cult knows each member's true name and can track them through shadow magic.

## History

### Construction
The Citadel of Tears was built in the final centuries of [[The Age of Myth]], after [[The Shackled God]] was imprisoned but before the other Primal Gods withdrew from the world. The Architects of Dawn—a coalition of elven, dwarven, and human master builders guided by divine instruction—constructed the fortress over a period of sixty years. The stone itself was quarried from the mountain using magic that has since been lost.

### Battles & Sieges
1. **The First Testing (Year 12 of imprisonment):**
   - Cultists who had evaded capture during the god's binding attempted to reach the seal
   - Two hundred attackers against fifty guardians
   - Outcome: Total cultist defeat; no breach of the inner ward
   - Impact: Established the Seal Guardians as an elite order

2. **The Orc Tide (842 RS):**
   - A massive orc migration threatened the Citadel
   - 10,000 orcs against 400 guardians
   - Outcome: Guardian victory through defensive superiority and magical support
   - Impact: Orcs never again approached the Citadel; called it "The Weeping Death"

3. **The Abandonment (1187 RS):**
   - Not a battle but a quiet ending
   - The last Guardian captain died of age, leaving only sixteen aging warriors
   - They chose to become undead through ritual, permanently bound to patrol the upper levels
   - Impact: The surface became "haunted," discouraging visitors while leaving the seal unguarded

4. **The Cult Infiltration (1967 RS):**
   - A small team of Cult agents found the Deep Roads entrance
   - They spent two years clearing paths and mapping the lower levels
   - The first ritual began in 1969 RS
   - The seal has been weakening ever since

### Famous Defenders
- **Captain Aelindra:** Elven commander who held the Bridge of Sighs alone against a hundred orcs
- **Brother Vigilance:** Human priest-warrior who maintained the wards for three centuries
- **The Last Sixteen:** The guardians who chose undeath to protect the empty fortress

### Current Situation
The Cult has operated here for twenty years without discovery. Their progress on the seal is accelerating—what once took years of ritual now advances monthly. High Priest Malchar has received visions that the seal will break within two years if nothing intervenes. Recent events trouble him: the increased corruption spreading from seal-points has begun attracting attention. The dwarves have sent patrols toward the mountains. Adventurers have been spotted in the region. The greatest strength of the operation—its secrecy—may be failing.

## Notable Locations

### 1. The Gates of Dawn
**Description:** Massive bronze doors, tarnished green with age, standing permanently open. The gatehouse above has partially collapsed, revealing ancient murder holes now blocked with debris.
**Defenses:** Cult observers watch from hidden positions; undead patrol nearby
**Who Guards It:** A rotating pair of cultists disguised as pilgrims who warn the interior of any approach

### 2. The Hall of Vigils
**Description:** A vast stone chamber where statues of the original guardian heroes stand in eternal watch. The ceiling rises sixty feet, covered in a mosaic depicting the binding of the Shackled God. Some of the statues' eyes glow faintly with trapped souls.
**Functions:** Originally the ceremonial heart of the fortress; now the Cult uses it as a gathering space for major rituals
**Access:** Open but watched; the main stairway down begins here

### 3. The Barracks Level
**Description:** Originally housing for 500 guardians, now mostly collapsed. The Cult has restored a section for their warriors.
**Capacity:** Currently houses 80 Cult warriors in cramped conditions
**Conditions:** Cold, damp, but functional

### 4. The Armory
**Description:** Once containing blessed weapons for the guardians, long since looted. The Cult has established their own weapon stores here.
**Contents:** Mundane weapons, several enchanted blades of shadow, ritual implements
**Security:** Locked and warded; Captain Dusk holds the key

### 5. The Weeping Cisterns
**Description:** A massive underground reservoir fed by the aqueducts above. The water is pure and cold, channeled through ancient dwarven engineering.
**Uses:** Water supply; the Cult also uses it for water-breathing entry
**Note:** The cistern connects to submerged passages that lead outside the fortress

### 6. The Slave Pits
**Description:** Former storage chambers converted to hold captives. Iron cages line walls carved from living rock.
**Capacity:** Currently holds 40 enslaved workers
**Current Prisoners:** Includes three missing hunters from [[Oakhaven]], a dwarven smith, and various travelers

### 7. The Shadow Temple
**Description:** A chamber the Cult has consecrated to their god. Black stone altar, walls covered in prophecy-writings, air thick with incense that induces visions.
**Dedicated To:** [[The Shackled God]]
**Chaplain:** Priestess Vorenna leads daily worship

### 8. The Seal Chamber
**Description:** A circular room 100 feet in diameter, carved directly above the ley line nexus. The First Seal dominates the center—a disc of pure light 30 feet across, embedded in the floor, covered in divine script that pulses with diminishing power. Cracks have begun to spread across its surface, leaking violet darkness.
**Access:** Only priests may enter; heavy wards on all approaches
**The Work:** Teams of ritualists work around the clock, chanting counter-prayers that unweave the seal's magic

### 9. The Tower of Weeping
**Description:** The highest intact tower, where the aqueduct water emerges and cascades down the fortress face. The sound of falling water masks sounds from below.
**Uses:** Observation post; ritual focus for water-based divination
**Schedule:** Cult observer at all times

### 10. The Deep Way
**Description:** A tunnel descending from the fortress's lowest level into the abandoned reaches of the Deep Roads. Partially collapsed, requiring navigation through tight spaces.
**Who Knows:** The Cult uses this as their supply route; orcs occasionally probe from the other direction
**Danger:** Unstable sections, orc patrols, and something worse that watches from the deepest dark

## Notable Figures

### Commander
**Name:** High Priest Malchar
**Rank:** High Priest of the Shackled God
**Description:** A gaunt human in his fifties with hollow eyes and skin that has taken on a grayish pallor from years underground. His left arm was lost in a ritual accident and has been replaced with concentrated shadow that functions as a limb but cannot hold solid objects for long. He wears robes of deep purple inscribed with silver chains. His voice is soft and measured, but his eyes burn with absolute conviction. He has given everything to see his god freed and will give more.

### Second-in-Command
**Name:** Priestess Vorenna
**Rank:** High Priestess, Seal-Breaker
**Description:** An elven woman, shockingly young to have risen so high (barely 200), with white hair that darkens to black at the tips. She leads the actual seal-breaking rituals, having developed techniques that have accelerated the work.
**Relationship with Commander:** Respectful but competitive; she believes she should lead the operation

### Master-at-Arms
**Name:** Captain Dusk (born Edric Malloran)
**Description:** A broad-shouldered human mercenary who joined the Cult after they spared his life during a botched robbery. He has no true faith but enjoys the power and fears what he's seen of the shadow magic.
**Reputation:** Brutal, effective, pragmatic

### Quartermaster
**Name:** Brother Graves
**Description:** A wheezing, obsequious man responsible for managing the Cult's supplies and the slave population
**Challenges:** The supply line is increasingly unreliable; orc activity in the Deep Roads is increasing

### Spiritual Advisor
**Name:** The Whisperer
**Type:** Bound shadow entity
**Description:** A creature of living darkness bound to serve the Cult's leadership. It cannot exist in direct sunlight but is invaluable for interrogation and assassination.
**Role:** Extracts information from captives; eliminates threats through dreams

### Veteran Cultist
**Name:** Sister Fae
**Description:** An elderly human woman who has served the Cult for sixty years, since before the Citadel operation began. She remembers when the faith was hunted nearly to extinction.
**What She's Seen:** The slow growth from desperate cult to organized conspiracy
**Respect Level:** High among true believers; seen as a living saint

### Troublemaker
**Name:** Borin Chainbreaker
**Role:** Enslaved Dwarf Smith
**Description:** A dwarf captured from [[The Iron Holds]] five years ago, forced to create tools for seal-breaking. He has sabotaged his work when possible but fears retaliation.
**Potential Hook:** He knows the fortress layout and would give anything to escape and warn the dwarves

## Threats & Concerns

### External Threats
- **Discovery:** The greatest threat—if Aerendor, the Dwarves, or the Grey Wardens learn the truth
- **Dwarf Patrols:** [[High King Thrain IV]] has increased activity in the region
- **The Iron Holds:** If the dwarves reclaim the Deep Roads, the supply route fails
- **Adventurers:** Random heroes stumbling onto the truth

### Internal Threats
- **Seal Instability:** As the seal weakens, it becomes more dangerous—unpredictable releases of divine energy
- **The Whisperer's Ambition:** The bound shadow grows stronger with each soul it consumes
- **Priestess Vorenna:** Her ambition may lead her to act against Malchar
- **Slave Rebellion:** The captives are desperate; one success could cascade

### Weaknesses
1. **Single Supply Line:** The Deep Roads tunnel is the only reliable way to bring supplies
2. **Secrecy Dependence:** The operation cannot survive open battle
3. **The Seal Itself:** Divine energy near the seal is painful to shadow-touched; work must be done in shifts
4. **The Undead:** The ancient guardian undead above are unpredictable; they sometimes attack cultists

## Secrets

1. **The Seal's True Nature:** Breaking the First Seal won't just weaken the binding—it will release a pulse of corrupting energy across the continent. Every seal-point will flare, and shadow creatures will pour through temporary rifts.

2. **The Prophet's Location:** High Priest Malchar knows where [[The Prophet of Chains]] hides—in the ruins beneath [[Rivergard]] itself, in tunnels even the Nightmaster doesn't know about.

3. **The Counter-Seal:** The Architects of Dawn built a failsafe into each seal—a ritual that could reinforce it, potentially permanently. The instructions are carved into the walls of the Seal Chamber, but the Cult has covered them with their own writings. Cleaning those walls would reveal the ritual.

4. **Borin's Work:** The dwarf smith has been secretly creating a map and sending fragments out with each shipment of broken tools. He's hoping someone in the Deep Roads will find them and understand.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Missing Patrol:** A squad from [[The Iron Holds]] went to investigate strange lights on the mountain and never returned. [[High King Thrain IV]] wants answers.

2. **The Light in the Tower:** Travelers report seeing illumination in the Tower of Weeping, which should be abandoned. Someone wants the rumors investigated.

3. **The Escaped Slave:** One of the captives escapes and makes it to civilization, bearing news of what's happening inside—but the Cult is hunting them.

4. **The Deep Roads Connection:** While exploring the orc-held Deep Roads, the party discovers the tunnel leading to the Citadel.

5. **The Failing Seals:** As the First Seal weakens, effects spread outward. Investigating the corruption leads inevitably here.

## Tactical Notes

### Defensive Advantages
- Nearly impregnable approach path
- Ancient wards still function (though weakened)
- Defenders know every secret passage
- Undead on surface create confusion
- The Cult can collapse tunnels to prevent pursuit

### Defensive Disadvantages
- Secrecy is the primary defense; once blown, the Cult cannot hold against a real army
- Limited numbers; cannot absorb significant casualties
- The seal's energy is dangerous to shadow-touched defenders
- The undead may attack anyone, including cultists

### Siege Duration
The Cult could hold against a siege indefinitely if supplied through the Deep Roads, but could not survive more than two weeks cut off.

### Capture Methods
- **Stealth:** Small party infiltration through the water gate or Deep Roads
- **Information:** Freed slaves could provide detailed intelligence
- **Divine Intervention:** Priests of the Silver Flame or similar faiths could potentially reinforce the wards, trapping the Cult inside
- **Assault:** Would require significant force (500+ troops) and acceptance of heavy casualties on the approach
