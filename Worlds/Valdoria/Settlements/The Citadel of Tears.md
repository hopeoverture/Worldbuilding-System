# The Citadel of Tears

> [!info] Generation Instructions
> An ancient, imposing fortress built into the side of a mountain. It was once the primary garrison for the guardians of the Shackled God's prison. Now, it is a haunted ruin that "weeps" waterfalls from high aqueducts.

## Overview
Amon Nirnaeth was built in the Age of Myth to watch over the northern valleys. It is named for the constant streams of water that pour from its high gargoyles, feeding the teardrop-shaped lake below. It has been abandoned for centuries—or so the world believes. In truth, the Cult has taken residence in the lower levels, slowly chipping away at the First Seal located in the deep crypts.

## Key Areas
1.  **The Hall of Vigils:** The main keep, where statues of ancient heroes stand watch. Their eyes seem to follow intruders.
2.  **The Weeping Cisterns:** A massive underground reservoir system.
3.  **The Seal Chamber (Deep Level):** A circular room sealed by divine magic. The cracks in the floor pulse with violet light.

## Inhabitants
- **Surface:** Undead sentinels (skeletal archers) left by the old defenders.
- **Depths:** Cultists and their summoned horrors.

## Plot Hooks
1.  **The Light in the Tower:** Travelers report seeing a light in the high tower, which should be empty.
2.  **The Missing Patrol:** A squad from [[The Iron Holds]] went to investigate and never returned.

## Image Prompts
### Exterior
**Prompt:** A tall, gothic fortress carved from black stone, clinging to a snowy mountain cliff. Waterfalls pour from gargoyle mouths into the mist below. Dark, foreboding, epic scale.
