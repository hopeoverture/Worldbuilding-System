# Valdoria

> [!quote] The Sundered Realm
> *"In the age before ages, when the world was young and the stars sang with joy, the Architects of Dawn shaped Valdoria from light and stone. They bound the nameless darkness beneath the roots of mountains, sealing it with oaths unbreakable—or so they believed. Now the seals crack, the oaths fade, and those who serve the darkness walk among us wearing the faces of friends."*
> — Fragment from the Scroll of Endings

## Premise

Valdoria is a land of ancient kingdoms and forgotten glory, where the memory of a golden age lingers like smoke from a dying fire. Millennia ago, the Architects of Dawn—beings of immense power whose true nature is now lost to myth—imprisoned a nameless evil beneath the world. For three thousand years, their seals held. Now, the bindings weaken. Strange dreams plague the gifted. Old wards fail. And in the halls of power, whispers speak of a new faith spreading—one that promises salvation but serves a far darker master.

The corruption has already taken root. Advisors to kings hear voices in the dark. Merchant lords fund expeditions to forbidden ruins. Priests find their prayers answered by something other than their gods. The servants of the ancient evil do not announce themselves with fire and shadow—they smile, they advise, they wait. By the time the kingdoms realize the threat, it may already be too late.

## Tone & Themes

### Core Tone
**Epic Fantasy with Mature Themes** — Valdoria embraces the grandeur and heroism of classic epic fantasy while unflinching in its portrayal of violence, moral complexity, and the personal costs of conflict. Good and evil exist, but the lines blur in shadow. Heroes make terrible choices. Villains believe themselves righteous.

### Key Themes
- **Corruption from Within** — The greatest threat wears a friendly face. Trust is precious and dangerous.
- **Legacy of the Past** — Ancient powers, forgotten oaths, and buried secrets shape the present.
- **The Cost of Power** — Magic, authority, and knowledge all demand sacrifice.
- **Unlikely Heroes** — Greatness rises from unexpected places when the old guardians fail.
- **Fading Light** — Beauty and hope exist, but must be fought for against encroaching darkness.

### Content Notes
No restrictions on mature themes within the epic fantasy context. Violence, political intrigue, betrayal, and dark magic are integral to the world.

## The Current Crisis

### The Awakening
The ancient evil—known only in fragmentary texts as **The Imprisoned** or **The First Shadow**—stirs in its prison beneath the Sundered Peaks. Its dreams bleed into reality. Those sensitive to magic suffer visions of drowning in darkness. Animals flee the mountains. The earth trembles in places it never has before.

### The Corruption
More insidious than the Imprisoned's physical awakening is the work of its servants. The **Covenant of the Unveiled Truth** presents itself as a mystery cult offering spiritual enlightenment through meditation and self-discovery. In truth, it serves as a network for the Imprisoned's corruption, identifying and turning individuals in positions of influence.

The Covenant has infiltrated:
- At least two royal courts
- The merchant guilds controlling northern trade
- Several prominent temples
- The leadership of at least one mage academy

### Ticking Clocks
1. **The Seals** — Three of seven seals have already weakened. When the fourth fails, the Imprisoned will be able to project its will into the world directly.
2. **The War** — The Covenant manipulates tensions between kingdoms toward open conflict, which will weaken all parties and distract from the true threat.
3. **The Purge** — Those who discover the truth tend to die in "accidents" or are discredited as madmen. The few who know the scope of the danger grow fewer each month.

## Magic System
See [[Magic System of Valdoria]] for full details on:
- **The Veiled Arts** — Magic is uncommon, feared, and hunted
- **Three traditions** — Arcane, Divine, and Primal (plus Forbidden)
- **The persecution** — Inquisitors hunt mages while the Covenant recruits them
- **Current crisis** — Divine magic weakens as the seals fail

## The Divine
See [[Pantheon of Valdoria]] for full details on:
- **The Seven Thrones** — Seven gods of unknown nature who guide through subtle signs
- **Divine silence** — Prayers increasingly go unanswered; divine magic weakens
- **The Eighth God** — An empty throne, a forbidden name, a secret waiting to be discovered
- **Ancient wounds** — The gods bear scars from the conflict that imprisoned the ancient evil

## Cosmology
See [[Cosmology of Valdoria]] for full details on:
- **The Nine Planes** — Material, Feywild, Shadowfell, Elemental, Divine, Infernal, Astral, Ethereal, and the Prison
- **Natural portals** — Crossings exist where reality thins
- **The Prison** — A dimensional wound containing the Imprisoned, sealed by the Architects
- **Planar bleeding** — The weakening seals destabilize all planar boundaries

## Geography
See [[Thondorian]] for full details on:
- **The Land of Stone and Wood** — A temperate continent dotted with ancient ruins
- **The Sundered Peaks** — Central mountain range where the seals weaken
- **Nine regions** — Westmark, Greenfields, Whisperwood, Valdris Vale, Mirelands, Pale North, Ashlands, Eastern Frontier, and the Deep Roads beneath

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Dreaming Sickness** — A plague of nightmares spreads through a town. The afflicted share the same vision: darkness rising, chains breaking, a voice promising release.

2. **The Trusted Advisor** — A noble's closest confidant is secretly Covenant. The heroes must expose the traitor without proof—and without becoming targets themselves.

3. **The Sealed Door** — Deep in ancient ruins, a door bears wards from the Age of Dawn. Something behind it whispers promises of power. The Covenant wants it opened.

4. **The Last Guardian** — An ancient order swore to watch the seals. One member remains, old and alone, seeking successors before the final ward falls.

5. **The Heretic's Truth** — A priest is executed for claiming the gods have gone silent. But what if they weren't mad? What if something is blocking divine power?

## Session Zero Notes

### For Dungeon Masters
- The Covenant's infiltration should be a slow revelation. Early adventures may not even hint at the conspiracy.
- The ancient evil should remain mysterious. Fear of the unknown is more powerful than a named threat.
- Balance hope with dread. Victory should be possible, but earned through sacrifice.
- NPCs should have their own agendas. Not everyone who opposes the heroes is Covenant, and not everyone who helps them is trustworthy.

### For Players
- Your characters live in a world that feels stable but wrong. Something is off, even if they can't name it.
- Trust should be roleplayed carefully. The paranoia is intentional.
- Ancient history matters. Scholars, archaeologists, and historians have crucial knowledge.
- The small victories matter. Every Covenant agent exposed, every seal reinforced, every life saved pushes back the darkness.
